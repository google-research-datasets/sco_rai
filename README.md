# SCO-RAI: Societal Context Ontology for Responsible AI

This repository contains the SCO-RAI Ontology and raw CSV annotations dataset for the paper: TODO: add paper after pre-print available

## Overview
SCO-RAI Ontology (OWL in RDF/XML format) includes both the base ontology and all annotations modeled as namedIndividuals, objectProperties and annotationProperties.
CSV annotations are the raw annotations mentioned in the paper, which have been used to create the merged SCO-RAI Ontology file (sco-rai.owl).

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains 154 excerpts taken from 153 papers published in the 2023 proceedings of the ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (ACM FAccT).
The dataset is stored in an RDF/XML format representation of an OWL ontology based knowledge graph. Nodes of the knowledge graph identify the key agents, artifacts, and
precepts in each excerpt. Triples of the knowledge graph describe key relationships between the agents, precepts, and artifacts, as described in the relevant excerpts.
