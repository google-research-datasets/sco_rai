In this section, we discuss personal and organizational factors which affect practitioners’ ability to see their concerns satisfactorily resolved, including financial and immigration precarity, company culture, and organizational incentives.5.1 Financial and Immigration PrecarityWhile some software engineers felt comfortable turning down jobs(Sec. 4.4) or quitting their current jobs (Sec. 4.3) over ethical con-cerns, many practitioners expressed financial limitations on their power to act on their concerns. One explained how concerns overprecarity took priority over ethics: “Any kind of precarity will makeyour weigh your ethics less, right? [...] having a family, having de-pendents who can’t support themselves, [...] medical conditions [andgiven this] you kind of are able to talk yourself into, hey, [...] I don’treally have a choice.” (I2) When asked about anything that made it harder to act, survey respondents echoed this: “The need to providea living for me and my family, together with high prices” (S82), “Re-liance on the job to survive” (S8), and simply: “Money.” (S77) Survey respondents also cited financial stability making it easier to act: “I was single, didn’t have a lot of debt” (S20),“I had a decent savings and could afford to drop the client.” (S62) One interviewee describeda stark example: “aside from [the ethical concern...] my father ha dpassed, and so I got some life insurance money [...] so I didn’t necessarily need the paycheck anymore.” (I21) Support networks mitigate precarity: “[My parents] said [...] they would help [me not] get put out on the street.” (I10), but so does lacking dependents to support:“I’m only supporting myself.” (I11) Precarity from employment-based immigration visas (e.g., USH1B visas [21]) also influenced whether practitioners decide to takeaction, one interviewee making clear he would only ever leave a job if he had another opportunity lined up. He said a semi-permanentstate of precarity leaves immigrants less freedom act on their ethicalscruples: “Indians on H1Bs [often] need to find something [a job]within a very short period of time or actually have to leave the country.And when that happens, you end up taking whatever is available.” (I2) Practitioners were also worried about blacklisting, as one stated fear over “getting [...] bad recommendations from former employers.”(I10) One interviewee described being blacklisted after raising anethics concern: “[the director] sort of ended it with like [...] I can’tfire you. Because you’re in contract. But like, know this: the aid sectoris small. And your career here is like pretty much over.” (I9)5.2 Workplace CultureRespondents described how their organization’s culture – includingnorms, expected practices, and communication styles – affectedtheir willingness to raise concerns. For example, participants cited “trust and respect [and] a common goal” (S71) and an “‘Open door’policy [...] easy to get 1-on-1 time with execs” (S52) as things that made it easier to act on concerns. However, more respondents described “hostile” (S72), “authoritarian/passive aggressive management style[...] hierarchical culture” (S110), “suggestions from higher-ups that ethics discussions were a waste of time.” (S52) as things making itmore difficult to act on their concerns. Interviewees expanded on this, one (I10) contrasted his two consulting experiences: the first where he worked in cubicles “in a building full of thousands of people and feel lonely” (I10), and the second where he “had good rapport”and “trusted” his client and therefore felt “safe” to bring up his concerns. However, some participants said “friendly” cultures made it harder to raise concerns. For example, survey respondents recalled that because “The boss was a friendly chap” (S104) or “bonding attempts from the owners” (S68) made it harder to raise concerns. One interviewee said that remote work meant fewer social ties, which made it easier to escalate his concerns: “This remote way of work-ing [...] helped me to create [...] this disconnection with the manager[which] helped me to say [...] I care less about your opinion on this.”(I14)5.3 Organizational Incentives Participants demonstrated an acute awareness of organizational incentives, and used them to reason about their power to act on their ethical concerns. Profit motives lead to ethical concerns, as many survey respondents identified explicitly: “features were imple-mented to earn money by any means necessary” (S69) or “they were selling geolocation data because it’s worth a lot of money.” (S67) One interviewee said that financial struggles lead to “uncomfortable” tradeoffs: “between the choice of closing the business [versus] doingsomething uncomfortable, almost everyone chooses to do something uncomfortable,” (I7) recalling that a previous employer sold user data to advertisers when “scrambling [to find] some new revenue stream?” (I7) As seen in Section 4.2, practitioners couched ethicalconcerns within organizational incentives to gain support. Consequently, one interviewee described how “ethics wins” were not about an “ethical concern, but a marketing concern, to be honest. And the way that incentives align.” (I2)Other practitioners suggested that it is easier to resolve ethics concerns at government agencies and nonprofits, as one interviewee who had recently transitioned into public service described: “you’re pursuing your goods beyond profit, right? [...] versus ‘we want tomake money’.” (I5) One interviewee doing software engineering at a public university described how state funding shaped project priorities, at least in the ideal: “If the companies paid us, I guess the situation would have been a bit different. But we [wanted] to workin the best interest of the people [...] we are paid by the people’s taxmoney.” (I20), but another academic described how pressures to publish led to his concerns about research integrity. Multiple contractors and consultants described needing to com-promise ethics to appease clients. One interviewee who resigned from a consulting project after being asked to do something illegal said: “Your interactions with the client weigh very heavily on future decisions for future engagements and contracts. So there’s a lot of pressure [...] to get along with the client. [...] If your client asks you to do something you don’t want to do, too bad.” (I12) This appeared especially pronounced at financially precarious firms who felt the need to “act on clients’ whim[s]” (I71) , or non-profits who feel ac-countable to donors rather than beneficiaries, where donors may instead have less beneficent geopolitical interests: “the goals of the[project], are largely to keep refugees [...] in the Middle East. So they don't affect people in Europe.” (I9)",473,SOFTWARE ENGINEERS [...] practitioners,

In this section, we discuss personal and organizational factors which affect practitioners’ ability to see their concerns satisfactorily resolved, including financial and immigration precarity, company culture, and organizational incentives.5.1 Financial and Immigration PrecarityWhile some software engineers felt comfortable turning down jobs(Sec. 4.4) or quitting their current jobs (Sec. 4.3) over ethical con-cerns, many practitioners expressed financial limitations on their power to act on their concerns. One explained how concerns overprecarity took priority over ethics: “Any kind of precarity will makeyour weigh your ethics less, right? [...] having a family, having de-pendents who can’t support themselves, [...] medical conditions [andgiven this] you kind of are able to talk yourself into, hey, [...] I don’treally have a choice.” (I2) When asked about anything that made it harder to act, survey respondents echoed this: “The need to providea living for me and my family, together with high prices” (S82), “Re-liance on the job to survive” (S8), and simply: “Money.” (S77) Survey respondents also cited financial stability making it easier to act: “I was single, didn’t have a lot of debt” (S20),“I had a decent savings and could afford to drop the client.” (S62) One interviewee describeda stark example: “aside from [the ethical concern...] my father ha dpassed, and so I got some life insurance money [...] so I didn’t necessarily need the paycheck anymore.” (I21) Support networks mitigate precarity: “[My parents] said [...] they would help [me not] get put out on the street.” (I10), but so does lacking dependents to support:“I’m only supporting myself.” (I11) Precarity from employment-based immigration visas (e.g., USH1B visas [21]) also influenced whether practitioners decide to takeaction, one interviewee making clear he would only ever leave a job if he had another opportunity lined up. He said a semi-permanentstate of precarity leaves immigrants less freedom act on their ethicalscruples: “Indians on H1Bs [often] need to find something [a job]within a very short period of time or actually have to leave the country.And when that happens, you end up taking whatever is available.” (I2) Practitioners were also worried about blacklisting, as one stated fear over “getting [...] bad recommendations from former employers.”(I10) One interviewee described being blacklisted after raising anethics concern: “[the director] sort of ended it with like [...] I can’tfire you. Because you’re in contract. But like, know this: the aid sectoris small. And your career here is like pretty much over.” (I9)5.2 Workplace CultureRespondents described how their organization’s culture – includingnorms, expected practices, and communication styles – affectedtheir willingness to raise concerns. For example, participants cited “trust and respect [and] a common goal” (S71) and an “‘Open door’policy [...] easy to get 1-on-1 time with execs” (S52) as things that made it easier to act on concerns. However, more respondents described “hostile” (S72), “authoritarian/passive aggressive management style[...] hierarchical culture” (S110), “suggestions from higher-ups that ethics discussions were a waste of time.” (S52) as things making itmore difficult to act on their concerns. Interviewees expanded on this, one (I10) contrasted his two consulting experiences: the first where he worked in cubicles “in a building full of thousands of people and feel lonely” (I10), and the second where he “had good rapport”and “trusted” his client and therefore felt “safe” to bring up his concerns. However, some participants said “friendly” cultures made it harder to raise concerns. For example, survey respondents recalled that because “The boss was a friendly chap” (S104) or “bonding attempts from the owners” (S68) made it harder to raise concerns. One interviewee said that remote work meant fewer social ties, which made it easier to escalate his concerns: “This remote way of work-ing [...] helped me to create [...] this disconnection with the manager[which] helped me to say [...] I care less about your opinion on this.”(I14)5.3 Organizational Incentives Participants demonstrated an acute awareness of organizational incentives, and used them to reason about their power to act on their ethical concerns. Profit motives lead to ethical concerns, as many survey respondents identified explicitly: “features were imple-mented to earn money by any means necessary” (S69) or “they were selling geolocation data because it’s worth a lot of money.” (S67) One interviewee said that financial struggles lead to “uncomfortable” tradeoffs: “between the choice of closing the business [versus] doingsomething uncomfortable, almost everyone chooses to do something uncomfortable,” (I7) recalling that a previous employer sold user data to advertisers when “scrambling [to find] some new revenue stream?” (I7) As seen in Section 4.2, practitioners couched ethicalconcerns within organizational incentives to gain support. Consequently, one interviewee described how “ethics wins” were not about an “ethical concern, but a marketing concern, to be honest. And the way that incentives align.” (I2)Other practitioners suggested that it is easier to resolve ethics concerns at government agencies and nonprofits, as one interviewee who had recently transitioned into public service described: “you’re pursuing your goods beyond profit, right? [...] versus ‘we want tomake money’.” (I5) One interviewee doing software engineering at a public university described how state funding shaped project priorities, at least in the ideal: “If the companies paid us, I guess the situation would have been a bit different. But we [wanted] to workin the best interest of the people [...] we are paid by the people’s taxmoney.” (I20), but another academic described how pressures to publish led to his concerns about research integrity. Multiple contractors and consultants described needing to com-promise ethics to appease clients. One interviewee who resigned from a consulting project after being asked to do something illegal said: “Your interactions with the client weigh very heavily on future decisions for future engagements and contracts. So there’s a lot of pressure [...] to get along with the client.

In this section, we discuss personal and organizational factors which affect practitioners’ ability to see their concerns satisfactorily resolved, including financial and immigration precarity, company culture, and organizational incentives.5.1 Financial and Immigration PrecarityWhile some software engineers felt comfortable turning down jobs(Sec. 4.4) or quitting their current jobs (Sec. 4.3) over ethical con-cerns, many practitioners expressed financial limitations on their power to act on their concerns. One explained how concerns overprecarity took priority over ethics: “Any kind of precarity will makeyour weigh your ethics less, right? [...] having a family, having de-pendents who can’t support themselves, [...] medical conditions [andgiven this] you kind of are able to talk yourself into, hey, [...] I don’treally have a choice.” (I2) When asked about anything that made it harder to act, survey respondents echoed this: “The need to providea living for me and my family, together with high prices” (S82), “Re-liance on the job to survive” (S8), and simply: “Money.” (S77) Survey respondents also cited financial stability making it easier to act: “I was single, didn’t have a lot of debt” (S20),“I had a decent savings and could afford to drop the client.” (S62) One interviewee describeda stark example: “aside from [the ethical concern...] my father ha dpassed, and so I got some life insurance money [...] so I didn’t necessarily need the paycheck anymore.” (I21) Support networks mitigate precarity: “[My parents] said [...] they would help [me not] get put out on the street.” (I10), but so does lacking dependents to support:“I’m only supporting myself.” (I11) Precarity from employment-based immigration visas (e.g., USH1B visas [21]) also influenced whether practitioners decide to takeaction, one interviewee making clear he would only ever leave a job if he had another opportunity lined up. He said a semi-permanentstate of precarity leaves immigrants less freedom act on their ethicalscruples: “Indians on H1Bs [often] need to find something [a job]within a very short period of time or actually have to leave the country.And when that happens, you end up taking whatever is available.” (I2) Practitioners were also worried about blacklisting, as one stated fear over “getting [...] bad recommendations from former employers.”(I10) One interviewee described being blacklisted after raising anethics concern: “[the director] sort of ended it with like [...] I can’tfire you. Because you’re in contract. But like, know this: the aid sectoris small. And your career here is like pretty much over.” (I9)5.2 Workplace CultureRespondents described how their organization’s culture – includingnorms, expected practices, and communication styles – affectedtheir willingness to raise concerns. For example, participants cited “trust and respect [and] a common goal” (S71) and an “‘Open door’policy [...] easy to get 1-on-1 time with execs” (S52) as things that made it easier to act on concerns. However, more respondents described “hostile” (S72), “authoritarian/passive aggressive management style[...] hierarchical culture” (S110), “suggestions from higher-ups that ethics discussions were a waste of time.” (S52) as things making itmore difficult to act on their concerns. Interviewees expanded on this, one (I10) contrasted his two consulting experiences: the first where he worked in cubicles “in a building full of thousands of people and feel lonely” (I10), and the second where he “had good rapport”and “trusted” his client and therefore felt “safe” to bring up his concerns. However, some participants said “friendly” cultures made it harder to raise concerns. For example, survey respondents recalled that because “The boss was a friendly chap” (S104) or “bonding attempts from the owners” (S68) made it harder to raise concerns. One interviewee said that remote work meant fewer social ties, which made it easier to escalate his concerns: “This remote way of work-ing [...] helped me to create [...] this disconnection with the manager[which] helped me to say [...] I care less about your opinion on this.”(I14)5.3 Organizational Incentives Participants demonstrated an acute awareness of organizational incentives, and used them to reason about their power to act on their ethical concerns. Profit motives lead to ethical concerns, as many survey respondents identified explicitly: “features were imple-mented to earn money by any means necessary” (S69) or “they were selling geolocation data because it’s worth a lot of money.” (S67) One interviewee said that financial struggles lead to “uncomfortable” tradeoffs: “between the choice of closing the business [versus] doingsomething uncomfortable, almost everyone chooses to do something uncomfortable,” (I7) recalling that a previous employer sold user data to advertisers when “scrambling [to find] some new revenue stream?” (I7) As seen in Section 4.2, practitioners couched ethicalconcerns within organizational incentives to gain support. Consequently, one interviewee described how “ethics wins” were not about an “ethical concern, but a marketing concern, to be honest. And the way that incentives align.” (I2)Other practitioners suggested that it is easier to resolve ethics concerns at government agencies and nonprofits, as one interviewee who had recently transitioned into public service described: “you’re pursuing your goods beyond profit, right? [...] versus ‘we want tomake money’.” (I5) One interviewee doing software engineering at a public university described how state funding shaped project priorities, at least in the ideal: “If the companies paid us, I guess the situation would have been a bit different. But we [wanted] to workin the best interest of the people [...] we are paid by the people’s taxmoney.” (I20), but another academic described how pressures to publish led to his concerns about research integrity. Multiple contractors and consultants described needing to com-promise ethics to appease clients. One interviewee who resigned from a consulting project after being asked to do something illegal said: “Your interactions with the client weigh very heavily on future decisions for future engagements and contracts. So there’s a lot of pressure [...] to get along with the client. [...] If your client asks you to do something you don’t want to do, too bad.” (I12) This appeared especially pronounced at financially precarious firms who felt the need to “act on clients’ whim[s]” (I71) , or non-profits who feel ac-countable to donors rather than beneficiaries, where donors may instead have less beneficent geopolitical interests: “the goals of the[project], are largely to keep refugees [...] in the Middle East.

In this section, we discuss personal and organizational factors which affect practitioners’ ability to see their concerns satisfactorily resolved, including financial and immigration precarity, company culture, and organizational incentives.5.1 Financial and Immigration PrecarityWhile some software engineers felt comfortable turning down jobs(Sec. 4.4) or quitting their current jobs (Sec. 4.3) over ethical con-cerns, many practitioners expressed financial limitations on their power to act on their concerns. One explained how concerns overprecarity took priority over ethics: “Any kind of precarity will makeyour weigh your ethics less, right? [...] having a family, having de-pendents who can’t support themselves, [...] medical conditions [andgiven this] you kind of are able to talk yourself into, hey, [...] I don’treally have a choice.” (I2) When asked about anything that made it harder to act, survey respondents echoed this: “The need to providea living for me and my family, together with high prices” (S82), “Re-liance on the job to survive” (S8), and simply: “Money.” (S77) Survey respondents also cited financial stability making it easier to act: “I was single, didn’t have a lot of debt” (S20),“I had a decent savings and could afford to drop the client.” (S62) One interviewee describeda stark example: “aside from [the ethical concern...] my father ha dpassed, and so I got some life insurance money [...] so I didn’t necessarily need the paycheck anymore.” (I21) Support networks mitigate precarity: “[My parents] said [...] they would help [me not] get put out on the street.” (I10), but so does lacking dependents to support:“I’m only supporting myself.” (I11) Precarity from employment-based immigration visas (e.g., USH1B visas [21]) also influenced whether practitioners decide to takeaction, one interviewee making clear he would only ever leave a job if he had another opportunity lined up. He said a semi-permanentstate of precarity leaves immigrants less freedom act on their ethicalscruples: “Indians on H1Bs [often] need to find something [a job]within a very short period of time or actually have to leave the country.And when that happens, you end up taking whatever is available.” (I2) Practitioners were also worried about blacklisting, as one stated fear over “getting [...] bad recommendations from former employers.”(I10) One interviewee described being blacklisted after raising anethics concern: “[the director] sort of ended it with like [...] I can’tfire you. Because you’re in contract. But like, know this: the aid sectoris small. And your career here is like pretty much over.” (I9)5.2 Workplace CultureRespondents described how their organization’s culture – includingnorms, expected practices, and communication styles – affectedtheir willingness to raise concerns. For example, participants cited “trust and respect [and] a common goal” (S71) and an “‘Open door’policy [...] easy to get 1-on-1 time with execs” (S52) as things that made it easier to act on concerns. However, more respondents described “hostile” (S72), “authoritarian/passive aggressive management style[...] hierarchical culture” (S110), “suggestions from higher-ups that ethics discussions were a waste of time.” (S52) as things making itmore difficult to act on their concerns. Interviewees expanded on this, one (I10) contrasted his two consulting experiences: the first where he worked in cubicles “in a building full of thousands of people and feel lonely” (I10), and the second where he “had good rapport”and “trusted” his client and therefore felt “safe” to bring up his concerns. However, some participants said “friendly” cultures made it harder to raise concerns. For example, survey respondents recalled that because “The boss was a friendly chap” (S104) or “bonding attempts from the owners” (S68) made it harder to raise concerns. One interviewee said that remote work meant fewer social ties, which made it easier to escalate his concerns: “This remote way of work-ing [...] helped me to create [...] this disconnection with the manager[which] helped me to say [...] I care less about your opinion on this.”(I14)5.3 Organizational Incentives Participants demonstrated an acute awareness of organizational incentives, and used them to reason about their power to act on their ethical concerns. Profit motives lead to ethical concerns, as many survey respondents identified explicitly: “features were imple-mented to earn money by any means necessary” (S69) or “they were selling geolocation data because it’s worth a lot of money.” (S67) One interviewee said that financial struggles lead to “uncomfortable” tradeoffs: “between the choice of closing the business [versus] doingsomething uncomfortable, almost everyone chooses to do something uncomfortable,” (I7) recalling that a previous employer sold user data to advertisers when “scrambling [to find] some new revenue stream?” (I7) As seen in Section 4.2, practitioners couched ethicalconcerns within organizational incentives to gain support. Consequently, one interviewee described how “ethics wins” were not about an “ethical concern, but a marketing concern, to be honest. And the way that incentives align.” (I2)Other practitioners suggested that it is easier to resolve ethics concerns at government agencies and nonprofits, as one interviewee who had recently transitioned into public service described: “you’re pursuing your goods beyond profit, right? [...] versus ‘we want tomake money’.” (I5) One interviewee doing software engineering at a public university described how state funding shaped project priorities, at least in the ideal: “If the companies paid us, I guess the situation would have been a bit different. But we [wanted] to workin the best interest of the people [...] we are paid by the people’s taxmoney.” (I20), but another academic described how pressures to publish led to his concerns about research integrity. Multiple contractors and consultants described needing to com-promise ethics to appease clients. One interviewee who resigned from a consulting project after being asked to do something illegal said: “Your interactions with the client weigh very heavily on future decisions for future engagements and contracts. So there’s a lot of pressure [...] to get along with the client. [...] If your client asks you to do something you don’t want to do, too bad.” (I12) This appeared especially pronounced at financially precarious firms who felt the need to “act on clients’ whim[s]” (I71) , or non-profits who feel ac-countable to donors rather than beneficiaries, where donors may instead have less beneficent geopolitical interests: “the goals of the[project], are largely to keep refugees [...] in the Middle East.

In this section, we discuss personal and organizational factors which affect practitioners’ ability to see their concerns satisfactorily resolved, including financial and immigration precarity, company culture, and organizational incentives.5.1 Financial and Immigration PrecarityWhile some software engineers felt comfortable turning down jobs(Sec. 4.4) or quitting their current jobs (Sec. 4.3) over ethical con-cerns, many practitioners expressed financial limitations on their power to act on their concerns. One explained how concerns overprecarity took priority over ethics: “Any kind of precarity will makeyour weigh your ethics less, right? [...] having a family, having de-pendents who can’t support themselves, [...] medical conditions [andgiven this] you kind of are able to talk yourself into, hey, [...] I don’treally have a choice.” (I2) When asked about anything that made it harder to act, survey respondents echoed this: “The need to providea living for me and my family, together with high prices” (S82), “Re-liance on the job to survive” (S8), and simply: “Money.” (S77) Survey respondents also cited financial stability making it easier to act: “I was single, didn’t have a lot of debt” (S20),“I had a decent savings and could afford to drop the client.” (S62) One interviewee describeda stark example: “aside from [the ethical concern...] my father ha dpassed, and so I got some life insurance money [...] so I didn’t necessarily need the paycheck anymore.” (I21) Support networks mitigate precarity: “[My parents] said [...] they would help [me not] get put out on the street.” (I10), but so does lacking dependents to support:“I’m only supporting myself.” (I11) Precarity from employment-based immigration visas (e.g., USH1B visas [21]) also influenced whether practitioners decide to takeaction, one interviewee making clear he would only ever leave a job if he had another opportunity lined up. He said a semi-permanentstate of precarity leaves immigrants less freedom act on their ethicalscruples: “Indians on H1Bs [often] need to find something [a job]within a very short period of time or actually have to leave the country.And when that happens, you end up taking whatever is available.” (I2) Practitioners were also worried about blacklisting, as one stated fear over “getting [...] bad recommendations from former employers.”(I10) One interviewee described being blacklisted after raising anethics concern: “[the director] sort of ended it with like [...] I can’tfire you. Because you’re in contract. But like, know this: the aid sectoris small. And your career here is like pretty much over.” (I9)5.2 Workplace CultureRespondents described how their organization’s culture – includingnorms, expected practices, and communication styles – affectedtheir willingness to raise concerns. For example, participants cited “trust and respect [and] a common goal” (S71) and an “‘Open door’policy [...] easy to get 1-on-1 time with execs” (S52) as things that made it easier to act on concerns. However, more respondents described “hostile” (S72), “authoritarian/passive aggressive management style[...] hierarchical culture” (S110), “suggestions from higher-ups that ethics discussions were a waste of time.” (S52) as things making itmore difficult to act on their concerns. Interviewees expanded on this, one (I10) contrasted his two consulting experiences: the first where he worked in cubicles “in a building full of thousands of people and feel lonely” (I10), and the second where he “had good rapport”and “trusted” his client and therefore felt “safe” to bring up his concerns. However, some participants said “friendly” cultures made it harder to raise concerns. For example, survey respondents recalled that because “The boss was a friendly chap” (S104) or “bonding attempts from the owners” (S68) made it harder to raise concerns. One interviewee said that remote work meant fewer social ties, which made it easier to escalate his concerns: “This remote way of work-ing [...] helped me to create [...] this disconnection with the manager[which] helped me to say [...] I care less about your opinion on this.”(I14)5.3 Organizational Incentives Participants demonstrated an acute awareness of organizational incentives, and used them to reason about their power to act on their ethical concerns. Profit motives lead to ethical concerns, as many survey respondents identified explicitly: “features were imple-mented to earn money by any means necessary” (S69) or “they were selling geolocation data because it’s worth a lot of money.” (S67) One interviewee said that financial struggles lead to “uncomfortable” tradeoffs: “between the choice of closing the business [versus] doingsomething uncomfortable, almost everyone chooses to do something uncomfortable,” (I7) recalling that a previous employer sold user data to advertisers when “scrambling [to find] some new revenue stream?” (I7) As seen in Section 4.2, practitioners couched ethicalconcerns within organizational incentives to gain support. Consequently, one interviewee described how “ethics wins” were not about an “ethical concern, but a marketing concern, to be honest. And the way that incentives align.” (I2)Other practitioners suggested that it is easier to resolve ethics concerns at government agencies and nonprofits, as one interviewee who had recently transitioned into public service described: “you’re pursuing your goods beyond profit, right? [...] versus ‘we want tomake money’.” (I5) One interviewee doing software engineering at a public university described how state funding shaped project priorities, at least in the ideal: “If the companies paid us, I guess the situation would have been a bit different. But we [wanted] to workin the best interest of the people [...] we are paid by the people’s taxmoney.” (I20), but another academic described how pressures to publish led to his concerns about research integrity. Multiple contractors and consultants described needing to com-promise ethics to appease clients. One interviewee who resigned from a consulting project after being asked to do something illegal said: “Your interactions with the client weigh very heavily on future decisions for future engagements and contracts. So there’s a lot of pressure [...] to get along with the client. [...] If your client asks you to do something you don’t want to do, too bad.” (I12) This appeared especially pronounced at financially precarious firms who felt the need to “act on clients’ whim[s]” (I71) , or non-profits who feel ac-countable to donors rather than beneficiaries, where donors may instead have less beneficent geopolitical interests: “the goals of the[project], are largely to keep refugees [...] in the Middle East.
