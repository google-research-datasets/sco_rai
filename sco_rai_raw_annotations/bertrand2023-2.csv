9,Researchers,Agent,"As AI systems gain performance, their adoption expands to areas considered critical. In finance, increasingly sophisticated recommender systems known as “roboadvisors” are democratizing online underwriting of life insurance. In France, where the study was conducted, life insurance is a savings vehicle used both to pass on money to a designated beneficiary upon the death of the subscriber of the contract, and to make a long term financial investment in a tax-advantaged environment. In the rest of the paper, we will only address the latter, most common usage of life-insurance. Life insurance subscribers are presented with a financial recommendation with a specific level of risk (a higher level of risk means more chances to win big but also more chances to lose). Choosing a life insurance contract with an appropriate risk level—not too high for the client’s financial situation—is crucial to ensuring clients’ financial stability. However, many clients may not be financially literate. Therefore, French and European legislation require insurance providers to produce “clear, precise and non-misleading” explanations to guide potential customers towards an “informed” decision and address the asymmetry of information between client and advisor [...] We conducted interviews with 11 participants: 6 consumer protection experts3 and 5 end-users. Theconsumer protection experts were volunteers from the consumer protection section of the French regulator of banking and insurance services with whom we collaborated during this study. We refer to them below with the term “regulator”. All participants had strong experience in auditing insurance providers (from 3 to more than 10 years). Their expertise and role is to verify that insurers respect “the rules intended to ensure the protection of the customers” as well as the “adequacy of the means and procedures which they implement for this purpose” and to promote fair commercial practices among industrial professionals. Half of them had some experience in reviewing robo-advisors. We conducted an inductive content analysis of the detailed notes taken by one author during the interviews with regulators and end-users. One author identified concepts and themes about the characteristics of the explanations that emerged from reading the interview notes. First, the author observed that participants talked mainly about either the explanation implementation or the explanation’s purpose (notably with discussion around risk). On this basis, different themes for either explanations’ for-mat/content or explanations’ purpose could be derived that encom-pass most of the concepts mentioned by participants. The transla-tion from French to English was done after the final categorization. We grouped the main identified themes of the explanation requirements according to their connection to the format or content of the explanation. Through the regulator’s view, we were able to gather domain perspectives that end users alone would not necessarily have provided, such as understanding the interests of different stakeholders and potential misalignment, where the vulnerability of certain users can be exploited, or the wide range of best prac-tices seen for recommendations and explanations. Conversely, the end-users’ perspective reminds us of what clients truly care about,regardless of existing regulations. While the main focus of the reg-ulators was on the notion of risk, the main concern of the users was not as clear. For some, it was the performance of the proposed contract, for others the reliability of the robo-advisor, and for others still, the risk.Understanding explanations’ purposes through two perspectives.The regulators reported an increasing trend for automated online robo-advisors, and a lack of “good” automated explanations to support those tools. Current robo-advisors’ explanations were seen as very “generic” and “nebulous” in general. One of the reasons is the use by many brokers of a third-party software to produce explanations and recommendations, over which they have little control. regulators also Reported the difficulty for brokers to produce explanations with the increasing complexity of their tools: “There’s too much complexity even for them.” This highlights the relevance of the XAI domain to help solve real-world problems,even when the underlying recommendation system is AI but rule-based. The regulators insisted on the importance of explanations as a safeguard to inform customers about risk, taking as an example cases of overestimation of the risk for vulnerable people. Although we could group both regulator and end-user perspectives into com-mon themes, some themes were discussed more by one group. For example, end-users expressed their need to be engaged—some felt either overwhelmed or bored by the topic. regulators talked about the need for complete information although end-users insisted on their need for simple, easy-to-digest information.Placing the cursor between text and graphics. One of the themes we found was the need for schematic explanations on the one hand and the need for more human explanations that can answer a wide range of users’ questions on the other. Two regulators very much appreciated our graphical, Shapley-based explanations, finding they had never seen something like that in the market and that it responded well to the need to link users’ characteristics to the recommended product. However, many—regulators and end-users alike—indicated their need to be able to chat with a human counsellor despite the explanation. A regulator also imagined explanations could look more like a Frequently Asked Questions menu and  a participant said “I can imagine a chatbot with someone behind it who can answer my questions.” This led us to compare more “conversational” or more “graphical” explanations in the next study.",945-7,We,

In finance, increasingly sophisticated recommender systems known as “roboadvisors” are democratizing online underwriting of life insurance. In France, where the study was conducted, life insurance is a savings vehicle used both to pass on money to a designated beneficiary upon the death of the subscriber of the contract, and to make a long term financial investment in a tax-advantaged environment. In the rest of the paper, we will only address the latter, most common usage of life-insurance. Life insurance subscribers are presented with a financial recommendation with a specific level of risk (a higher level of risk means more chances to win big but also more chances to lose). Choosing a life insurance contract with an appropriate risk level—not too high for the client’s financial situation—is crucial to ensuring clients’ financial stability. However, many clients may not be financially literate. Therefore, French and European legislation require insurance providers to produce “clear, precise and non-misleading” explanations to guide potential customers towards an “informed” decision and address the asymmetry of information between client and advisor [...] We conducted interviews with 11 participants: 6 consumer protection experts3 and 5 end-users. Theconsumer protection experts were volunteers from the consumer protection section of the French regulator of banking and insurance services with whom we collaborated during this study. We refer to them below with the term “regulator”. All participants had strong experience in auditing insurance providers (from 3 to more than 10 years). Their expertise and role is to verify that insurers respect “the rules intended to ensure the protection of the customers” as well as the “adequacy of the means and procedures which they implement for this purpose” and to promote fair commercial practices among industrial professionals. Half of them had some experience in reviewing robo-advisors. We conducted an inductive content analysis of the detailed notes taken by one author during the interviews with regulators and end-users. One author identified concepts and themes about the characteristics of the explanations that emerged from reading the interview notes. First, the author observed that participants talked mainly about either the explanation implementation or the explanation’s purpose (notably with discussion around risk). On this basis, different themes for either explanations’ for-mat/content or explanations’ purpose could be derived that encom-pass most of the concepts mentioned by participants. The transla-tion from French to English was done after the final categorization. We grouped the main identified themes of the explanation requirements according to their connection to the format or content of the explanation. Through the regulator’s view, we were able to gather domain perspectives that end users alone would not necessarily have provided, such as understanding the interests of different stakeholders and potential misalignment, where the vulnerability of certain users can be exploited, or the wide range of best prac-tices seen for recommendations and explanations. Conversely, the end-users’ perspective reminds us of what clients truly care about,regardless of existing regulations.

In finance, increasingly sophisticated recommender systems known as “roboadvisors” are democratizing online underwriting of life insurance. In France, where the study was conducted, life insurance is a savings vehicle used both to pass on money to a designated beneficiary upon the death of the subscriber of the contract, and to make a long term financial investment in a tax-advantaged environment. In the rest of the paper, we will only address the latter, most common usage of life-insurance. Life insurance subscribers are presented with a financial recommendation with a specific level of risk (a higher level of risk means more chances to win big but also more chances to lose). Choosing a life insurance contract with an appropriate risk level—not too high for the client’s financial situation—is crucial to ensuring clients’ financial stability. However, many clients may not be financially literate. Therefore, French and European legislation require insurance providers to produce “clear, precise and non-misleading” explanations to guide potential customers towards an “informed” decision and address the asymmetry of information between client and advisor [...] We conducted interviews with 11 participants: 6 consumer protection experts3 and 5 end-users. Theconsumer protection experts were volunteers from the consumer protection section of the French regulator of banking and insurance services with whom we collaborated during this study. We refer to them below with the term “regulator”. All participants had strong experience in auditing insurance providers (from 3 to more than 10 years). Their expertise and role is to verify that insurers respect “the rules intended to ensure the protection of the customers” as well as the “adequacy of the means and procedures which they implement for this purpose” and to promote fair commercial practices among industrial professionals. Half of them had some experience in reviewing robo-advisors. We conducted an inductive content analysis of the detailed notes taken by one author during the interviews with regulators and end-users. One author identified concepts and themes about the characteristics of the explanations that emerged from reading the interview notes. First, the author observed that participants talked mainly about either the explanation implementation or the explanation’s purpose (notably with discussion around risk). On this basis, different themes for either explanations’ for-mat/content or explanations’ purpose could be derived that encom-pass most of the concepts mentioned by participants. The transla-tion from French to English was done after the final categorization. We grouped the main identified themes of the explanation requirements according to their connection to the format or content of the explanation. Through the regulator’s view, we were able to gather domain perspectives that end users alone would not necessarily have provided, such as understanding the interests of different stakeholders and potential misalignment, where the vulnerability of certain users can be exploited, or the wide range of best prac-tices seen for recommendations and explanations.

Choosing a life insurance contract with an appropriate risk level—not too high for the client’s financial situation—is crucial to ensuring clients’ financial stability. However, many clients may not be financially literate. Therefore, French and European legislation require insurance providers to produce “clear, precise and non-misleading” explanations to guide potential customers towards an “informed” decision and address the asymmetry of information between client and advisor [...] We conducted interviews with 11 participants: 6 consumer protection experts3 and 5 end-users. Theconsumer protection experts were volunteers from the consumer protection section of the French regulator of banking and insurance services with whom we collaborated during this study. We refer to them below with the term “regulator”. All participants had strong experience in auditing insurance providers (from 3 to more than 10 years). Their expertise and role is to verify that insurers respect “the rules intended to ensure the protection of the customers” as well as the “adequacy of the means and procedures which they implement for this purpose” and to promote fair commercial practices among industrial professionals. Half of them had some experience in reviewing robo-advisors. We conducted an inductive content analysis of the detailed notes taken by one author during the interviews with regulators and end-users. One author identified concepts and themes about the characteristics of the explanations that emerged from reading the interview notes. First, the author observed that participants talked mainly about either the explanation implementation or the explanation’s purpose (notably with discussion around risk). On this basis, different themes for either explanations’ for-mat/content or explanations’ purpose could be derived that encom-pass most of the concepts mentioned by participants. The transla-tion from French to English was done after the final categorization. We grouped the main identified themes of the explanation requirements according to their connection to the format or content of the explanation. Through the regulator’s view, we were able to gather domain perspectives that end users alone would not necessarily have provided, such as understanding the interests of different stakeholders and potential misalignment, where the vulnerability of certain users can be exploited, or the wide range of best prac-tices seen for recommendations and explanations. Conversely, the end-users’ perspective reminds us of what clients truly care about,regardless of existing regulations. While the main focus of the reg-ulators was on the notion of risk, the main concern of the users was not as clear. For some, it was the performance of the proposed contract, for others the reliability of the robo-advisor, and for others still, the risk.Understanding explanations’ purposes through two perspectives.The regulators reported an increasing trend for automated online robo-advisors, and a lack of “good” automated explanations to support those tools. Current robo-advisors’ explanations were seen as very “generic” and “nebulous” in general. One of the reasons is the use by many brokers of a third-party software to produce explanations and recommendations, over which they have little control. regulators also Reported the difficulty for brokers to produce explanations with the increasing complexity of their tools: “There’s too much complexity even for them.” This highlights the relevance of the XAI domain to help solve real-world problems,even when the underlying recommendation system is AI but rule-based. The regulators insisted on the importance of explanations as a safeguard to inform customers about risk, taking as an example cases of overestimation of the risk for vulnerable people. Although we could group both regulator and end-user perspectives into com-mon themes, some themes were discussed more by one group. For example, end-users expressed their need to be engaged—some felt either overwhelmed or bored by the topic. regulators talked about the need for complete information although end-users insisted on their need for simple, easy-to-digest information.Placing the cursor between text and graphics. One of the themes we found was the need for schematic explanations on the one hand and the need for more human explanations that can answer a wide range of users’ questions on the other. Two regulators very much appreciated our graphical, Shapley-based explanations, finding they had never seen something like that in the market and that it responded well to the need to link users’ characteristics to the recommended product. However, many—regulators and end-users alike—indicated their need to be able to chat with a human counsellor despite the explanation. A regulator also imagined explanations could look more like a Frequently Asked Questions menu and  a participant said “I can imagine a chatbot with someone behind it who can answer my questions.” This led us to compare more “conversational” or more “graphical” explanations in the next study.",945-7,"egulators very much appreciated our graphical, Shapley-based explanations, finding they had never seen something like that in the market and that it responded well to the need to link users’ characteristics to the recommended product."
