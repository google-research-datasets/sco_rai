9,TechnologyUsers,Agent,"Technology users generate large troves of data in their daily interactions with computing systems, e.g. behavior logs, content, and personal information. Currently, this data primarily benefits just a small set of technology organizations that are equipped with the means and resources to collect, process, and model data at scale for their own benefits (e.g. insights, models, sales of services and advertisements). For example, publicly available texts and artwork enabled the creation of generative AI models like ChatGPT and Dall-E because model developers were able to scrape and process data from billions of web pages 1. Conversely, data producers like artists,writers, and users have little to no power in deciding how their data is used or who it benefits [4, 7, 42, 63]. This power imbalance between data producers and technology operators has manifested in public outcries about industry practices in the tech sector. For example, emerging generative AI models such as Stable Diffusion, Dall-E,and GitHub Copilot have sparked extensive criticism among artists and programmers because of these models’ unapproved reuse of their work and implications on future employment opportunities[79–81]. More broadly, social media users have long protested the monetization of user data and the corporate surveillance practices that tend to go with it [45].Given data producers’ lack of power over the data they generate, researchers, policymakers, and activists have advocated for a new producer-oriented paradigm shift to increase the voice of the data-generating public – understanding data generation as a form of labor, or “data labor” [7]. Supporters of this approach have argued that treating data as an outcome of social labor instead of “exhaust” will pave the way for more broadly distributing the power and benefits of data [86], and scholars have addressed what this may look like in practice. Initial (yet abstract) proposals include supporting “data unions” [63] or “mediators of individual data” [42]that negotiate data use terms with technology firms on behalf of their data-producing ”union“ members [63], drafting legislation that would grant users greater control over the data they produce[1, 76], and creating tools to support user-driven collective action[20, 86].
