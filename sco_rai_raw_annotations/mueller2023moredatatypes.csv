9,DBDPs,Agent,"Data brokers and data processors (DBDPs) form a multi-billion-dollar industry that collects, buys, and sells personally identifiable information (PII) from individuals worldwide. According to the market research company eMarketer, the size of the data broker industry was approximately 300 billion dollars in 2020. They have also recently projected the industry’s size to nearly double within three years. [17]Even with new legislation emerging in the U.S. and the E.U. The data broker industry lacks sufficient transparency and regulation. Moreover, many data processors may not be officially listed by definition as data brokers on any U.S. state registry, even though they play a significant role in collecting, processing, and sharing(often for monetary gain) data that they collect from consumers. It is important to note that many data processors do not sell raw data but rather generate income by serving as a data pass-through selling insights or using the data to generate income from advertising revenue. [12] According to the Vermont Data Broker Act of 2018, a data broker is defined as “a business, or unit or units of a business,separately or together, that knowingly collects and sells or licenses to third parties the brokered personal information of a consumer with whom the business does not have a direct relationship.” [24]For example, Facebook may not be considered a data broker definition. However, it is one of the largest data processors in the world and benefits financially from the data assets they collect from social media users. For the purposes of our project, we will consider both data brokers and data processors (we will collectively call them DBDPs) because both significantly impact the risks and potential harms to data subjects (individuals whose data is collected by DBDPs) associated with collecting personal data.Lack of transparency and information about the DBDP industry[5] is a significant hurdle in assessing the harms associated with collecting PII. For our purposes, we are primarily concerned with harm to U.S. data subjects.There are several issues related to the lack of transparency in the DBDP industry, namely: (1) It is difficult to properly assess the magnitude and impact of harm to data subjects because it is currently unknown how much data and what data types have been collected by DBDPs over time; (2) There is little to no mandatory financial reporting for the DBDP industry, so the market value of the data they collect and sell is unknown which makes it difficult to assess damages and loss; (3) Finally, it is difficult to track which third parties have been granted access to PII data by DBDPs and track the flow of information that is shared. Moreover, many DBDPs function under the justification that PII data is collected with sufficient consent from individuals. However,the legitimacy of this consent is a concern, particularly considering the necessary criteria for informed consent and the issue of group consent for data that implicates social groups. [20]The legitimacy of individual informed consent is dependent on(1) the data subject understanding the agreement; (2) entering into it without coercion; (3) entering the agreement intentionally and deliberately; (4) and the agreement authorizing a specific course of action for the data being collected. [30] If DBDPs were to follow the individual informed consent criteria, particularly for criteria 4, they would need a mechanism for the data subject to track the status of their data to assess if the consent agreement was being upheld.However, there is currently no way in the U.S. to track your PIIdata and fully understand how it is being processed and shared byDBDPs. Information asymmetry between DBDPs and data subject makes it challenging for data subjects to follow their data, know what types of data are being collected, used, and shared, and holdfirms accountable if data are being processed against the terms of their original consent agreement or the law.Transparency will remain an issue until there is transparent mandatory reporting by DBDPs on the data collected, used, andshared, a mechanism for consumers to track their data, and disclo-sure of detailed digital assets by DBDPs (currently, only publicly traded DBDPs need to disclose this information to the Securities And Exchange Commission and data assets are lumped together with all intangible assets like patents and intellectual property). In place of these resolutions, researchers must find other means to infer the activities of DBDPs. Typically, the only reporting required for DBDPs, in the United States includes declaring they are a databroker on a State registry (required by law in states like Vermont[24] and California [23]), and most of these DBDPs also publish a privacy policy on their public website.",1088-9,Data brokers and data processors (DBDPs),

[12] According to the Vermont Data Broker Act of 2018, a data broker is defined as “a business, or unit or units of a business,separately or together, that knowingly collects and sells or licenses to third parties the brokered personal information of a consumer with whom the business does not have a direct relationship.” [24]For example, Facebook may not be considered a data broker definition. However, it is one of the largest data processors in the world and benefits financially from the data assets they collect from social media users.

For our purposes, we are primarily concerned with harm to U.S. data subjects.There are several issues related to the lack of transparency in the DBDP industry, namely: (1) It is difficult to properly assess the magnitude and impact of harm to data subjects because it is currently unknown how much data and what data types have been collected by DBDPs over time; (2) There is little to no mandatory financial reporting for the DBDP industry, so the market value of the data they collect and sell is unknown which makes it difficult to assess damages and loss; (3) Finally, it is difficult to track which third parties have been granted access to PII data by DBDPs and track the flow of information that is shared. Moreover, many DBDPs function under the justification that PII data is collected with sufficient consent from individuals. However,the legitimacy of this consent is a concern, particularly considering the necessary criteria for informed consent and the issue of group consent for data that implicates social groups. [20]The legitimacy of individual informed consent is dependent on(1) the data subject understanding the agreement; (2) entering into it without coercion; (3) entering the agreement intentionally and deliberately; (4) and the agreement authorizing a specific course of action for the data being collected. [30] If DBDPs were to follow the individual informed consent criteria, particularly for criteria 4, they would need a mechanism for the data subject to track the status of their data to assess if the consent agreement was being upheld.However, there is currently no way in the U.S. to track your PIIdata and fully understand how it is being processed and shared byDBDPs. Information asymmetry between DBDPs and data subject makes it challenging for data subjects to follow their data, know what types of data are being collected, used, and shared, and holdfirms accountable if data are being processed against the terms of their original consent agreement or the law.Transparency will remain an issue until there is transparent mandatory reporting by DBDPs on the data collected, used, andshared, a mechanism for consumers to track their data, and disclo-sure of detailed digital assets by DBDPs (currently, only publicly traded DBDPs need to disclose this information to the Securities And Exchange Commission and data assets are lumped together with all intangible assets like patents and intellectual property).

Information asymmetry between DBDPs and data subject makes it challenging for data subjects to follow their data, know what types of data are being collected, used, and shared, and holdfirms accountable if data are being processed against the terms of their original consent agreement or the law.Transparency will remain an issue until there is transparent mandatory reporting by DBDPs on the data collected, used, andshared, a mechanism for consumers to track their data, and disclo-sure of detailed digital assets by DBDPs (currently, only publicly traded DBDPs need to disclose this information to the Securities And Exchange Commission and data assets are lumped together with all intangible assets like patents and intellectual property). In place of these resolutions, researchers must find other means to infer the activities of DBDPs. Typically, the only reporting required for DBDPs, in the United States includes declaring they are a databroker on a State registry (required by law in states like Vermont[24] and California [23]), and most of these DBDPs also publish a privacy policy on their public website.",1088-9,most of these DBDPs also publish a privacy policy on their public website
