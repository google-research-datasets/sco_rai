9,Consolidation,Perceived_Problem,"The dynamics of interdependence and integration mean that algorithmic supply chains are increasingly consolidating around (primarily) Amazon, Microsoft, and Google [22, 24, 93]. Several factors tend towards consolidation, including competitive advantages offered by integration. These companies span markets, offering developers ‘all-in-one’ packages with easy access to state-of-the-art technologies, which readily scale and enable ‘global’ reach. In AI production, they leverage bespoke and advanced computing resources and expertise, significant quantities of data represent-ing real-world deployments and use-cases, and economies of scale across AI and non-AI customer bases. They can therefore offer services at lower cost, broader scale, greater technical sophistica-tion, and with potentially easier access than many competitors. Moreover, their substantial financial resources help consolidate their position through purchases of and investments in potential competitors (such as Google’s purchase of DeepMind [40], or Mi-crosoft’s investment in OpenAI [73]). As a result, major providers are systemically important for the political economy, governance, and accountability of AI. Even where an application does not use a major provider’s AI services (using the developer's own AI technology, for example, or obtaining it from a smaller provider), major providers’ non-AI services may form significant parts of supply chains for either that application or the AI service it uses (or both). These providers are therefore core actors in many supply chains, strategically positioning themselves across markets in a process of enclosure of AI-technological infrastructure and, by extension, of businesses, institutions, organizations, andsectors relying on supply chains involving their services. They are thus positioned in commercially beneficial interdependencies both with other actors in particular supply chains, but also more broadly– a few dominant providers underpin important social and economic processes while themselves depending to various degrees on many actors in social, legal, technological, and political economic processes which help produce and maintain their position.",1191-2,The dynamics of interdependence and integration mean that algorithmic supply chains are increasingly consolidating,
