9,SubjectDomainRepresentaiton,Goal,"The goal of subject-domain representation is not just to be in-clusive for its own sake, but to be instrumentally beneficial – to ensure that the evaluation will surface as many failure modes in the model as possible prior to deployment. Buolamwini and Gebru employ user-representative sampling for the Gender Shades audit dataset, Pilot Parliaments Benchmark (PPB), sampling public images of the faces of public figures in national parliaments the world-over. While this may not perfectly capture all the instances of different types of faces, it ensures there is global representa-tion. The authors then investigate intersectionality (darker-female,lighter-male, darker-male, lighter-female as based on the Fitzpatrick skin tone groupings) and evaluate facial recognition systems per-group.",525,subject-domain representation,
