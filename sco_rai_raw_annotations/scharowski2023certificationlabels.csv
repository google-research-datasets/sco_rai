9,Participants,Agent,"For the purpose of this study, we focus on the topic""attitudes toward certification labels [...] Participants in the survey study were asked to select one case each from the high-stake (medical diagnosis, hiring procedure, loan approval) and one from the low-stake (music preference, route plan-ning, price comparison) scenarios without explicitly being informed of this distinction. Validation of this distinction between low- and high-stake was provided by participants’ ""impactfulness"" rankings. Calculating a mode revealed that the three high-stake scenarios were perceived as the most impactful ones (i.e., 1 = medical diagno-sis, 2 = hiring process, 3 = loan approval, 4 = price comparison, 5 =music preference, 6 = route planning). The majority of participants indicated that they would be more likely to accept the AI’s decision/recommendation in low-risk scenarios (74.2%, 𝑛 = 224) than in high-risk scenarios (17.9%, 𝑛 = 54) and 7.9% (𝑛 = 24) indicating no preference, which we considered an additional confirmation of the distinctiveness of the two scenarios. Participants in the interview study distinguished between low- and high-stakes scenarios primarily on the level of risk associated with the scenario [...] A majority of the survey participants directly indicated that they would prefer the use of a certification label in the selected high-stake scenario (63.2%, 𝑛 = 191), compared to preferring a label in the low-stake scenarios (22.2%, 𝑛 = 67), with 14.6% (𝑛 = 44) of partici-pants indicating no preference. Regarding the different preferences for certification labels in low- and high-stake scenarios, participantsfrom the interview study expressed a greater demand for a certifi-cation label in high-stake scenarios because of the higher scenario complexity, limited individual expertise, and a lack of prior experience with the system. Overall, 81.1% (𝑛 = 245) of survey participantsstated a preference for using an AI with a label, compared to 6%(𝑛 = 18) that would prefer to use an AI without a label and 12.9% (𝑛 = 39) that stated no preference. Also, 70.9% (𝑛 = 214) indicated to be more likely to accept an AI’s decision/recommendation if it had received a label, compared to 14.2% (𝑛 = 43) that indicated ""no,""and 14.9% (𝑛 = 45), that made no statement.

45,NeedforFairness,constrainsAgent,Participants,"For the purpose of this study, we focus on the topic""attitudes toward certification labels [...] Participants in the survey study were asked to select one case each from the high-stake (medical diagnosis, hiring procedure, loan approval) and one from the low-stake (music preference, route plan-ning, price comparison) scenarios without explicitly being informed of this distinction. Validation of this distinction between low- and high-stake was provided by participants’ ""impactfulness"" rankings. Calculating a mode revealed that the three high-stake scenarios were perceived as the most impactful ones (i.e., 1 = medical diagno-sis, 2 = hiring process, 3 = loan approval, 4 = price comparison, 5 =music preference, 6 = route planning). The majority of participants indicated that they would be more likely to accept the AI’s decision/recommendation in low-risk scenarios (74.2%, 𝑛 = 224) than in high-risk scenarios (17.9%, 𝑛 = 54) and 7.9% (𝑛 = 24) indicating no preference, which we considered an additional confirmation of the distinctiveness of the two scenarios. Participants in the interview study distinguished between low- and high-stakes scenarios primarily on the level of risk associated with the scenario [...] A majority of the survey participants directly indicated that they would prefer the use of a certification label in the selected high-stake scenario (63.2%, 𝑛 = 191), compared to preferring a label in the low-stake scenarios (22.2%, 𝑛 = 67), with 14.6% (𝑛 = 44) of partici-pants indicating no preference. Regarding the different preferences for certification labels in low- and high-stake scenarios, participantsfrom the interview study expressed a greater demand for a certifi-cation label in high-stake scenarios because of the higher scenario complexity, limited individual expertise, and a lack of prior experience with the system. Overall, 81.1% (𝑛 = 245) of survey participantsstated a preference for using an AI with a label, compared to 6%(𝑛 = 18) that would prefer to use an AI without a label and 12.9% (𝑛 = 39) that stated no preference.
