9,DollarStreet,Artifact,"Dollar Street [23] is a dataset of geographically-diverse images spanning a broad range of household incomes. We use the labels associated with each image in a 138-class object classification task,where group information is household income quartile. We explicitly rebalance the dataset via subsampling to ensure each group has the same number of data points, though in this experiment, we don’t match the label distributions between groups due to limited data availability for certain group × label pairs. We evaluate model strained on each income quartile independently, and models trained on all quartiles together. We train single-layer FC networks on rep-resentations extracted from ResNet-18 pre trained on ImageNet-1K.See appendix C for details, including discussion on the potentially confounding effects of pretraining. Figure 7a shows the observed (opaque) and estimated (translu-cent) performance disparity between images from households in the lowest (1st) income quartile, compared against other quartiles.As with FairFace, observed disparity consistently exceeds the es-timated disparity, indicating difficulty amplification. In contrast,fig. 6b compares each quartile against the highest (4th) income quar-tile, and presents a mixed picture. Here, the observed performance gap between 1st and 4th is amplified (though to the benefit of the4th quartile, and the detriment of the 1st), whereas the observed disparity between the 4th and the two middle quartiles is slightly at-tenuated. These results again confirm that performance disparities persist in the balanced data setting, and performance disparities may be selectively amplified depending on one’s choice of model.In the case of this Dollar Street example, this selective amplification results in worse-than-expected performance disparities and exces-sively degraded performance on images from the lowest-income households.",361,Dollar Street [23] is a dataset of geographically-diverse images spanning a broad range of household incomes,
