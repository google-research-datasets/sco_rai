9,MPS,Agent,"The second case example places an affordance lens on Massively Parallel Sequencing (MPS), a genetic sequencing instrument with processing capacities exponentially greater than extant methods [78, 79]. Though originating as a medical tool for research and treatment of genetic disease [80],MPS has now been repurposed by law enforcement as a tool of inferential phenotyping [81]. In its carceral application, MPS uses genetic markers to infer biogenetic ancestry, gender, and eye color of a suspect based on DNAfound at a crime scene. MPS is presently utilized by the Australian FederalPolice, whose lead scientist promises near-future developments that expand inferences to include ‘distance between the eyes, eye, nose and ear shape,lip fullness, and cheek structure 2,3.MPS constructs a suspect when one is unknown. It uses nucleotide sequences mapped into genetic data libraries produced through procedures that amplify small amounts of DNA into much larger amounts, treated withML models that transform the data into a set of identifiable traits [80]. Thisprocess generates a suspect pool tied to, and inextricable from, existing groups of surveilled and policed subjects, crystalizing these subjects into targets of distrust and incrimination. MPS has been the subject of public controversy in Australia, including an open letter and petition for a moratorium4. The use of facial classifiers fixes MPS to the logics and practices of racial eugenics and phrenology [83, 84], while its carceral applications join MPS with a battery of algorithmic policing tools that consistently and systematically re-entrench punitive control over minoritized populations[52, 85, 86]. In MPS, we find a technology that requires dismantle. An affordance analysis puts this in clear terms (see Table 4).Articulated through the mechanisms of affordance, MPS demands integration between physical characteristics and character assessment, requesting and encouraging correspondence between physiology and criminality, tied to existing patterns of policing in which suspicion begets criminalization,which begets suspicion and so forth. MPS also discourages contestation and intercession from affected communities, for once criminalization is established, the burden of proof shifts to suspected individuals and to those with now suspicious bodies. Yet the accused and the surveilled lack the cultural and institutional legitimacy to call such decisions into question,nor do most people, including officers, judges, and other criminal-judicial actors, have the dexterity, or skills and knowledge, to interrogate these systems and evaluate their veracity. In Example 1 (data driven warehouse work) we reconfigured the system to align with human-centered goals of dignity, diversity, and autonomy. In contrast, MPS in policing has no space for reimagining, as the analysis lays bare the tool’s fundamentally troubled character.

In its carceral application, MPS uses genetic markers to infer biogenetic ancestry, gender, and eye color of a suspect based on DNAfound at a crime scene. MPS is presently utilized by the Australian FederalPolice, whose lead scientist promises near-future developments that expand inferences to include ‘distance between the eyes, eye, nose and ear shape,lip fullness, and cheek structure 2,3.MPS constructs a suspect when one is unknown. It uses nucleotide sequences mapped into genetic data libraries produced through procedures that amplify small amounts of DNA into much larger amounts, treated withML models that transform the data into a set of identifiable traits [80]. Thisprocess generates a suspect pool tied to, and inextricable from, existing groups of surveilled and policed subjects, crystalizing these subjects into targets of distrust and incrimination. MPS has been the subject of public controversy in Australia, including an open letter and petition for a moratorium4. The use of facial classifiers fixes MPS to the logics and practices of racial eugenics and phrenology [83, 84], while its carceral applications join MPS with a battery of algorithmic policing tools that consistently and systematically re-entrench punitive control over minoritized populations[52, 85, 86]. In MPS, we find a technology that requires dismantle. An affordance analysis puts this in clear terms (see Table 4).Articulated through the mechanisms of affordance, MPS demands integration between physical characteristics and character assessment, requesting and encouraging correspondence between physiology and criminality, tied to existing patterns of policing in which suspicion begets criminalization,which begets suspicion and so forth. MPS also discourages contestation and intercession from affected communities, for once criminalization is established, the burden of proof shifts to suspected individuals and to those with now suspicious bodies. Yet the accused and the surveilled lack the cultural and institutional legitimacy to call such decisions into question,nor do most people, including officers, judges, and other criminal-judicial actors, have the dexterity, or skills and knowledge, to interrogate these systems and evaluate their veracity. In Example 1 (data driven warehouse work) we reconfigured the system to align with human-centered goals of dignity, diversity, and autonomy. In contrast, MPS in policing has no space for reimagining, as the analysis lays bare the tool’s fundamentally troubled character.

36,MPS,influencesPrecept,LackOfContestation,"The second case example places an affordance lens on Massively Parallel Sequencing (MPS), a genetic sequencing instrument with processing capacities exponentially greater than extant methods [78, 79]. Though originating as a medical tool for research and treatment of genetic disease [80],MPS has now been repurposed by law enforcement as a tool of inferential phenotyping [81].
