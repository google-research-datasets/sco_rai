9,P2PLendingPlatform,Artifact,"This paper investigates gender discrimination and its underlying drivers on a prominent Chinese online peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platform. While existing studies on P2P lending focus on disparate treatment (DT), DT narrowly recognizes direct discrimination and overlooks indirect and proxy discrimination, providing an incomplete picture. In this work, we measure a broadened discrimination notion called disparate impact (DI), which encompasses any dispar-ity in the loan’s funding rate that does not commensurate with the actual return rate. We develop a two-stage predictor substitution approach to estimate DI from observational data. Our findings reveal (i) female borrowers, given identical actual return rates, are 3.97% more likely to receive funding, (ii) at least 37.1% of this DIs favoring female is indirect or proxy discrimination, and (iii) DT indeed underestimates the overall female favoritism by 44.6%. How-ever, we also identify the overall female favoritism can be explained by one specific discrimination driver, rational statistical discrim-ination, wherein investors accurately predict the expected return rate from imperfect observations. Furthermore, female borrowers still require 2% higher expected return rate to secure funding, in-dicating another driver taste-based discrimination co-exists andis against female. These results altogether tell a cautionary tale:on one hand, P2P lending provides a valuable alternative credit market where the affirmative action to support female naturally emerges from the rational crowd; on the other hand, while the overall discrimination effect (both in terms of DI or DT) favor female, concerning taste-based discrimination can persist and can be obscured by other coexisting discrimination drivers, such as statistical discrimination [...] P2P Lending as a Market-based Affirmative Action Given The reality that gender gap in financial access still persists [40] and female is still disadvantaged in many other credit markets [29, 31,89], our empirical results suggest online P2P lending provides an alternative credit market where the affirmative action to support female can arise naturally from the rational crowd. We take a liberal interpretation of affirmative action that focuses on the effect of nar-rowing existing inequality but does not imply intentions from the investors and/or the platform, similar to the discussion of market affirmative action in Cooter [37]. Below, we discuss two reasons why P2P lending can be a desirable policy instrument to narrow the gender gap in financial access. First, the affirmative action in P2P lending is driven by market forces, which is arguably more efficient than heavy-handed bureaucratic rules such as quota systems [22, 34]. The P2P lending market functions like a perfectly competitive market because (i) the size of P2P loans is typically small and (ii) there is a large number of investors. Based on standard demand-supply analysis [37], the market competition will impose the cost of gender animus—in the form of lower expected return—upon the investors who demandit. Therefore, competition reduces gender animus. Competition, however, will not eliminate statistical discrimination because itis efficient and reflects rational behavior [75]. Consequently, be-cause females are indeed less likely to default on their P2P loans,the market forces will drive the investors to engage in statistical discrimination that favors female. Second, affirmative action resulted from statistical discrimina-tion leads to an important narrative shift. The female borrowers favorable DI is incentivized by their own higher expected return rates rather than being granted due to their disadvantaged socio-economical status. Particularly, it generates a viable defense to the attack on affirmative action that less qualified female borrowers are selected over more qualified male borrowers [30]. In fact, more qualified female borrowers—in terms of expected return rates—are selected by the investors.On a cautionary note, statistical discrimination by itself is likely to be illegal in many jurisdictions. In order to qualify as affirmativeaction, a practice must be narrowly tailored, not violate the rights of non-protected groups, and meet other legal requirements. Sincewe lack expertise in law, we refrain from delving into the discussion of legality in this paper.Gender Animus Can Still Exist Under Favorable DisparateImpact While our study on disparate impact reveals a larger female favoritism on the collaborated P2P lending platform than disparate treatment, We caution against making overly simplistic or absolute interpretations of the findings. We provide counterevidence that the overall female favoritism can be completely explained as rational statistical discrimination and gender animus against female can still exist. Gender animus does not become right or justified when its effect is obscured by statistical discrimination.The underpinning is different discrimination drivers, such as gen-der taste and statistical discrimination, can coexist and contribute to the overall discrimination. We call for future research that not only tests the existence of discrimination but also identifies the underlying drivers of discrimination, as highlighted by Bohren et al.[27], Hull [59].","775, 783-4",a prominent Chinese online peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platform.,

We take a liberal interpretation of affirmative action that focuses on the effect of nar-rowing existing inequality but does not imply intentions from the investors and/or the platform, similar to the discussion of market affirmative action in Cooter [37]. Below, we discuss two reasons why P2P lending can be a desirable policy instrument to narrow the gender gap in financial access. First, the affirmative action in P2P lending is driven by market forces, which is arguably more efficient than heavy-handed bureaucratic rules such as quota systems [22, 34]. The P2P lending market functions like a perfectly competitive market because (i) the size of P2P loans is typically small and (ii) there is a large number of investors. Based on standard demand-supply analysis [37], the market competition will impose the cost of gender animus—in the form of lower expected return—upon the investors who demandit. Therefore, competition reduces gender animus. Competition, however, will not eliminate statistical discrimination because itis efficient and reflects rational behavior [75]. Consequently, be-cause females are indeed less likely to default on their P2P loans,the market forces will drive the investors to engage in statistical discrimination that favors female. Second, affirmative action resulted from statistical discrimina-tion leads to an important narrative shift. The female borrowers favorable DI is incentivized by their own higher expected return rates rather than being granted due to their disadvantaged socio-economical status. Particularly, it generates a viable defense to the attack on affirmative action that less qualified female borrowers are selected over more qualified male borrowers [30]. In fact, more qualified female borrowers—in terms of expected return rates—are selected by the investors.On a cautionary note, statistical discrimination by itself is likely to be illegal in many jurisdictions. In order to qualify as affirmativeaction, a practice must be narrowly tailored, not violate the rights of non-protected groups, and meet other legal requirements.

While existing studies on P2P lending focus on disparate treatment (DT), DT narrowly recognizes direct discrimination and overlooks indirect and proxy discrimination, providing an incomplete picture. In this work, we measure a broadened discrimination notion called disparate impact (DI), which encompasses any dispar-ity in the loan’s funding rate that does not commensurate with the actual return rate. We develop a two-stage predictor substitution approach to estimate DI from observational data. Our findings reveal (i) female borrowers, given identical actual return rates, are 3.97% more likely to receive funding, (ii) at least 37.1% of this DIs favoring female is indirect or proxy discrimination, and (iii) DT indeed underestimates the overall female favoritism by 44.6%.

These results altogether tell a cautionary tale:on one hand, P2P lending provides a valuable alternative credit market where the affirmative action to support female naturally emerges from the rational crowd; on the other hand, while the overall discrimination effect (both in terms of DI or DT) favor female, concerning taste-based discrimination can persist and can be obscured by other coexisting discrimination drivers, such as statistical discrimination [...] P2P Lending as a Market-based Affirmative Action Given The reality that gender gap in financial access still persists [40] and female is still disadvantaged in many other credit markets [29, 31,89], our empirical results suggest online P2P lending provides an alternative credit market where the affirmative action to support female can arise naturally from the rational crowd. We take a liberal interpretation of affirmative action that focuses on the effect of nar-rowing existing inequality but does not imply intentions from the investors and/or the platform, similar to the discussion of market affirmative action in Cooter [37]. Below, we discuss two reasons why P2P lending can be a desirable policy instrument to narrow the gender gap in financial access. First, the affirmative action in P2P lending is driven by market forces, which is arguably more efficient than heavy-handed bureaucratic rules such as quota systems [22, 34]. The P2P lending market functions like a perfectly competitive market because (i) the size of P2P loans is typically small and (ii) there is a large number of investors. Based on standard demand-supply analysis [37], the market competition will impose the cost of gender animus—in the form of lower expected return—upon the investors who demandit.

35,P2PLendingPlatform,reflectsPrecept,MarketCompetition,"This paper investigates gender discrimination and its underlying drivers on a prominent Chinese online peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platform. While existing studies on P2P lending focus on disparate treatment (DT), DT narrowly recognizes direct discrimination and overlooks indirect and proxy discrimination, providing an incomplete picture. In this work, we measure a broadened discrimination notion called disparate impact (DI), which encompasses any dispar-ity in the loan’s funding rate that does not commensurate with the actual return rate. We develop a two-stage predictor substitution approach to estimate DI from observational data. Our findings reveal (i) female borrowers, given identical actual return rates, are 3.97% more likely to receive funding, (ii) at least 37.1% of this DIs favoring female is indirect or proxy discrimination, and (iii) DT indeed underestimates the overall female favoritism by 44.6%. How-ever, we also identify the overall female favoritism can be explained by one specific discrimination driver, rational statistical discrim-ination, wherein investors accurately predict the expected return rate from imperfect observations. Furthermore, female borrowers still require 2% higher expected return rate to secure funding, in-dicating another driver taste-based discrimination co-exists andis against female. These results altogether tell a cautionary tale:on one hand, P2P lending provides a valuable alternative credit market where the affirmative action to support female naturally emerges from the rational crowd; on the other hand, while the overall discrimination effect (both in terms of DI or DT) favor female, concerning taste-based discrimination can persist and can be obscured by other coexisting discrimination drivers, such as statistical discrimination [...] P2P Lending as a Market-based Affirmative Action Given The reality that gender gap in financial access still persists [40] and female is still disadvantaged in many other credit markets [29, 31,89], our empirical results suggest online P2P lending provides an alternative credit market where the affirmative action to support female can arise naturally from the rational crowd. We take a liberal interpretation of affirmative action that focuses on the effect of nar-rowing existing inequality but does not imply intentions from the investors and/or the platform, similar to the discussion of market affirmative action in Cooter [37]. Below, we discuss two reasons why P2P lending can be a desirable policy instrument to narrow the gender gap in financial access. First, the affirmative action in P2P lending is driven by market forces, which is arguably more efficient than heavy-handed bureaucratic rules such as quota systems [22, 34]. The P2P lending market functions like a perfectly competitive market because (i) the size of P2P loans is typically small and (ii) there is a large number of investors. Based on standard demand-supply analysis [37], the market competition will impose the cost of gender animus—in the form of lower expected return—upon the investors who demandit. Therefore, competition reduces gender animus. Competition, however, will not eliminate statistical discrimination because itis efficient and reflects rational behavior [75]. Consequently, be-cause females are indeed less likely to default on their P2P loans,the market forces will drive the investors to engage in statistical discrimination that favors female. Second, affirmative action resulted from statistical discrimina-tion leads to an important narrative shift. The female borrowers favorable DI is incentivized by their own higher expected return rates rather than being granted due to their disadvantaged socio-economical status. Particularly, it generates a viable defense to the attack on affirmative action that less qualified female borrowers are selected over more qualified male borrowers [30]. In fact, more qualified female borrowers—in terms of expected return rates—are selected by the investors.On a cautionary note, statistical discrimination by itself is likely to be illegal in many jurisdictions. In order to qualify as affirmativeaction, a practice must be narrowly tailored, not violate the rights of non-protected groups, and meet other legal requirements. Sincewe lack expertise in law, we refrain from delving into the discussion of legality in this paper.Gender Animus Can Still Exist Under Favorable DisparateImpact While our study on disparate impact reveals a larger female favoritism on the collaborated P2P lending platform than disparate treatment, We caution against making overly simplistic or absolute interpretations of the findings.
