9,Artists,Agent,"Artists have worked with AI and emerging digital technologies since at least the 1960s [63] [66]. A body of literature in cultural AI[40] [57] looks at direct applications of AI in the creative industries(Davies, 2020) or within the wider landscape of computational and new media arts [68] [49]. Some scholars, such as Fry [24], point out that AI literacy can be an issue for people deploying creative tools that are opaque in how they operate; Bryan-Kinns et al. [9]note, regarding AI-generated music, “only a few creative AI systems explain what their models are doing, how they do it, and why” (p.4). Beyond this literature about AI as artistic tool is research about art that makes AI a topic for critical engagement [27]. In this area,scholars ask about the role of creativity and artistic value of using AI to generate novel artworks [16], issues of agency and authorship[70] and the socio-political foundations of AI [73].Researchers have also looked at strategies of AI artists to address complex and multi-dimensional issues alongside aesthetic and tech-nical themes when working with creative applications of AI [30]. We identify a field of critical practice – critical AI arts – in which artists work with AI technologies and data both as medium and as them, both as tool and as topic. Stark and Crawford (2019) simi-larly observe artists who used AI to craft critical literacies in their audience, writing, “Many artists sought to provoke audiences by defamiliarizing the opaque and proprietary nature of software tools commonly covered by trade secret protections and functioning as‘black boxes’ ” [62] (p.5).Artists who engage with AI as both tool and theme have ad-dressed issues such as accessibility, by allowing non-technicians to build interactive systems (Fiebrink and Cook’s Wekinator [23]);bias, through engagement with the underlying politics of a system(Crawford and Paglen’s ImageNet Roulette [15]) or the absence in datasets (Mimi Onuoha’s What is Missing Is Still There [48]) and the failures of AI systems in recognising iconic African Ameri-can women (Buolawmini’s AI, Ain’t I A Woman? [10]); labor (AIOracle, no:topia collective 2018); prejudice, via an interactive art-work examining the concept of ‘normal’ and algorithmic prejudice (Zer-Aviv’s Normalising Machine [71]), and surveillance (Elahi’sTracking Transience [18]).The approaches and strategies of artists working with AI as both tool and topic here fold into a longer lineage of artists that have engaged in political critique [25], continuing to more contemporary socially-engaged participatory art [5][55] and speculative design,which uses non-functional design artifacts to stimulate critical dis-cussion [17]. As Simoniti [60] notes, such practices are dedicated pragmatically to impact, aligning art with social work and activism around technology development. Such work raises questions about how art may feed into scientific processes of design and develop-ment and how artists and practitioners can mutually inform each other's practices. Tromble [65] charts the entanglements between art practice and scientific research in AI, arguing that artists, often steeped in the humanities, are likely to raise questions about how AI can be beneficial, as opposed to commercially successful, and keep technological possibilities in play. In a similar vein, with regard to accountability, Jensen [33] observes that art can offer checks on practitioners' conscience and keep designers accountable.",933-4,Artists,
