9,SupportingMigrantJobSearch,Perceived_Problem,"Previous work on technology in Public Employment Services and job market chances has focused on profiling systems that are in-tended for tasks such as assessing and classifying jobseekers. To Integrate into the local job market, migrants and refugees seek sup-port from the Public Employment Services (PES), but also non-profit,non-governmental organizations (herein referred to as third sector organizations, or TSOs). How do design visions for technologies to support jobseekers change when developed not under bureau-cratic rules but by people interacting directly and informally with jobseekers? We focus on the perspectives of TSO workers assisting migrants and refugees seeking support for their job search.Through interviews and a design fiction exercise, we investigate (1)the role of TSO workers, (2) factors beyond those used in profiling systems that they consider relevant, and (3) their ideal technology.We describe how TSO workers contextualize formal criteria used in profiling systems while prioritizing jobseekers’ personal interests and strengths. Based on our findings on existing tools and methods,and imagined future technologies, we propose a software-based project that expands existing job taxonomies into a coordinated resource combining job characteristics, required competencies, and soft skills to support multiple informational tools for jobseekers. 6.1 InterviewsThe interviews were summarized into four themes. Our participants described factors they take into consideration when assessing which job is suitable for the person they are advising and for assessing what their chances of finding a new job are. The interviews also focused on the approaches they use when working with clients.6.1.1 Using standard, formal criteria. TSO counselors work, to some extent, with and on the same factors that PES counselors and systems use: the opportunities and challenges afforded by age,knowledge of the German language, job experience, and education level. They also take into account the de-facto challenges posed by care obligations (real or perceived consequences on availability and flexibility) and religion (employer reluctance to hire Muslimwomen wearing a headscarf in customer-facing jobs such as retailor hospitality). In advising clients, our participants often face dilemmas. Oneexample is the ambiguous role of apprenticeships. On the one hand,apprenticeships are highly valued in the German job market that relies strongly on qualifications and their formal certification, and being in an apprenticeship can help the apprentice secure a longer-term residence permit [16, 28]. On the other hand, average appren-ticeship earnings are less than half of a full-time position at minimum wage [32, 36, 38], which deters many migrants and refugees who have to provide for their families, and jobseekers perceived as“too old” (beyond mid-20s) or holding a current residence permit with a short remaining duration may not even be considered by employers.6.1.2 Valuing qualifications beyond formal criteria. Once formal conditions are clear, the TSOs workers look for criteria for successful job search that are often not taken into consideration in ADM systems. These include so-called soft skills, especially the willingness to learn, and motivation.Participants mentioned communication skills and openness to-wards other people the most. When it comes to jobs with customer contact, several participants mentioned that their clients sometimes reject these jobs even if they have good communication skills due to experiences of racism. Others had rejected such jobs because they were frustrated by their slow progress in learning the German Language. One participant mentioned that jobs in accountancy were very popular with his clients for a while because these preferred a job with numbers instead of language. Some clients give up learn-ing German and decide to pursue jobs that are typically labeled as“low-skilled” and do not require language proficiency .Additional influencing factors that were mentioned include mo-tivation and willingness to learn more about jobs, as well as the mindset that one has towards job applications and work in general.One participant gave the following example: So when you approach this with an “I don’t care, the main thing is to find work-” attitude, yes of course, then you’re more likely to find jobs where you're completely interchangeable and replaceable. Or if you instead somehow approach work with a desire and apply for jobs that you are interested in and so on.The ability to work in a team, friendliness, flexibility and resilience were deemed important as well. One of our participants mentioned that she asks her clients whether they like to work in-dividually or in groups and whether they prefer a more dynamic working environment or a more systematic one.Informal job experience, such as having helped out in a family car shop or having cared for children, was also valued by our par-ticipants. In the highly formalized German job market, informal job knowledge is usually insufficient to find employment, but can be a good starting point for choosing further steps. One participant gave the example of a Syrian woman who did not have any formal degree or apprenticeship, but had worked with special-needs children inSyria, so she was able to secure funding for training to become a nursing specialist. 6.1.3 Empowering jobseekers through information. Our participants mentioned that jobseekers need information and knowledge to enter the German job market. In this context, one phrase was mentioned in several interviews: “help for self-help” (German: “Hilfe Zur Selbsthilfe”). As one participant put it: “Not that we overburden him [a jobseeker] but that we offer him help where he needs it and there, what is so beautifully understood by this funny term empowerment, demand from him what he can also do himself.”Another participant compared the role of TSOs to guardrails for jobseekers:The idea is always [...] to try to empower the client to go the way themselves, supporting them with in-formation. [...]. And then it doesn’t matter whether the client is speeding on the left lane at 160 or creep-ing along the right lane at 60, but at least the rough direction is clear. And if they get too far off course,you’re the guardrail and can hopefully help them find their way back to the original course.This supporting information can take the form of answering questions related to the entire process of job search such as “Where Can I find a German course? How can I get funding? How do I get my certificates recognized? What are my legal rights?”. In particular when it comes to writing application letters, one of our participants mentioned the importance of empowerment, because employers value greatly the ability to work independently. One participant mentioned supporting jobseekers by informing them about labor laws, as she hopes to help them better understand both their own and their employer’s obligations. She mentioned that there are violations from both sides, such as turning up late for work, but also unlawful firing of people.It was mentioned that information available on jobs differs across professions, e.g. health sector jobs have good information available,while others do not. In many interviews the sheer number of existing types of jobs and the impossibility to provide information on all of them was mentioned as a problem. There are projects through which jobseekers can gain insight into different jobs by going to participating companies. Another way our participant support jobseekers is by organizing internships and by providing information through activities and events for networking or gettingadvice.Social capital is used in the sense of offering or disseminating information through social media channels or personal networks of the organization’s volunteers, by connecting the jobseeker to a person who works in a similar job, or by recommending job seekers to a potential employer. Jobseekers sometimes call their TSO advisor after a few months to tell them about their progress in a new job.Some of the organizations offer a type of mentoring for longer-term assistance in job search. The organizations also communicate with each other forming a wider network that allows them to refer job seekers to other organizations if their needs are not within the organization's competencies.The “help for self-help” principle is often applied for resumes.One of the organizations offers information events regarding job applications, as the structure and content of resumes may differ from those that are standard in jobseekers’ countries of origin.All organizations offer individual help with resume writing. Oneparticipant mentioned that in 80% of the cases, she helps clients make a new resume or alter their existing one. When she helps jobseekers with their resume, they sit in front of the computer together and she types, while the jobseekers tell her what they've done in their life, and they compare that to the existing resume and discuss. Her goal is to enable the jobseekers to use an online tool for resume building. Another participant who also uses online tools argued that resumes are “so complicated here in Germany, so strict.”One of the organizations has a link list with jobs in specific sectors,which they give to jobseekers once they have finished writing their resume.6.1.4 Exploring personal interests and strengths. One of the most important aspects of the counselling is the exploration of personal interests and strengths. Some jobseekers approach TSOs with a clear idea in mind, others look for guidance on suitable jobs. Theseare explored through different approaches, e.g. by asking about hobbies. One situation was described as follows:We asked him: Do you have any hobbies? Do you like to do anything? He couldn’t answer. But when we asked him, it turned out that he is very athletic, yes, he does a lot of sports. That was at least a point of contact. And we then agreed to move forward [...]that we said we would check out what vacancies there might be as a sports specialist. A similar approach was described by another participant: she described talking “about life in general” to find out what her clients’“true interests” are.All participants mentioned that jobseekers’ wishes are prioritized over suggestions from the counselor. One participant explicitly said “I definitely don’t say what job [...] is suitable, that’s up to them to decide,” and recommends doing an internship to get some deeper insight if there are doubts. If a person is interested in a job, then they look at job advertisements and the required skills and competencies for the job together. During one interview, it was mentioned that if jobseekers have a specific job they would like to pursue but cannot find employment due to reasons such as language skills, the counselor tries to find similar jobs. In one interview it was mentioned that the participant tried to use the online tests provided by the German PES but did not find them helpful:It’s not really intended for people who can’t speak German very well. [The tool’s output indicated simply that] he can work very independently, that he is very communicative and that he can react very well in conflict situations. But all of that, I would say, doesn’t point in a professional direction yet. She called the tests a “waste of time,” compared them to assess-ment center tests, and stated that, due to the way questions are formulated, a rich vocabulary in German is required. She also men-tioned that she tried to use tests on commercial websites but found the descriptions of jobs were too short to use during counselling. Instead, she started using competency cards with her clients, which are explained below. Participants described a range of methods and approaches that they use during job counseling to explore personal interests and strengths:Competency cards (German: Kompetenzkarten) [10, 11]: The Cards are available in different languages (among them Arabic,Farsi and Russian) and cover the areas of social, personal, technical and methodological competency (e.g. ability to work in a team).Each card includes a picture, a translation of the competency into different languages, and a description in plain language. There are also references to further information on the respective competency.Some of the cards have a red border which indicates that they can be specifically used in the profiling phase in the German PES. Theparticipant said she lets the jobseekers pick out three cards and explain why they think they have this competency.Videos: During several interviews, it was mentioned that there are videos of certain jobs that can be shown to jobseekers, such as videos about what an electrician or mechanic does at work.Life profile (German: Lebens Profil) [41]: This is a biography-oriented analysis aimed at taking a structured and comprehensive look at the past. It covers stages and activities alongside the career(e.g. volunteering and family work) and provides an overview of what has been learned in each case. Competencies can be derivedfrom the life profile. Women who come for counseling are asked to talk about their life experiences and prior activities, including their refugee experience, or divorce, for instance. The counselor then derives competencies from this. The TSO considers competencies to be transferable from private life to professional life. One of the participants said she encourages “women to distance themselves from outside pressure and focus on their inner self.”Photo interest test: (German: Foto-Interessen-Test) [64, 65]: Thisset of photographs contains around 130 photos of different jobs that are used as a basis for conversation with jobseekers. The origi-nal test is computer-based and the jobseeker uses mouse clicks to profess either no interest, average interest, or high interest. Ourparticipant uses these in a paper-based format in cases were there might be language difficulties and no interpreter is available.

If a person is interested in a job, then they look at job advertisements and the required skills and competencies for the job together. During one interview, it was mentioned that if jobseekers have a specific job they would like to pursue but cannot find employment due to reasons such as language skills, the counselor tries to find similar jobs. In one interview it was mentioned that the participant tried to use the online tests provided by the German PES but did not find them helpful:It’s not really intended for people who can’t speak German very well. [The tool’s output indicated simply that] he can work very independently, that he is very communicative and that he can react very well in conflict situations. But all of that, I would say, doesn’t point in a professional direction yet. She called the tests a “waste of time,” compared them to assess-ment center tests, and stated that, due to the way questions are formulated, a rich vocabulary in German is required. She also men-tioned that she tried to use tests on commercial websites but found the descriptions of jobs were too short to use during counselling. Instead, she started using competency cards with her clients, which are explained below. Participants described a range of methods and approaches that they use during job counseling to explore personal interests and strengths:Competency cards (German: Kompetenzkarten) [10, 11]: The Cards are available in different languages (among them Arabic,Farsi and Russian) and cover the areas of social, personal, technical and methodological competency (e.g. ability to work in a team).Each card includes a picture, a translation of the competency into different languages, and a description in plain language. There are also references to further information on the respective competency.Some of the cards have a red border which indicates that they can be specifically used in the profiling phase in the German PES. Theparticipant said she lets the jobseekers pick out three cards and explain why they think they have this competency.Videos: During several interviews, it was mentioned that there are videos of certain jobs that can be shown to jobseekers, such as videos about what an electrician or mechanic does at work.Life profile (German: Lebens Profil) [41]: This is a biography-oriented analysis aimed at taking a structured and comprehensive look at the past. It covers stages and activities alongside the career(e.g. volunteering and family work) and provides an overview of what has been learned in each case. Competencies can be derivedfrom the life profile. Women who come for counseling are asked to talk about their life experiences and prior activities, including their refugee experience, or divorce, for instance. The counselor then derives competencies from this. The TSO considers competencies to be transferable from private life to professional life. One of the participants said she encourages “women to distance themselves from outside pressure and focus on their inner self.”Photo interest test: (German: Foto-Interessen-Test) [64, 65]: Thisset of photographs contains around 130 photos of different jobs that are used as a basis for conversation with jobseekers. The origi-nal test is computer-based and the jobseeker uses mouse clicks to profess either no interest, average interest, or high interest. Ourparticipant uses these in a paper-based format in cases were there might be language difficulties and no interpreter is available. ","972, 976-7",experiences of racism,
12,SlowGermanLanguageLearning,Perceived_Problem,"Previous work on technology in Public Employment Services and job market chances has focused on profiling systems that are in-tended for tasks such as assessing and classifying jobseekers. To Integrate into the local job market, migrants and refugees seek sup-port from the Public Employment Services (PES), but also non-profit,non-governmental organizations (herein referred to as third sector organizations, or TSOs). How do design visions for technologies to support jobseekers change when developed not under bureau-cratic rules but by people interacting directly and informally with jobseekers? We focus on the perspectives of TSO workers assisting migrants and refugees seeking support for their job search.Through interviews and a design fiction exercise, we investigate (1)the role of TSO workers, (2) factors beyond those used in profiling systems that they consider relevant, and (3) their ideal technology.We describe how TSO workers contextualize formal criteria used in profiling systems while prioritizing jobseekers’ personal interests and strengths. Based on our findings on existing tools and methods,and imagined future technologies, we propose a software-based project that expands existing job taxonomies into a coordinated resource combining job characteristics, required competencies, and soft skills to support multiple informational tools for jobseekers. 6.1 InterviewsThe interviews were summarized into four themes. Our participants described factors they take into consideration when assessing which job is suitable for the person they are advising and for assessing what their chances of finding a new job are. The interviews also focused on the approaches they use when working with clients.6.1.1 Using standard, formal criteria. TSO counselors work, to some extent, with and on the same factors that PES counselors and systems use: the opportunities and challenges afforded by age,knowledge of the German language, job experience, and education level. They also take into account the de-facto challenges posed by care obligations (real or perceived consequences on availability and flexibility) and religion (employer reluctance to hire Muslimwomen wearing a headscarf in customer-facing jobs such as retailor hospitality). In advising clients, our participants often face dilemmas. Oneexample is the ambiguous role of apprenticeships. On the one hand,apprenticeships are highly valued in the German job market that relies strongly on qualifications and their formal certification, and being in an apprenticeship can help the apprentice secure a longer-term residence permit [16, 28]. On the other hand, average appren-ticeship earnings are less than half of a full-time position at minimum wage [32, 36, 38], which deters many migrants and refugees who have to provide for their families, and jobseekers perceived as“too old” (beyond mid-20s) or holding a current residence permit with a short remaining duration may not even be considered by employers.6.1.2 Valuing qualifications beyond formal criteria. Once formal conditions are clear, the TSOs workers look for criteria for successful job search that are often not taken into consideration in ADM systems. These include so-called soft skills, especially the willingness to learn, and motivation.Participants mentioned communication skills and openness to-wards other people the most. When it comes to jobs with customer contact, several participants mentioned that their clients sometimes reject these jobs even if they have good communication skills due to experiences of racism. Others had rejected such jobs because they were frustrated by their slow progress in learning the German Language. One participant mentioned that jobs in accountancy were very popular with his clients for a while because these preferred a job with numbers instead of language. Some clients give up learn-ing German and decide to pursue jobs that are typically labeled as“low-skilled” and do not require language proficiency .Additional influencing factors that were mentioned include mo-tivation and willingness to learn more about jobs, as well as the mindset that one has towards job applications and work in general.One participant gave the following example: So when you approach this with an “I don’t care, the main thing is to find work-” attitude, yes of course, then you’re more likely to find jobs where you're completely interchangeable and replaceable. Or if you instead somehow approach work with a desire and apply for jobs that you are interested in and so on.The ability to work in a team, friendliness, flexibility and resilience were deemed important as well. One of our participants mentioned that she asks her clients whether they like to work in-dividually or in groups and whether they prefer a more dynamic working environment or a more systematic one.Informal job experience, such as having helped out in a family car shop or having cared for children, was also valued by our par-ticipants. In the highly formalized German job market, informal job knowledge is usually insufficient to find employment, but can be a good starting point for choosing further steps. One participant gave the example of a Syrian woman who did not have any formal degree or apprenticeship, but had worked with special-needs children inSyria, so she was able to secure funding for training to become a nursing specialist. 6.1.3 Empowering jobseekers through information. Our participants mentioned that jobseekers need information and knowledge to enter the German job market. In this context, one phrase was mentioned in several interviews: “help for self-help” (German: “Hilfe Zur Selbsthilfe”). As one participant put it: “Not that we overburden him [a jobseeker] but that we offer him help where he needs it and there, what is so beautifully understood by this funny term empowerment, demand from him what he can also do himself.”Another participant compared the role of TSOs to guardrails for jobseekers:The idea is always [...] to try to empower the client to go the way themselves, supporting them with in-formation. [...]. And then it doesn’t matter whether the client is speeding on the left lane at 160 or creep-ing along the right lane at 60, but at least the rough direction is clear. And if they get too far off course,you’re the guardrail and can hopefully help them find their way back to the original course.This supporting information can take the form of answering questions related to the entire process of job search such as “Where Can I find a German course? How can I get funding? How do I get my certificates recognized? What are my legal rights?”. In particular when it comes to writing application letters, one of our participants mentioned the importance of empowerment, because employers value greatly the ability to work independently. One participant mentioned supporting jobseekers by informing them about labor laws, as she hopes to help them better understand both their own and their employer’s obligations. She mentioned that there are violations from both sides, such as turning up late for work, but also unlawful firing of people.It was mentioned that information available on jobs differs across professions, e.g. health sector jobs have good information available,while others do not. In many interviews the sheer number of existing types of jobs and the impossibility to provide information on all of them was mentioned as a problem. There are projects through which jobseekers can gain insight into different jobs by going to participating companies. Another way our participant support jobseekers is by organizing internships and by providing information through activities and events for networking or gettingadvice.Social capital is used in the sense of offering or disseminating information through social media channels or personal networks of the organization’s volunteers, by connecting the jobseeker to a person who works in a similar job, or by recommending job seekers to a potential employer. Jobseekers sometimes call their TSO advisor after a few months to tell them about their progress in a new job.Some of the organizations offer a type of mentoring for longer-term assistance in job search. The organizations also communicate with each other forming a wider network that allows them to refer job seekers to other organizations if their needs are not within the organization's competencies.The “help for self-help” principle is often applied for resumes.One of the organizations offers information events regarding job applications, as the structure and content of resumes may differ from those that are standard in jobseekers’ countries of origin.All organizations offer individual help with resume writing. Oneparticipant mentioned that in 80% of the cases, she helps clients make a new resume or alter their existing one. When she helps jobseekers with their resume, they sit in front of the computer together and she types, while the jobseekers tell her what they've done in their life, and they compare that to the existing resume and discuss. Her goal is to enable the jobseekers to use an online tool for resume building. Another participant who also uses online tools argued that resumes are “so complicated here in Germany, so strict.”One of the organizations has a link list with jobs in specific sectors,which they give to jobseekers once they have finished writing their resume.6.1.4 Exploring personal interests and strengths. One of the most important aspects of the counselling is the exploration of personal interests and strengths. Some jobseekers approach TSOs with a clear idea in mind, others look for guidance on suitable jobs. Theseare explored through different approaches, e.g. by asking about hobbies. One situation was described as follows:We asked him: Do you have any hobbies? Do you like to do anything? He couldn’t answer. But when we asked him, it turned out that he is very athletic, yes, he does a lot of sports. That was at least a point of contact. And we then agreed to move forward [...]that we said we would check out what vacancies there might be as a sports specialist. A similar approach was described by another participant: she described talking “about life in general” to find out what her clients’“true interests” are.All participants mentioned that jobseekers’ wishes are prioritized over suggestions from the counselor. One participant explicitly said “I definitely don’t say what job [...] is suitable, that’s up to them to decide,” and recommends doing an internship to get some deeper insight if there are doubts.

Another way our participant support jobseekers is by organizing internships and by providing information through activities and events for networking or gettingadvice.Social capital is used in the sense of offering or disseminating information through social media channels or personal networks of the organization’s volunteers, by connecting the jobseeker to a person who works in a similar job, or by recommending job seekers to a potential employer. Jobseekers sometimes call their TSO advisor after a few months to tell them about their progress in a new job.Some of the organizations offer a type of mentoring for longer-term assistance in job search. The organizations also communicate with each other forming a wider network that allows them to refer job seekers to other organizations if their needs are not within the organization's competencies.The “help for self-help” principle is often applied for resumes.One of the organizations offers information events regarding job applications, as the structure and content of resumes may differ from those that are standard in jobseekers’ countries of origin.All organizations offer individual help with resume writing. Oneparticipant mentioned that in 80% of the cases, she helps clients make a new resume or alter their existing one. When she helps jobseekers with their resume, they sit in front of the computer together and she types, while the jobseekers tell her what they've done in their life, and they compare that to the existing resume and discuss. Her goal is to enable the jobseekers to use an online tool for resume building. Another participant who also uses online tools argued that resumes are “so complicated here in Germany, so strict.”One of the organizations has a link list with jobs in specific sectors,which they give to jobseekers once they have finished writing their resume.6.1.4 Exploring personal interests and strengths. One of the most important aspects of the counselling is the exploration of personal interests and strengths. Some jobseekers approach TSOs with a clear idea in mind, others look for guidance on suitable jobs. Theseare explored through different approaches, e.g. by asking about hobbies. One situation was described as follows:We asked him: Do you have any hobbies? Do you like to do anything? He couldn’t answer. But when we asked him, it turned out that he is very athletic, yes, he does a lot of sports. That was at least a point of contact. And we then agreed to move forward [...]that we said we would check out what vacancies there might be as a sports specialist. A similar approach was described by another participant: she described talking “about life in general” to find out what her clients’“true interests” are.All participants mentioned that jobseekers’ wishes are prioritized over suggestions from the counselor. One participant explicitly said “I definitely don’t say what job [...] is suitable, that’s up to them to decide,” and recommends doing an internship to get some deeper insight if there are doubts. If a person is interested in a job, then they look at job advertisements and the required skills and competencies for the job together. During one interview, it was mentioned that if jobseekers have a specific job they would like to pursue but cannot find employment due to reasons such as language skills, the counselor tries to find similar jobs. In one interview it was mentioned that the participant tried to use the online tests provided by the German PES but did not find them helpful:It’s not really intended for people who can’t speak German very well. [The tool’s output indicated simply that] he can work very independently, that he is very communicative and that he can react very well in conflict situations. But all of that, I would say, doesn’t point in a professional direction yet. She called the tests a “waste of time,” compared them to assess-ment center tests, and stated that, due to the way questions are formulated, a rich vocabulary in German is required. She also men-tioned that she tried to use tests on commercial websites but found the descriptions of jobs were too short to use during counselling. Instead, she started using competency cards with her clients, which are explained below. Participants described a range of methods and approaches that they use during job counseling to explore personal interests and strengths:Competency cards (German: Kompetenzkarten) [10, 11]: The Cards are available in different languages (among them Arabic,Farsi and Russian) and cover the areas of social, personal, technical and methodological competency (e.g. ability to work in a team).Each card includes a picture, a translation of the competency into different languages, and a description in plain language. There are also references to further information on the respective competency.Some of the cards have a red border which indicates that they can be specifically used in the profiling phase in the German PES. Theparticipant said she lets the jobseekers pick out three cards and explain why they think they have this competency.Videos: During several interviews, it was mentioned that there are videos of certain jobs that can be shown to jobseekers, such as videos about what an electrician or mechanic does at work.Life profile (German: Lebens Profil) [41]: This is a biography-oriented analysis aimed at taking a structured and comprehensive look at the past. It covers stages and activities alongside the career(e.g. volunteering and family work) and provides an overview of what has been learned in each case. Competencies can be derivedfrom the life profile. Women who come for counseling are asked to talk about their life experiences and prior activities, including their refugee experience, or divorce, for instance. The counselor then derives competencies from this. The TSO considers competencies to be transferable from private life to professional life. One of the participants said she encourages “women to distance themselves from outside pressure and focus on their inner self.”Photo interest test: (German: Foto-Interessen-Test) [64, 65]: Thisset of photographs contains around 130 photos of different jobs that are used as a basis for conversation with jobseekers. The origi-nal test is computer-based and the jobseeker uses mouse clicks to profess either no interest, average interest, or high interest. Ourparticipant uses these in a paper-based format in cases were there might be language difficulties and no interpreter is available. ","972, 976-7",look for guidance on suitable jobs.,
15,PESOnlineTests,Artifact,"Previous work on technology in Public Employment Services and job market chances has focused on profiling systems that are in-tended for tasks such as assessing and classifying jobseekers. To Integrate into the local job market, migrants and refugees seek sup-port from the Public Employment Services (PES), but also non-profit,non-governmental organizations (herein referred to as third sector organizations, or TSOs). How do design visions for technologies to support jobseekers change when developed not under bureau-cratic rules but by people interacting directly and informally with jobseekers? We focus on the perspectives of TSO workers assisting migrants and refugees seeking support for their job search.Through interviews and a design fiction exercise, we investigate (1)the role of TSO workers, (2) factors beyond those used in profiling systems that they consider relevant, and (3) their ideal technology.We describe how TSO workers contextualize formal criteria used in profiling systems while prioritizing jobseekers’ personal interests and strengths. Based on our findings on existing tools and methods,and imagined future technologies, we propose a software-based project that expands existing job taxonomies into a coordinated resource combining job characteristics, required competencies, and soft skills to support multiple informational tools for jobseekers. 6.1 InterviewsThe interviews were summarized into four themes. Our participants described factors they take into consideration when assessing which job is suitable for the person they are advising and for assessing what their chances of finding a new job are. The interviews also focused on the approaches they use when working with clients.6.1.1 Using standard, formal criteria. TSO counselors work, to some extent, with and on the same factors that PES counselors and systems use: the opportunities and challenges afforded by age,knowledge of the German language, job experience, and education level. They also take into account the de-facto challenges posed by care obligations (real or perceived consequences on availability and flexibility) and religion (employer reluctance to hire Muslimwomen wearing a headscarf in customer-facing jobs such as retailor hospitality). In advising clients, our participants often face dilemmas. Oneexample is the ambiguous role of apprenticeships. On the one hand,apprenticeships are highly valued in the German job market that relies strongly on qualifications and their formal certification, and being in an apprenticeship can help the apprentice secure a longer-term residence permit [16, 28]. On the other hand, average appren-ticeship earnings are less than half of a full-time position at minimum wage [32, 36, 38], which deters many migrants and refugees who have to provide for their families, and jobseekers perceived as“too old” (beyond mid-20s) or holding a current residence permit with a short remaining duration may not even be considered by employers.6.1.2 Valuing qualifications beyond formal criteria. Once formal conditions are clear, the TSOs workers look for criteria for successful job search that are often not taken into consideration in ADM systems. These include so-called soft skills, especially the willingness to learn, and motivation.Participants mentioned communication skills and openness to-wards other people the most. When it comes to jobs with customer contact, several participants mentioned that their clients sometimes reject these jobs even if they have good communication skills due to experiences of racism. Others had rejected such jobs because they were frustrated by their slow progress in learning the German Language. One participant mentioned that jobs in accountancy were very popular with his clients for a while because these preferred a job with numbers instead of language. Some clients give up learn-ing German and decide to pursue jobs that are typically labeled as“low-skilled” and do not require language proficiency .Additional influencing factors that were mentioned include mo-tivation and willingness to learn more about jobs, as well as the mindset that one has towards job applications and work in general.One participant gave the following example: So when you approach this with an “I don’t care, the main thing is to find work-” attitude, yes of course, then you’re more likely to find jobs where you're completely interchangeable and replaceable. Or if you instead somehow approach work with a desire and apply for jobs that you are interested in and so on.The ability to work in a team, friendliness, flexibility and resilience were deemed important as well. One of our participants mentioned that she asks her clients whether they like to work in-dividually or in groups and whether they prefer a more dynamic working environment or a more systematic one.Informal job experience, such as having helped out in a family car shop or having cared for children, was also valued by our par-ticipants. In the highly formalized German job market, informal job knowledge is usually insufficient to find employment, but can be a good starting point for choosing further steps. One participant gave the example of a Syrian woman who did not have any formal degree or apprenticeship, but had worked with special-needs children inSyria, so she was able to secure funding for training to become a nursing specialist. 6.1.3 Empowering jobseekers through information. Our participants mentioned that jobseekers need information and knowledge to enter the German job market. In this context, one phrase was mentioned in several interviews: “help for self-help” (German: “Hilfe Zur Selbsthilfe”). As one participant put it: “Not that we overburden him [a jobseeker] but that we offer him help where he needs it and there, what is so beautifully understood by this funny term empowerment, demand from him what he can also do himself.”Another participant compared the role of TSOs to guardrails for jobseekers:The idea is always [...] to try to empower the client to go the way themselves, supporting them with in-formation. [...]. And then it doesn’t matter whether the client is speeding on the left lane at 160 or creep-ing along the right lane at 60, but at least the rough direction is clear. And if they get too far off course,you’re the guardrail and can hopefully help them find their way back to the original course.This supporting information can take the form of answering questions related to the entire process of job search such as “Where Can I find a German course? How can I get funding? How do I get my certificates recognized? What are my legal rights?”. In particular when it comes to writing application letters, one of our participants mentioned the importance of empowerment, because employers value greatly the ability to work independently. One participant mentioned supporting jobseekers by informing them about labor laws, as she hopes to help them better understand both their own and their employer’s obligations. She mentioned that there are violations from both sides, such as turning up late for work, but also unlawful firing of people.It was mentioned that information available on jobs differs across professions, e.g. health sector jobs have good information available,while others do not. In many interviews the sheer number of existing types of jobs and the impossibility to provide information on all of them was mentioned as a problem. There are projects through which jobseekers can gain insight into different jobs by going to participating companies. Another way our participant support jobseekers is by organizing internships and by providing information through activities and events for networking or gettingadvice.Social capital is used in the sense of offering or disseminating information through social media channels or personal networks of the organization’s volunteers, by connecting the jobseeker to a person who works in a similar job, or by recommending job seekers to a potential employer.

One of our participants mentioned that she asks her clients whether they like to work in-dividually or in groups and whether they prefer a more dynamic working environment or a more systematic one.Informal job experience, such as having helped out in a family car shop or having cared for children, was also valued by our par-ticipants. In the highly formalized German job market, informal job knowledge is usually insufficient to find employment, but can be a good starting point for choosing further steps. One participant gave the example of a Syrian woman who did not have any formal degree or apprenticeship, but had worked with special-needs children inSyria, so she was able to secure funding for training to become a nursing specialist. 6.1.3 Empowering jobseekers through information. Our participants mentioned that jobseekers need information and knowledge to enter the German job market. In this context, one phrase was mentioned in several interviews: “help for self-help” (German: “Hilfe Zur Selbsthilfe”). As one participant put it: “Not that we overburden him [a jobseeker] but that we offer him help where he needs it and there, what is so beautifully understood by this funny term empowerment, demand from him what he can also do himself.”Another participant compared the role of TSOs to guardrails for jobseekers:The idea is always [...] to try to empower the client to go the way themselves, supporting them with in-formation. [...]. And then it doesn’t matter whether the client is speeding on the left lane at 160 or creep-ing along the right lane at 60, but at least the rough direction is clear. And if they get too far off course,you’re the guardrail and can hopefully help them find their way back to the original course.This supporting information can take the form of answering questions related to the entire process of job search such as “Where Can I find a German course? How can I get funding? How do I get my certificates recognized? What are my legal rights?”. In particular when it comes to writing application letters, one of our participants mentioned the importance of empowerment, because employers value greatly the ability to work independently. One participant mentioned supporting jobseekers by informing them about labor laws, as she hopes to help them better understand both their own and their employer’s obligations. She mentioned that there are violations from both sides, such as turning up late for work, but also unlawful firing of people.It was mentioned that information available on jobs differs across professions, e.g. health sector jobs have good information available,while others do not. In many interviews the sheer number of existing types of jobs and the impossibility to provide information on all of them was mentioned as a problem. There are projects through which jobseekers can gain insight into different jobs by going to participating companies. Another way our participant support jobseekers is by organizing internships and by providing information through activities and events for networking or gettingadvice.Social capital is used in the sense of offering or disseminating information through social media channels or personal networks of the organization’s volunteers, by connecting the jobseeker to a person who works in a similar job, or by recommending job seekers to a potential employer. Jobseekers sometimes call their TSO advisor after a few months to tell them about their progress in a new job.Some of the organizations offer a type of mentoring for longer-term assistance in job search. The organizations also communicate with each other forming a wider network that allows them to refer job seekers to other organizations if their needs are not within the organization's competencies.The “help for self-help” principle is often applied for resumes.One of the organizations offers information events regarding job applications, as the structure and content of resumes may differ from those that are standard in jobseekers’ countries of origin.All organizations offer individual help with resume writing. Oneparticipant mentioned that in 80% of the cases, she helps clients make a new resume or alter their existing one. When she helps jobseekers with their resume, they sit in front of the computer together and she types, while the jobseekers tell her what they've done in their life, and they compare that to the existing resume and discuss. Her goal is to enable the jobseekers to use an online tool for resume building. Another participant who also uses online tools argued that resumes are “so complicated here in Germany, so strict.”One of the organizations has a link list with jobs in specific sectors,which they give to jobseekers once they have finished writing their resume.6.1.4 Exploring personal interests and strengths. One of the most important aspects of the counselling is the exploration of personal interests and strengths. Some jobseekers approach TSOs with a clear idea in mind, others look for guidance on suitable jobs. Theseare explored through different approaches, e.g. by asking about hobbies. One situation was described as follows:We asked him: Do you have any hobbies? Do you like to do anything? He couldn’t answer. But when we asked him, it turned out that he is very athletic, yes, he does a lot of sports. That was at least a point of contact. And we then agreed to move forward [...]that we said we would check out what vacancies there might be as a sports specialist. A similar approach was described by another participant: she described talking “about life in general” to find out what her clients’“true interests” are.All participants mentioned that jobseekers’ wishes are prioritized over suggestions from the counselor. One participant explicitly said “I definitely don’t say what job [...] is suitable, that’s up to them to decide,” and recommends doing an internship to get some deeper insight if there are doubts. If a person is interested in a job, then they look at job advertisements and the required skills and competencies for the job together. During one interview, it was mentioned that if jobseekers have a specific job they would like to pursue but cannot find employment due to reasons such as language skills, the counselor tries to find similar jobs. In one interview it was mentioned that the participant tried to use the online tests provided by the German PES but did not find them helpful:It’s not really intended for people who can’t speak German very well. [The tool’s output indicated simply that] he can work very independently, that he is very communicative and that he can react very well in conflict situations. But all of that, I would say, doesn’t point in a professional direction yet. She called the tests a “waste of time,” compared them to assess-ment center tests, and stated that, due to the way questions are formulated, a rich vocabulary in German is required. She also men-tioned that she tried to use tests on commercial websites but found the descriptions of jobs were too short to use during counselling. Instead, she started using competency cards with her clients, which are explained below. Participants described a range of methods and approaches that they use during job counseling to explore personal interests and strengths:Competency cards (German: Kompetenzkarten) [10, 11]: The Cards are available in different languages (among them Arabic,Farsi and Russian) and cover the areas of social, personal, technical and methodological competency (e.g. ability to work in a team).Each card includes a picture, a translation of the competency into different languages, and a description in plain language. There are also references to further information on the respective competency.Some of the cards have a red border which indicates that they can be specifically used in the profiling phase in the German PES. Theparticipant said she lets the jobseekers pick out three cards and explain why they think they have this competency.Videos: During several interviews, it was mentioned that there are videos of certain jobs that can be shown to jobseekers, such as videos about what an electrician or mechanic does at work.Life profile (German: Lebens Profil) [41]: This is a biography-oriented analysis aimed at taking a structured and comprehensive look at the past. It covers stages and activities alongside the career(e.g. volunteering and family work) and provides an overview of what has been learned in each case. Competencies can be derivedfrom the life profile. Women who come for counseling are asked to talk about their life experiences and prior activities, including their refugee experience, or divorce, for instance. The counselor then derives competencies from this. The TSO considers competencies to be transferable from private life to professional life. One of the participants said she encourages “women to distance themselves from outside pressure and focus on their inner self.”Photo interest test: (German: Foto-Interessen-Test) [64, 65]: Thisset of photographs contains around 130 photos of different jobs that are used as a basis for conversation with jobseekers. The origi-nal test is computer-based and the jobseeker uses mouse clicks to profess either no interest, average interest, or high interest. Ourparticipant uses these in a paper-based format in cases were there might be language difficulties and no interpreter is available. ","972, 976-7",using competency cards with her clients,
18,Migrants,Agent,"Previous work on technology in Public Employment Services and job market chances has focused on profiling systems that are in-tended for tasks such as assessing and classifying jobseekers. To Integrate into the local job market, migrants and refugees seek sup-port from the Public Employment Services (PES), but also non-profit,non-governmental organizations (herein referred to as third sector organizations, or TSOs). How do design visions for technologies to support jobseekers change when developed not under bureau-cratic rules but by people interacting directly and informally with jobseekers? We focus on the perspectives of TSO workers assisting migrants and refugees seeking support for their job search.Through interviews and a design fiction exercise, we investigate (1)the role of TSO workers, (2) factors beyond those used in profiling systems that they consider relevant, and (3) their ideal technology.We describe how TSO workers contextualize formal criteria used in profiling systems while prioritizing jobseekers’ personal interests and strengths. Based on our findings on existing tools and methods,and imagined future technologies, we propose a software-based project that expands existing job taxonomies into a coordinated resource combining job characteristics, required competencies, and soft skills to support multiple informational tools for jobseekers. 6.1 InterviewsThe interviews were summarized into four themes. Our participants described factors they take into consideration when assessing which job is suitable for the person they are advising and for assessing what their chances of finding a new job are. The interviews also focused on the approaches they use when working with clients.6.1.1 Using standard, formal criteria. TSO counselors work, to some extent, with and on the same factors that PES counselors and systems use: the opportunities and challenges afforded by age,knowledge of the German language, job experience, and education level. They also take into account the de-facto challenges posed by care obligations (real or perceived consequences on availability and flexibility) and religion (employer reluctance to hire Muslimwomen wearing a headscarf in customer-facing jobs such as retailor hospitality). In advising clients, our participants often face dilemmas. Oneexample is the ambiguous role of apprenticeships. On the one hand,apprenticeships are highly valued in the German job market that relies strongly on qualifications and their formal certification, and being in an apprenticeship can help the apprentice secure a longer-term residence permit [16, 28]. On the other hand, average appren-ticeship earnings are less than half of a full-time position at minimum wage [32, 36, 38], which deters many migrants and refugees who have to provide for their families, and jobseekers perceived as“too old” (beyond mid-20s) or holding a current residence permit with a short remaining duration may not even be considered by employers.6.1.2 Valuing qualifications beyond formal criteria. Once formal conditions are clear, the TSOs workers look for criteria for successful job search that are often not taken into consideration in ADM systems. These include so-called soft skills, especially the willingness to learn, and motivation.Participants mentioned communication skills and openness to-wards other people the most. When it comes to jobs with customer contact, several participants mentioned that their clients sometimes reject these jobs even if they have good communication skills due to experiences of racism. Others had rejected such jobs because they were frustrated by their slow progress in learning the German Language. One participant mentioned that jobs in accountancy were very popular with his clients for a while because these preferred a job with numbers instead of language. Some clients give up learn-ing German and decide to pursue jobs that are typically labeled as“low-skilled” and do not require language proficiency .Additional influencing factors that were mentioned include mo-tivation and willingness to learn more about jobs, as well as the mindset that one has towards job applications and work in general.One participant gave the following example: So when you approach this with an “I don’t care, the main thing is to find work-” attitude, yes of course, then you’re more likely to find jobs where you're completely interchangeable and replaceable.

Based on our findings on existing tools and methods,and imagined future technologies, we propose a software-based project that expands existing job taxonomies into a coordinated resource combining job characteristics, required competencies, and soft skills to support multiple informational tools for jobseekers. 6.1 InterviewsThe interviews were summarized into four themes. Our participants described factors they take into consideration when assessing which job is suitable for the person they are advising and for assessing what their chances of finding a new job are. The interviews also focused on the approaches they use when working with clients.6.1.1 Using standard, formal criteria. TSO counselors work, to some extent, with and on the same factors that PES counselors and systems use: the opportunities and challenges afforded by age,knowledge of the German language, job experience, and education level. They also take into account the de-facto challenges posed by care obligations (real or perceived consequences on availability and flexibility) and religion (employer reluctance to hire Muslimwomen wearing a headscarf in customer-facing jobs such as retailor hospitality). In advising clients, our participants often face dilemmas. Oneexample is the ambiguous role of apprenticeships. On the one hand,apprenticeships are highly valued in the German job market that relies strongly on qualifications and their formal certification, and being in an apprenticeship can help the apprentice secure a longer-term residence permit [16, 28]. On the other hand, average appren-ticeship earnings are less than half of a full-time position at minimum wage [32, 36, 38], which deters many migrants and refugees who have to provide for their families, and jobseekers perceived as“too old” (beyond mid-20s) or holding a current residence permit with a short remaining duration may not even be considered by employers.6.1.2 Valuing qualifications beyond formal criteria. Once formal conditions are clear, the TSOs workers look for criteria for successful job search that are often not taken into consideration in ADM systems. These include so-called soft skills, especially the willingness to learn, and motivation.Participants mentioned communication skills and openness to-wards other people the most. When it comes to jobs with customer contact, several participants mentioned that their clients sometimes reject these jobs even if they have good communication skills due to experiences of racism. Others had rejected such jobs because they were frustrated by their slow progress in learning the German Language. One participant mentioned that jobs in accountancy were very popular with his clients for a while because these preferred a job with numbers instead of language. Some clients give up learn-ing German and decide to pursue jobs that are typically labeled as“low-skilled” and do not require language proficiency .Additional influencing factors that were mentioned include mo-tivation and willingness to learn more about jobs, as well as the mindset that one has towards job applications and work in general.One participant gave the following example: So when you approach this with an “I don’t care, the main thing is to find work-” attitude, yes of course, then you’re more likely to find jobs where you're completely interchangeable and replaceable. Or if you instead somehow approach work with a desire and apply for jobs that you are interested in and so on.The ability to work in a team, friendliness, flexibility and resilience were deemed important as well. One of our participants mentioned that she asks her clients whether they like to work in-dividually or in groups and whether they prefer a more dynamic working environment or a more systematic one.Informal job experience, such as having helped out in a family car shop or having cared for children, was also valued by our par-ticipants. In the highly formalized German job market, informal job knowledge is usually insufficient to find employment, but can be a good starting point for choosing further steps. One participant gave the example of a Syrian woman who did not have any formal degree or apprenticeship, but had worked with special-needs children inSyria, so she was able to secure funding for training to become a nursing specialist. 6.1.3 Empowering jobseekers through information. Our participants mentioned that jobseekers need information and knowledge to enter the German job market. In this context, one phrase was mentioned in several interviews: “help for self-help” (German: “Hilfe Zur Selbsthilfe”). As one participant put it: “Not that we overburden him [a jobseeker] but that we offer him help where he needs it and there, what is so beautifully understood by this funny term empowerment, demand from him what he can also do himself.”Another participant compared the role of TSOs to guardrails for jobseekers:The idea is always [...] to try to empower the client to go the way themselves, supporting them with in-formation. [...]. And then it doesn’t matter whether the client is speeding on the left lane at 160 or creep-ing along the right lane at 60, but at least the rough direction is clear. And if they get too far off course,you’re the guardrail and can hopefully help them find their way back to the original course.This supporting information can take the form of answering questions related to the entire process of job search such as “Where Can I find a German course? How can I get funding? How do I get my certificates recognized? What are my legal rights?”. In particular when it comes to writing application letters, one of our participants mentioned the importance of empowerment, because employers value greatly the ability to work independently. One participant mentioned supporting jobseekers by informing them about labor laws, as she hopes to help them better understand both their own and their employer’s obligations. She mentioned that there are violations from both sides, such as turning up late for work, but also unlawful firing of people.It was mentioned that information available on jobs differs across professions, e.g. health sector jobs have good information available,while others do not. In many interviews the sheer number of existing types of jobs and the impossibility to provide information on all of them was mentioned as a problem. There are projects through which jobseekers can gain insight into different jobs by going to participating companies. Another way our participant support jobseekers is by organizing internships and by providing information through activities and events for networking or gettingadvice.Social capital is used in the sense of offering or disseminating information through social media channels or personal networks of the organization’s volunteers, by connecting the jobseeker to a person who works in a similar job, or by recommending job seekers to a potential employer. Jobseekers sometimes call their TSO advisor after a few months to tell them about their progress in a new job.Some of the organizations offer a type of mentoring for longer-term assistance in job search. The organizations also communicate with each other forming a wider network that allows them to refer job seekers to other organizations if their needs are not within the organization's competencies.The “help for self-help” principle is often applied for resumes.One of the organizations offers information events regarding job applications, as the structure and content of resumes may differ from those that are standard in jobseekers’ countries of origin.All organizations offer individual help with resume writing. Oneparticipant mentioned that in 80% of the cases, she helps clients make a new resume or alter their existing one. When she helps jobseekers with their resume, they sit in front of the computer together and she types, while the jobseekers tell her what they've done in their life, and they compare that to the existing resume and discuss. Her goal is to enable the jobseekers to use an online tool for resume building. Another participant who also uses online tools argued that resumes are “so complicated here in Germany, so strict.”One of the organizations has a link list with jobs in specific sectors,which they give to jobseekers once they have finished writing their resume.6.1.4 Exploring personal interests and strengths. One of the most important aspects of the counselling is the exploration of personal interests and strengths. Some jobseekers approach TSOs with a clear idea in mind, others look for guidance on suitable jobs. Theseare explored through different approaches, e.g. by asking about hobbies. One situation was described as follows:We asked him: Do you have any hobbies? Do you like to do anything? He couldn’t answer. But when we asked him, it turned out that he is very athletic, yes, he does a lot of sports. That was at least a point of contact. And we then agreed to move forward [...]that we said we would check out what vacancies there might be as a sports specialist. A similar approach was described by another participant: she described talking “about life in general” to find out what her clients’“true interests” are.All participants mentioned that jobseekers’ wishes are prioritized over suggestions from the counselor. One participant explicitly said “I definitely don’t say what job [...] is suitable, that’s up to them to decide,” and recommends doing an internship to get some deeper insight if there are doubts. If a person is interested in a job, then they look at job advertisements and the required skills and competencies for the job together. During one interview, it was mentioned that if jobseekers have a specific job they would like to pursue but cannot find employment due to reasons such as language skills, the counselor tries to find similar jobs. In one interview it was mentioned that the participant tried to use the online tests provided by the German PES but did not find them helpful:It’s not really intended for people who can’t speak German very well. [The tool’s output indicated simply that] he can work very independently, that he is very communicative and that he can react very well in conflict situations. But all of that, I would say, doesn’t point in a professional direction yet. She called the tests a “waste of time,” compared them to assess-ment center tests, and stated that, due to the way questions are formulated, a rich vocabulary in German is required. She also men-tioned that she tried to use tests on commercial websites but found the descriptions of jobs were too short to use during counselling. Instead, she started using competency cards with her clients, which are explained below. Participants described a range of methods and approaches that they use during job counseling to explore personal interests and strengths:Competency cards (German: Kompetenzkarten) [10, 11]: The Cards are available in different languages (among them Arabic,Farsi and Russian) and cover the areas of social, personal, technical and methodological competency (e.g. ability to work in a team).Each card includes a picture, a translation of the competency into different languages, and a description in plain language. There are also references to further information on the respective competency.Some of the cards have a red border which indicates that they can be specifically used in the profiling phase in the German PES. Theparticipant said she lets the jobseekers pick out three cards and explain why they think they have this competency.Videos: During several interviews, it was mentioned that there are videos of certain jobs that can be shown to jobseekers, such as videos about what an electrician or mechanic does at work.Life profile (German: Lebens Profil) [41]: This is a biography-oriented analysis aimed at taking a structured and comprehensive look at the past. It covers stages and activities alongside the career(e.g. volunteering and family work) and provides an overview of what has been learned in each case. Competencies can be derivedfrom the life profile. Women who come for counseling are asked to talk about their life experiences and prior activities, including their refugee experience, or divorce, for instance. The counselor then derives competencies from this. The TSO considers competencies to be transferable from private life to professional life. One of the participants said she encourages “women to distance themselves from outside pressure and focus on their inner self.”Photo interest test: (German: Foto-Interessen-Test) [64, 65]: Thisset of photographs contains around 130 photos of different jobs that are used as a basis for conversation with jobseekers. The origi-nal test is computer-based and the jobseeker uses mouse clicks to profess either no interest, average interest, or high interest. Ourparticipant uses these in a paper-based format in cases were there might be language difficulties and no interpreter is available.

35,SupportingMigrantJobSearch,constrainsAgent,TSOWorkers,"Previous work on technology in Public Employment Services and job market chances has focused on profiling systems that are in-tended for tasks such as assessing and classifying jobseekers.

[The tool’s output indicated simply that] he can work very independently, that he is very communicative and that he can react very well in conflict situations. But all of that, I would say, doesn’t point in a professional direction yet. She called the tests a “waste of time,” compared them to assess-ment center tests, and stated that, due to the way questions are formulated, a rich vocabulary in German is required. She also men-tioned that she tried to use tests on commercial websites but found the descriptions of jobs were too short to use during counselling. Instead, she started using competency cards with her clients, which are explained below. Participants described a range of methods and approaches that they use during job counseling to explore personal interests and strengths:Competency cards (German: Kompetenzkarten) [10, 11]: The Cards are available in different languages (among them Arabic,Farsi and Russian) and cover the areas of social, personal, technical and methodological competency (e.g. ability to work in a team).Each card includes a picture, a translation of the competency into different languages, and a description in plain language. There are also references to further information on the respective competency.Some of the cards have a red border which indicates that they can be specifically used in the profiling phase in the German PES. Theparticipant said she lets the jobseekers pick out three cards and explain why they think they have this competency.Videos: During several interviews, it was mentioned that there are videos of certain jobs that can be shown to jobseekers, such as videos about what an electrician or mechanic does at work.Life profile (German: Lebens Profil) [41]: This is a biography-oriented analysis aimed at taking a structured and comprehensive look at the past. It covers stages and activities alongside the career(e.g. volunteering and family work) and provides an overview of what has been learned in each case. Competencies can be derivedfrom the life profile. Women who come for counseling are asked to talk about their life experiences and prior activities, including their refugee experience, or divorce, for instance. The counselor then derives competencies from this. The TSO considers competencies to be transferable from private life to professional life. One of the participants said she encourages “women to distance themselves from outside pressure and focus on their inner self.”Photo interest test: (German: Foto-Interessen-Test) [64, 65]: Thisset of photographs contains around 130 photos of different jobs that are used as a basis for conversation with jobseekers. The origi-nal test is computer-based and the jobseeker uses mouse clicks to profess either no interest, average interest, or high interest.

37,Racism,constrainsAgent,Migrants,"Previous work on technology in Public Employment Services and job market chances has focused on profiling systems that are in-tended for tasks such as assessing and classifying jobseekers. To Integrate into the local job market, migrants and refugees seek sup-port from the Public Employment Services (PES), but also non-profit,non-governmental organizations (herein referred to as third sector organizations, or TSOs). How do design visions for technologies to support jobseekers change when developed not under bureau-cratic rules but by people interacting directly and informally with jobseekers? We focus on the perspectives of TSO workers assisting migrants and refugees seeking support for their job search.Through interviews and a design fiction exercise, we investigate (1)the role of TSO workers, (2) factors beyond those used in profiling systems that they consider relevant, and (3) their ideal technology.We describe how TSO workers contextualize formal criteria used in profiling systems while prioritizing jobseekers’ personal interests and strengths. Based on our findings on existing tools and methods,and imagined future technologies, we propose a software-based project that expands existing job taxonomies into a coordinated resource combining job characteristics, required competencies, and soft skills to support multiple informational tools for jobseekers. 6.1 InterviewsThe interviews were summarized into four themes. Our participants described factors they take into consideration when assessing which job is suitable for the person they are advising and for assessing what their chances of finding a new job are. The interviews also focused on the approaches they use when working with clients.6.1.1 Using standard, formal criteria. TSO counselors work, to some extent, with and on the same factors that PES counselors and systems use: the opportunities and challenges afforded by age,knowledge of the German language, job experience, and education level. They also take into account the de-facto challenges posed by care obligations (real or perceived consequences on availability and flexibility) and religion (employer reluctance to hire Muslimwomen wearing a headscarf in customer-facing jobs such as retailor hospitality). In advising clients, our participants often face dilemmas. Oneexample is the ambiguous role of apprenticeships. On the one hand,apprenticeships are highly valued in the German job market that relies strongly on qualifications and their formal certification, and being in an apprenticeship can help the apprentice secure a longer-term residence permit [16, 28]. On the other hand, average appren-ticeship earnings are less than half of a full-time position at minimum wage [32, 36, 38], which deters many migrants and refugees who have to provide for their families, and jobseekers perceived as“too old” (beyond mid-20s) or holding a current residence permit with a short remaining duration may not even be considered by employers.6.1.2 Valuing qualifications beyond formal criteria. Once formal conditions are clear, the TSOs workers look for criteria for successful job search that are often not taken into consideration in ADM systems. These include so-called soft skills, especially the willingness to learn, and motivation.Participants mentioned communication skills and openness to-wards other people the most. When it comes to jobs with customer contact, several participants mentioned that their clients sometimes reject these jobs even if they have good communication skills due to experiences of racism. Others had rejected such jobs because they were frustrated by their slow progress in learning the German Language. One participant mentioned that jobs in accountancy were very popular with his clients for a while because these preferred a job with numbers instead of language. Some clients give up learn-ing German and decide to pursue jobs that are typically labeled as“low-skilled” and do not require language proficiency .Additional influencing factors that were mentioned include mo-tivation and willingness to learn more about jobs, as well as the mindset that one has towards job applications and work in general.One participant gave the following example: So when you approach this with an “I don’t care, the main thing is to find work-” attitude, yes of course, then you’re more likely to find jobs where you're completely interchangeable and replaceable. Or if you instead somehow approach work with a desire and apply for jobs that you are interested in and so on.The ability to work in a team, friendliness, flexibility and resilience were deemed important as well. One of our participants mentioned that she asks her clients whether they like to work in-dividually or in groups and whether they prefer a more dynamic working environment or a more systematic one.Informal job experience, such as having helped out in a family car shop or having cared for children, was also valued by our par-ticipants. In the highly formalized German job market, informal job knowledge is usually insufficient to find employment, but can be a good starting point for choosing further steps. One participant gave the example of a Syrian woman who did not have any formal degree or apprenticeship, but had worked with special-needs children inSyria, so she was able to secure funding for training to become a nursing specialist. 6.1.3 Empowering jobseekers through information. Our participants mentioned that jobseekers need information and knowledge to enter the German job market. In this context, one phrase was mentioned in several interviews: “help for self-help” (German: “Hilfe Zur Selbsthilfe”). As one participant put it: “Not that we overburden him [a jobseeker] but that we offer him help where he needs it and there, what is so beautifully understood by this funny term empowerment, demand from him what he can also do himself.”Another participant compared the role of TSOs to guardrails for jobseekers:The idea is always [...] to try to empower the client to go the way themselves, supporting them with in-formation. [...]. And then it doesn’t matter whether the client is speeding on the left lane at 160 or creep-ing along the right lane at 60, but at least the rough direction is clear. And if they get too far off course,you’re the guardrail and can hopefully help them find their way back to the original course.This supporting information can take the form of answering questions related to the entire process of job search such as “Where Can I find a German course? How can I get funding? How do I get my certificates recognized? What are my legal rights?”. In particular when it comes to writing application letters, one of our participants mentioned the importance of empowerment, because employers value greatly the ability to work independently. One participant mentioned supporting jobseekers by informing them about labor laws, as she hopes to help them better understand both their own and their employer’s obligations. She mentioned that there are violations from both sides, such as turning up late for work, but also unlawful firing of people.It was mentioned that information available on jobs differs across professions, e.g. health sector jobs have good information available,while others do not. In many interviews the sheer number of existing types of jobs and the impossibility to provide information on all of them was mentioned as a problem. There are projects through which jobseekers can gain insight into different jobs by going to participating companies. Another way our participant support jobseekers is by organizing internships and by providing information through activities and events for networking or gettingadvice.Social capital is used in the sense of offering or disseminating information through social media channels or personal networks of the organization’s volunteers, by connecting the jobseeker to a person who works in a similar job, or by recommending job seekers to a potential employer. Jobseekers sometimes call their TSO advisor after a few months to tell them about their progress in a new job.Some of the organizations offer a type of mentoring for longer-term assistance in job search. The organizations also communicate with each other forming a wider network that allows them to refer job seekers to other organizations if their needs are not within the organization's competencies.The “help for self-help” principle is often applied for resumes.One of the organizations offers information events regarding job applications, as the structure and content of resumes may differ from those that are standard in jobseekers’ countries of origin.All organizations offer individual help with resume writing. Oneparticipant mentioned that in 80% of the cases, she helps clients make a new resume or alter their existing one. When she helps jobseekers with their resume, they sit in front of the computer together and she types, while the jobseekers tell her what they've done in their life, and they compare that to the existing resume and discuss. Her goal is to enable the jobseekers to use an online tool for resume building. Another participant who also uses online tools argued that resumes are “so complicated here in Germany, so strict.”One of the organizations has a link list with jobs in specific sectors,which they give to jobseekers once they have finished writing their resume.6.1.4 Exploring personal interests and strengths. One of the most important aspects of the counselling is the exploration of personal interests and strengths. Some jobseekers approach TSOs with a clear idea in mind, others look for guidance on suitable jobs. Theseare explored through different approaches, e.g. by asking about hobbies. One situation was described as follows:We asked him: Do you have any hobbies? Do you like to do anything? He couldn’t answer. But when we asked him, it turned out that he is very athletic, yes, he does a lot of sports. That was at least a point of contact. And we then agreed to move forward [...]that we said we would check out what vacancies there might be as a sports specialist. A similar approach was described by another participant: she described talking “about life in general” to find out what her clients’“true interests” are.All participants mentioned that jobseekers’ wishes are prioritized over suggestions from the counselor. One participant explicitly said “I definitely don’t say what job [...] is suitable, that’s up to them to decide,” and recommends doing an internship to get some deeper insight if there are doubts. If a person is interested in a job, then they look at job advertisements and the required skills and competencies for the job together. During one interview, it was mentioned that if jobseekers have a specific job they would like to pursue but cannot find employment due to reasons such as language skills, the counselor tries to find similar jobs. In one interview it was mentioned that the participant tried to use the online tests provided by the German PES but did not find them helpful:It’s not really intended for people who can’t speak German very well.

Jobseekers sometimes call their TSO advisor after a few months to tell them about their progress in a new job.Some of the organizations offer a type of mentoring for longer-term assistance in job search. The organizations also communicate with each other forming a wider network that allows them to refer job seekers to other organizations if their needs are not within the organization's competencies.The “help for self-help” principle is often applied for resumes.One of the organizations offers information events regarding job applications, as the structure and content of resumes may differ from those that are standard in jobseekers’ countries of origin.All organizations offer individual help with resume writing. Oneparticipant mentioned that in 80% of the cases, she helps clients make a new resume or alter their existing one. When she helps jobseekers with their resume, they sit in front of the computer together and she types, while the jobseekers tell her what they've done in their life, and they compare that to the existing resume and discuss. Her goal is to enable the jobseekers to use an online tool for resume building. Another participant who also uses online tools argued that resumes are “so complicated here in Germany, so strict.”One of the organizations has a link list with jobs in specific sectors,which they give to jobseekers once they have finished writing their resume.6.1.4 Exploring personal interests and strengths. One of the most important aspects of the counselling is the exploration of personal interests and strengths. Some jobseekers approach TSOs with a clear idea in mind, others look for guidance on suitable jobs. Theseare explored through different approaches, e.g. by asking about hobbies. One situation was described as follows:We asked him: Do you have any hobbies? Do you like to do anything? He couldn’t answer. But when we asked him, it turned out that he is very athletic, yes, he does a lot of sports. That was at least a point of contact. And we then agreed to move forward [...]that we said we would check out what vacancies there might be as a sports specialist. A similar approach was described by another participant: she described talking “about life in general” to find out what her clients’“true interests” are.All participants mentioned that jobseekers’ wishes are prioritized over suggestions from the counselor. One participant explicitly said “I definitely don’t say what job [...] is suitable, that’s up to them to decide,” and recommends doing an internship to get some deeper insight if there are doubts. If a person is interested in a job, then they look at job advertisements and the required skills and competencies for the job together. During one interview, it was mentioned that if jobseekers have a specific job they would like to pursue but cannot find employment due to reasons such as language skills, the counselor tries to find similar jobs. In one interview it was mentioned that the participant tried to use the online tests provided by the German PES but did not find them helpful:It’s not really intended for people who can’t speak German very well. [The tool’s output indicated simply that] he can work very independently, that he is very communicative and that he can react very well in conflict situations. But all of that, I would say, doesn’t point in a professional direction yet. She called the tests a “waste of time,” compared them to assess-ment center tests, and stated that, due to the way questions are formulated, a rich vocabulary in German is required. She also men-tioned that she tried to use tests on commercial websites but found the descriptions of jobs were too short to use during counselling. Instead, she started using competency cards with her clients, which are explained below. Participants described a range of methods and approaches that they use during job counseling to explore personal interests and strengths:Competency cards (German: Kompetenzkarten) [10, 11]: The Cards are available in different languages (among them Arabic,Farsi and Russian) and cover the areas of social, personal, technical and methodological competency (e.g. ability to work in a team).Each card includes a picture, a translation of the competency into different languages, and a description in plain language. There are also references to further information on the respective competency.Some of the cards have a red border which indicates that they can be specifically used in the profiling phase in the German PES. Theparticipant said she lets the jobseekers pick out three cards and explain why they think they have this competency.Videos: During several interviews, it was mentioned that there are videos of certain jobs that can be shown to jobseekers, such as videos about what an electrician or mechanic does at work.Life profile (German: Lebens Profil) [41]: This is a biography-oriented analysis aimed at taking a structured and comprehensive look at the past. It covers stages and activities alongside the career(e.g. volunteering and family work) and provides an overview of what has been learned in each case. Competencies can be derivedfrom the life profile. Women who come for counseling are asked to talk about their life experiences and prior activities, including their refugee experience, or divorce, for instance. The counselor then derives competencies from this. The TSO considers competencies to be transferable from private life to professional life. One of the participants said she encourages “women to distance themselves from outside pressure and focus on their inner self.”Photo interest test: (German: Foto-Interessen-Test) [64, 65]: Thisset of photographs contains around 130 photos of different jobs that are used as a basis for conversation with jobseekers. The origi-nal test is computer-based and the jobseeker uses mouse clicks to profess either no interest, average interest, or high interest. Ourparticipant uses these in a paper-based format in cases were there might be language difficulties and no interpreter is available.

40,SeekingGuidance,constrainsAgent,Migrants,"Previous work on technology in Public Employment Services and job market chances has focused on profiling systems that are in-tended for tasks such as assessing and classifying jobseekers. To Integrate into the local job market, migrants and refugees seek sup-port from the Public Employment Services (PES), but also non-profit,non-governmental organizations (herein referred to as third sector organizations, or TSOs). How do design visions for technologies to support jobseekers change when developed not under bureau-cratic rules but by people interacting directly and informally with jobseekers? We focus on the perspectives of TSO workers assisting migrants and refugees seeking support for their job search.Through interviews and a design fiction exercise, we investigate (1)the role of TSO workers, (2) factors beyond those used in profiling systems that they consider relevant, and (3) their ideal technology.We describe how TSO workers contextualize formal criteria used in profiling systems while prioritizing jobseekers’ personal interests and strengths. Based on our findings on existing tools and methods,and imagined future technologies, we propose a software-based project that expands existing job taxonomies into a coordinated resource combining job characteristics, required competencies, and soft skills to support multiple informational tools for jobseekers. 6.1 InterviewsThe interviews were summarized into four themes. Our participants described factors they take into consideration when assessing which job is suitable for the person they are advising and for assessing what their chances of finding a new job are. The interviews also focused on the approaches they use when working with clients.6.1.1 Using standard, formal criteria. TSO counselors work, to some extent, with and on the same factors that PES counselors and systems use: the opportunities and challenges afforded by age,knowledge of the German language, job experience, and education level. They also take into account the de-facto challenges posed by care obligations (real or perceived consequences on availability and flexibility) and religion (employer reluctance to hire Muslimwomen wearing a headscarf in customer-facing jobs such as retailor hospitality). In advising clients, our participants often face dilemmas. Oneexample is the ambiguous role of apprenticeships. On the one hand,apprenticeships are highly valued in the German job market that relies strongly on qualifications and their formal certification, and being in an apprenticeship can help the apprentice secure a longer-term residence permit [16, 28]. On the other hand, average appren-ticeship earnings are less than half of a full-time position at minimum wage [32, 36, 38], which deters many migrants and refugees who have to provide for their families, and jobseekers perceived as“too old” (beyond mid-20s) or holding a current residence permit with a short remaining duration may not even be considered by employers.6.1.2 Valuing qualifications beyond formal criteria. Once formal conditions are clear, the TSOs workers look for criteria for successful job search that are often not taken into consideration in ADM systems. These include so-called soft skills, especially the willingness to learn, and motivation.Participants mentioned communication skills and openness to-wards other people the most. When it comes to jobs with customer contact, several participants mentioned that their clients sometimes reject these jobs even if they have good communication skills due to experiences of racism. Others had rejected such jobs because they were frustrated by their slow progress in learning the German Language. One participant mentioned that jobs in accountancy were very popular with his clients for a while because these preferred a job with numbers instead of language. Some clients give up learn-ing German and decide to pursue jobs that are typically labeled as“low-skilled” and do not require language proficiency .Additional influencing factors that were mentioned include mo-tivation and willingness to learn more about jobs, as well as the mindset that one has towards job applications and work in general.One participant gave the following example: So when you approach this with an “I don’t care, the main thing is to find work-” attitude, yes of course, then you’re more likely to find jobs where you're completely interchangeable and replaceable. Or if you instead somehow approach work with a desire and apply for jobs that you are interested in and so on.The ability to work in a team, friendliness, flexibility and resilience were deemed important as well. One of our participants mentioned that she asks her clients whether they like to work in-dividually or in groups and whether they prefer a more dynamic working environment or a more systematic one.Informal job experience, such as having helped out in a family car shop or having cared for children, was also valued by our par-ticipants. In the highly formalized German job market, informal job knowledge is usually insufficient to find employment, but can be a good starting point for choosing further steps. One participant gave the example of a Syrian woman who did not have any formal degree or apprenticeship, but had worked with special-needs children inSyria, so she was able to secure funding for training to become a nursing specialist. 6.1.3 Empowering jobseekers through information. Our participants mentioned that jobseekers need information and knowledge to enter the German job market. In this context, one phrase was mentioned in several interviews: “help for self-help” (German: “Hilfe Zur Selbsthilfe”). As one participant put it: “Not that we overburden him [a jobseeker] but that we offer him help where he needs it and there, what is so beautifully understood by this funny term empowerment, demand from him what he can also do himself.”Another participant compared the role of TSOs to guardrails for jobseekers:The idea is always [...] to try to empower the client to go the way themselves, supporting them with in-formation. [...]. And then it doesn’t matter whether the client is speeding on the left lane at 160 or creep-ing along the right lane at 60, but at least the rough direction is clear. And if they get too far off course,you’re the guardrail and can hopefully help them find their way back to the original course.This supporting information can take the form of answering questions related to the entire process of job search such as “Where Can I find a German course? How can I get funding? How do I get my certificates recognized? What are my legal rights?”. In particular when it comes to writing application letters, one of our participants mentioned the importance of empowerment, because employers value greatly the ability to work independently. One participant mentioned supporting jobseekers by informing them about labor laws, as she hopes to help them better understand both their own and their employer’s obligations. She mentioned that there are violations from both sides, such as turning up late for work, but also unlawful firing of people.It was mentioned that information available on jobs differs across professions, e.g. health sector jobs have good information available,while others do not. In many interviews the sheer number of existing types of jobs and the impossibility to provide information on all of them was mentioned as a problem. There are projects through which jobseekers can gain insight into different jobs by going to participating companies. Another way our participant support jobseekers is by organizing internships and by providing information through activities and events for networking or gettingadvice.Social capital is used in the sense of offering or disseminating information through social media channels or personal networks of the organization’s volunteers, by connecting the jobseeker to a person who works in a similar job, or by recommending job seekers to a potential employer.

One of our participants mentioned that she asks her clients whether they like to work in-dividually or in groups and whether they prefer a more dynamic working environment or a more systematic one.Informal job experience, such as having helped out in a family car shop or having cared for children, was also valued by our par-ticipants. In the highly formalized German job market, informal job knowledge is usually insufficient to find employment, but can be a good starting point for choosing further steps. One participant gave the example of a Syrian woman who did not have any formal degree or apprenticeship, but had worked with special-needs children inSyria, so she was able to secure funding for training to become a nursing specialist. 6.1.3 Empowering jobseekers through information. Our participants mentioned that jobseekers need information and knowledge to enter the German job market. In this context, one phrase was mentioned in several interviews: “help for self-help” (German: “Hilfe Zur Selbsthilfe”). As one participant put it: “Not that we overburden him [a jobseeker] but that we offer him help where he needs it and there, what is so beautifully understood by this funny term empowerment, demand from him what he can also do himself.”Another participant compared the role of TSOs to guardrails for jobseekers:The idea is always [...] to try to empower the client to go the way themselves, supporting them with in-formation. [...]. And then it doesn’t matter whether the client is speeding on the left lane at 160 or creep-ing along the right lane at 60, but at least the rough direction is clear. And if they get too far off course,you’re the guardrail and can hopefully help them find their way back to the original course.This supporting information can take the form of answering questions related to the entire process of job search such as “Where Can I find a German course? How can I get funding? How do I get my certificates recognized? What are my legal rights?”. In particular when it comes to writing application letters, one of our participants mentioned the importance of empowerment, because employers value greatly the ability to work independently. One participant mentioned supporting jobseekers by informing them about labor laws, as she hopes to help them better understand both their own and their employer’s obligations. She mentioned that there are violations from both sides, such as turning up late for work, but also unlawful firing of people.It was mentioned that information available on jobs differs across professions, e.g. health sector jobs have good information available,while others do not. In many interviews the sheer number of existing types of jobs and the impossibility to provide information on all of them was mentioned as a problem. There are projects through which jobseekers can gain insight into different jobs by going to participating companies. Another way our participant support jobseekers is by organizing internships and by providing information through activities and events for networking or gettingadvice.Social capital is used in the sense of offering or disseminating information through social media channels or personal networks of the organization’s volunteers, by connecting the jobseeker to a person who works in a similar job, or by recommending job seekers to a potential employer. Jobseekers sometimes call their TSO advisor after a few months to tell them about their progress in a new job.Some of the organizations offer a type of mentoring for longer-term assistance in job search. The organizations also communicate with each other forming a wider network that allows them to refer job seekers to other organizations if their needs are not within the organization's competencies.The “help for self-help” principle is often applied for resumes.One of the organizations offers information events regarding job applications, as the structure and content of resumes may differ from those that are standard in jobseekers’ countries of origin.All organizations offer individual help with resume writing. Oneparticipant mentioned that in 80% of the cases, she helps clients make a new resume or alter their existing one. When she helps jobseekers with their resume, they sit in front of the computer together and she types, while the jobseekers tell her what they've done in their life, and they compare that to the existing resume and discuss. Her goal is to enable the jobseekers to use an online tool for resume building. Another participant who also uses online tools argued that resumes are “so complicated here in Germany, so strict.”One of the organizations has a link list with jobs in specific sectors,which they give to jobseekers once they have finished writing their resume.6.1.4 Exploring personal interests and strengths. One of the most important aspects of the counselling is the exploration of personal interests and strengths. Some jobseekers approach TSOs with a clear idea in mind, others look for guidance on suitable jobs. Theseare explored through different approaches, e.g. by asking about hobbies. One situation was described as follows:We asked him: Do you have any hobbies? Do you like to do anything? He couldn’t answer. But when we asked him, it turned out that he is very athletic, yes, he does a lot of sports. That was at least a point of contact. And we then agreed to move forward [...]that we said we would check out what vacancies there might be as a sports specialist. A similar approach was described by another participant: she described talking “about life in general” to find out what her clients’“true interests” are.All participants mentioned that jobseekers’ wishes are prioritized over suggestions from the counselor. One participant explicitly said “I definitely don’t say what job [...] is suitable, that’s up to them to decide,” and recommends doing an internship to get some deeper insight if there are doubts. If a person is interested in a job, then they look at job advertisements and the required skills and competencies for the job together. During one interview, it was mentioned that if jobseekers have a specific job they would like to pursue but cannot find employment due to reasons such as language skills, the counselor tries to find similar jobs. In one interview it was mentioned that the participant tried to use the online tests provided by the German PES but did not find them helpful:It’s not really intended for people who can’t speak German very well. [The tool’s output indicated simply that] he can work very independently, that he is very communicative and that he can react very well in conflict situations. But all of that, I would say, doesn’t point in a professional direction yet. She called the tests a “waste of time,” compared them to assess-ment center tests, and stated that, due to the way questions are formulated, a rich vocabulary in German is required. She also men-tioned that she tried to use tests on commercial websites but found the descriptions of jobs were too short to use during counselling. Instead, she started using competency cards with her clients, which are explained below. Participants described a range of methods and approaches that they use during job counseling to explore personal interests and strengths:Competency cards (German: Kompetenzkarten) [10, 11]: The Cards are available in different languages (among them Arabic,Farsi and Russian) and cover the areas of social, personal, technical and methodological competency (e.g. ability to work in a team).Each card includes a picture, a translation of the competency into different languages, and a description in plain language. There are also references to further information on the respective competency.Some of the cards have a red border which indicates that they can be specifically used in the profiling phase in the German PES. Theparticipant said she lets the jobseekers pick out three cards and explain why they think they have this competency.Videos: During several interviews, it was mentioned that there are videos of certain jobs that can be shown to jobseekers, such as videos about what an electrician or mechanic does at work.Life profile (German: Lebens Profil) [41]: This is a biography-oriented analysis aimed at taking a structured and comprehensive look at the past. It covers stages and activities alongside the career(e.g. volunteering and family work) and provides an overview of what has been learned in each case. Competencies can be derivedfrom the life profile. Women who come for counseling are asked to talk about their life experiences and prior activities, including their refugee experience, or divorce, for instance. The counselor then derives competencies from this. The TSO considers competencies to be transferable from private life to professional life. One of the participants said she encourages “women to distance themselves from outside pressure and focus on their inner self.”Photo interest test: (German: Foto-Interessen-Test) [64, 65]: Thisset of photographs contains around 130 photos of different jobs that are used as a basis for conversation with jobseekers. The origi-nal test is computer-based and the jobseeker uses mouse clicks to profess either no interest, average interest, or high interest. Ourparticipant uses these in a paper-based format in cases were there might be language difficulties and no interpreter is available.

43,CompetencyCardDeployment,reflectsPrecept,BiographyOrientedAnalysis,"Previous work on technology in Public Employment Services and job market chances has focused on profiling systems that are in-tended for tasks such as assessing and classifying jobseekers. To Integrate into the local job market, migrants and refugees seek sup-port from the Public Employment Services (PES), but also non-profit,non-governmental organizations (herein referred to as third sector organizations, or TSOs). How do design visions for technologies to support jobseekers change when developed not under bureau-cratic rules but by people interacting directly and informally with jobseekers? We focus on the perspectives of TSO workers assisting migrants and refugees seeking support for their job search.Through interviews and a design fiction exercise, we investigate (1)the role of TSO workers, (2) factors beyond those used in profiling systems that they consider relevant, and (3) their ideal technology.We describe how TSO workers contextualize formal criteria used in profiling systems while prioritizing jobseekers’ personal interests and strengths. Based on our findings on existing tools and methods,and imagined future technologies, we propose a software-based project that expands existing job taxonomies into a coordinated resource combining job characteristics, required competencies, and soft skills to support multiple informational tools for jobseekers. 6.1 InterviewsThe interviews were summarized into four themes. Our participants described factors they take into consideration when assessing which job is suitable for the person they are advising and for assessing what their chances of finding a new job are. The interviews also focused on the approaches they use when working with clients.6.1.1 Using standard, formal criteria. TSO counselors work, to some extent, with and on the same factors that PES counselors and systems use: the opportunities and challenges afforded by age,knowledge of the German language, job experience, and education level. They also take into account the de-facto challenges posed by care obligations (real or perceived consequences on availability and flexibility) and religion (employer reluctance to hire Muslimwomen wearing a headscarf in customer-facing jobs such as retailor hospitality). In advising clients, our participants often face dilemmas. Oneexample is the ambiguous role of apprenticeships. On the one hand,apprenticeships are highly valued in the German job market that relies strongly on qualifications and their formal certification, and being in an apprenticeship can help the apprentice secure a longer-term residence permit [16, 28]. On the other hand, average appren-ticeship earnings are less than half of a full-time position at minimum wage [32, 36, 38], which deters many migrants and refugees who have to provide for their families, and jobseekers perceived as“too old” (beyond mid-20s) or holding a current residence permit with a short remaining duration may not even be considered by employers.6.1.2 Valuing qualifications beyond formal criteria. Once formal conditions are clear, the TSOs workers look for criteria for successful job search that are often not taken into consideration in ADM systems. These include so-called soft skills, especially the willingness to learn, and motivation.Participants mentioned communication skills and openness to-wards other people the most. When it comes to jobs with customer contact, several participants mentioned that their clients sometimes reject these jobs even if they have good communication skills due to experiences of racism. Others had rejected such jobs because they were frustrated by their slow progress in learning the German Language. One participant mentioned that jobs in accountancy were very popular with his clients for a while because these preferred a job with numbers instead of language. Some clients give up learn-ing German and decide to pursue jobs that are typically labeled as“low-skilled” and do not require language proficiency .Additional influencing factors that were mentioned include mo-tivation and willingness to learn more about jobs, as well as the mindset that one has towards job applications and work in general.One participant gave the following example: So when you approach this with an “I don’t care, the main thing is to find work-” attitude, yes of course, then you’re more likely to find jobs where you're completely interchangeable and replaceable. Or if you instead somehow approach work with a desire and apply for jobs that you are interested in and so on.The ability to work in a team, friendliness, flexibility and resilience were deemed important as well.
