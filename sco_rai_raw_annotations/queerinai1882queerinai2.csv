9,FailureOfSafety,Perceived_Problem,"As conferences moved online in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Queer in AI organizers noted a series of operational failures that could cause queer attendees to feel unsafe or unwelcome. Registration platforms demanded attendees to provide their legal names, thus potentially deadnaming them; the use of pronoun badges for speakers and attendees was rarely encouraged, or platforms did not support displaying pronouns; virtual chat software blocked common queer terms such as “queer” or “lesbian”, thus preventingqueer attendees from communicating freely. Queer in AI organizers worked closely with many conferences to resolve these issues, as they had in prior settings (§4.2), and ultimately decided to collect recommendations aimed at highlighting best practices to ensure safety, privacy, and accessibility for queer attendees at academic conferences in AI in a collected guidance document.These recommendations began based on existing best practices and experience with conference organizers, but were refined through extensive iterative feedback from members of Queer inAI and other affinity groups, incorporating many opinions and ultimately achieving consensus among a broad group of contribu-tors. The guide has recently been expanded to also cover in-person events as conferences move to hybrid or in-person formats.This queer advocacy to improve inclusivity covers two aspects:improving queer safety and increasing queer representation.4.3.1 Improving Queer Safety: As in any public space, queerconference-goers might face discrimination based on their gender and sexual orientation. Therefore, it is paramount for attendees to be able to control what information they wish to disclose to the organizers and attendees of a conference. Queer in AIadvocates mechanisms to (i) respect attendees’ identities by collecting gender and pronoun information in a manner that does not misrepresent or erase queer identities, by creating forms with inclusive gender categories and disclosing the data usage [106] (ii) minimize the amount of personal information queer individuals have to disclose [7] (for example, only collecting legal name when absolutely necessary, and using responses about the gender and sexuality of attendees only for statistical purposes and in anonymized form); and (iii) ensure that mechanisms to report disruptive or harmful behaviors are swift and effective. Queer in AI recommends adopting a code of conduct (e.g., [100, 132]) to not only establish communication norms, but also describe how policy violations are handled [39].4.3.2 Increasing Queer Representation and Participation: Queer researchers' needs are regularly ignored in many aspects of the research community: challenges include lack of academic support, hostility from colleagues and advisors, inflexible name change policies, lack of representation in the research itself, and more [21].Stronger inclusion efforts, both for representation and participa-tion, can work towards addressing a lack of queer community and role models [109]. To increase representation, Queer in AI strongly encourages conference organizers to invite queer keynote speakers and panelists, prioritizing those from marginalized backgrounds(e.g., BIPOC or non-cisgender) [40]. Queer in AI recommends fair and equal compensation based on effort rather than seniority for all speakers [52, 103]. As noted in previous sections, financial accessibility and a lack of community were the main barriers for queerfolks to feel included at conferences. Queer in AI strongly advocates setting up spaces for queer folks to network and socialize with pri-vacy measures and also providing subsidies for queer researchers to attend virtual or in-person events.4.3.3 Critical Reflection. This guide and advocacy are not without their limitations. Most recommendations are still focused on vir-tual spaces and currently written guide lacks in-depth accessibility recommendations. Queer in AI needs to collaborate with disabled folks with a wider range of disabilities to document best practices regarding accessibility accommodations. Most significantly, despite organizers' efforts the guide has seen relatively modest adoption.",1090,a series of operational failures [...] to feel safe or unwelcome,

32,DataCollection,reflectsPrecept,RespectForIdentities,"As conferences moved online in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Queer in AI organizers noted a series of operational failures that could cause queer attendees to feel unsafe or unwelcome. Registration platforms demanded attendees to provide their legal names, thus potentially deadnaming them; the use of pronoun badges for speakers and attendees was rarely encouraged, or platforms did not support displaying pronouns; virtual chat software blocked common queer terms such as “queer” or “lesbian”, thus preventingqueer attendees from communicating freely. Queer in AI organizers worked closely with many conferences to resolve these issues, as they had in prior settings (§4.2), and ultimately decided to collect recommendations aimed at highlighting best practices to ensure safety, privacy, and accessibility for queer attendees at academic conferences in AI in a collected guidance document.These recommendations began based on existing best practices and experience with conference organizers, but were refined through extensive iterative feedback from members of Queer inAI and other affinity groups, incorporating many opinions and ultimately achieving consensus among a broad group of contribu-tors. The guide has recently been expanded to also cover in-person events as conferences move to hybrid or in-person formats.This queer advocacy to improve inclusivity covers two aspects:improving queer safety and increasing queer representation.4.3.1 Improving Queer Safety: As in any public space, queerconference-goers might face discrimination based on their gender and sexual orientation. Therefore, it is paramount for attendees to be able to control what information they wish to disclose to the organizers and attendees of a conference. Queer in AIadvocates mechanisms to (i) respect attendees’ identities by collecting gender and pronoun information in a manner that does not misrepresent or erase queer identities, by creating forms with inclusive gender categories and disclosing the data usage [106] (ii) minimize the amount of personal information queer individuals have to disclose [7] (for example, only collecting legal name when absolutely necessary, and using responses about the gender and sexuality of attendees only for statistical purposes and in anonymized form); and (iii) ensure that mechanisms to report disruptive or harmful behaviors are swift and effective. Queer in AI recommends adopting a code of conduct (e.g., [100, 132]) to not only establish communication norms, but also describe how policy violations are handled [39].4.3.2 Increasing Queer Representation and Participation: Queer researchers' needs are regularly ignored in many aspects of the research community: challenges include lack of academic support, hostility from colleagues and advisors, inflexible name change policies, lack of representation in the research itself, and more [21].Stronger inclusion efforts, both for representation and participa-tion, can work towards addressing a lack of queer community and role models [109]. To increase representation, Queer in AI strongly encourages conference organizers to invite queer keynote speakers and panelists, prioritizing those from marginalized backgrounds(e.g., BIPOC or non-cisgender) [40]. Queer in AI recommends fair and equal compensation based on effort rather than seniority for all speakers [52, 103]. As noted in previous sections, financial accessibility and a lack of community were the main barriers for queerfolks to feel included at conferences. Queer in AI strongly advocates setting up spaces for queer folks to network and socialize with pri-vacy measures and also providing subsidies for queer researchers to attend virtual or in-person events.4.3.3 Critical Reflection. This guide and advocacy are not without their limitations. Most recommendations are still focused on vir-tual spaces and currently written guide lacks in-depth accessibility recommendations. Queer in AI needs to collaborate with disabled folks with a wider range of disabilities to document best practices regarding accessibility accommodations. Most significantly, despite organizers' efforts the guide has seen relatively modest adoption.",1090,"respect attendees’ identities by collecting gender and pronoun information in a manner that does not misrepresent or erase queer identities,  by creating forms with inclusive gender categories and disclosing the data usage"
