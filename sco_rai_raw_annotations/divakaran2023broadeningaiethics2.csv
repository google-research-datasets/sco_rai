9,AI,Agent,"In this section, we will mostly consider Natyashastra as a running illustration to put forth the unique aspects that the Indian arts canconvey in the context of ethical AI system design and development.As discussed in Section 2, Natyashastra is a seminal and ancientIndian text that is regarded as a comprehensive practical guide fora broad range of art forms such as music, dance, theatre, sculpture,and drama. Furthermore, it is said that Natyashastra laid down the essentials of performing arts as a representation of the ways of the world, the nature and attitudes of the people, their ways of behav-ior and manners of speech, providing necessary moral guidelines for actors in rendering flawless performances. It is said that the Natyashastra shows how the audience can feel for a moment the transcedental experience which can form the basis of all human as-piration [17]. For these reasons, we primarily consider Natyashastraas for our analysis. Table 1 summarizes the findings from the analysis by providing a mapping of the Natyshastra principle (leftmost column) to the broad ethical AI design idea (center column) and potential pathways in which the idea can be explored/developed(rightmost column). Indian art and philosophy offers different interpretations of intel-ligence and ethics, which have over the last few decades gained acceptance in modern psychology [53]. In the Indian view, intelligence refers to ‘waking up, noticing, recognizing, understanding,comprehending, and caring. Buddhi or intellect includes such things as determination, mental effort, feelings, and opinions in addition to intellectual processes such as knowledge, discrimination, and decision making [53]. As noted by one of our interview participants, Indian dance and music not only demonstrates the kind of intelli-gence seen in computational systems— such as higher calculativeability (in Indian rhythm), superlative memory (evidence includes learning of thousands of songs through oral transmission), decisionmaking capacity (while innovating on the spot), high speeds of ac-tion (in responding to co-artists), using the prosodic structure well—but it also demonstrates other capabilities often ignored by compu-tational systems. These forms of intelligence have been described as prathibha (keen intellect), prajna (transcendental wisdom), Vak(speech), and rasas (emotions).Emotions or the rasas (discussed in Section 2) form a primary premise of Indian dance system [17]. One participant who is adancer mentioned that there is an established methodology to un-derstand, codify, and express emotions in the Indian dance forms through a five-tier structure of emotions which includes ‘Vibhava’or the determinant, ‘Anubhava’ or the consequent, ‘Sthayi Bhava’or the dominant emotion, ‘Vyabhichari Bhava’ or the transient emo-tions, and ‘Sattvika Bhava’ or natural bodily responses to emotion.Thus, rasas offer a framework to understand causes and determi-nants of events as well as help in analyzing their transitions and effects. Furthermore, Natyashastra also describes that supporting causes (of usually the hero or the heroine or such objects) are of two types ‘vishaylamban’ (person or object of the rise of an emotion or the person or object for whom the emotion is awakened) and‘ashramban’ (person in whom the emotion is awakened). This kind of fine-grained analysis is beneficial for the design of ethical AI systems in that they can help in analyzing the benefit of the system for various stakeholders–what purpose it is serving, for whom, for what, etc. Rasas also facilitate communication between the actorsand the audience, serving as a pathway to help both the actors and the audience empathize with each other’s opinions. Natyashastra prescribes rasas as the essential guidelines that actors should dili-gently follow in order to creditably acquit themselves in their roles[17]. We posit that infusion of rasas or more broadly empathy in AI systems will allow perspective taking, feeling, action, meaning,understanding, imagination, socialization, and care-taking. These aspects in turn will result in AI systems that are aligned with human values, thereby facilitating the creation of trust-worthy systems. One possible way in which empathy can be infused towards enhancing ethical values in AI systems is by means of intervention aided reinforcement learning. By this we mean human-guided in-terventions in a reinforcement learning framework to optimize for aspects of empathy such as care, understanding, social welfare, and feelings. Research in robotics can provide useful cues in this regard[68]. Causal reinforcement learning frameworks could also be lever-aged to learn when to intervene [72]. Alternatively, the problem could be formulated as a restless multi-armed bandit problem such as in [2], where each stakeholder in the AI pipeline is assumed to transition from one cognitive state to another depending on the intervention, and the goal is to find the transition probabilities optimizing for empathy (which is captured in the cognitive states). Natya is seen as a comprehensive art, fusing several disciplines including music, literature, sculpture, painting, even architecture, and chikitsa shastra (i.e. study of health). Beyond rasas or emotions,Natyashastra prescribes a variety of multimodal cues for expres-sion. These include ‘vacika abhinaya’ (i.e. linguisitc expression to express tone, diction, and pitch of a particular character), ‘angicaabhinaya’ (i.e. bodily gestures), ‘aharya abhinaya’ (i.e. costumes),‘sattvika abhinaya (i.e. voluntary gestures expressed by presence of tears, horripilation, etc. to express deepest emotions). It is also characterized by different modes of production such as those based on dominance of spoken words, dominance of elevated and heroic feelings, and dominance of violent and conflictual actions. Fur-ther, there are also different kinds of musical instruments used on the dance stage and songs are included at different junctures of the performance to convey different meanings (e.g., songs sungas interventions, as entertainment, and to sooth emotions of theaudience). We posit that in order to develop ethical AI systems, a similar multimodal approach is necessary. This not only entails providing multimodal explanations underlying an AI decision and training systems through demonstrations, but also leveraging multimodal data sources (text, image, video, audio) encompassing diverse ethi-cal perspectives in defining, designing, and developing ethical AIsystems. Existing works only address parts of the proposed strategy such as through multimodal explanations [40, 61], exploration of fairness related issues in multimodal settings [7, 69], inference of norms from stories [15], or by using principles of imitation learning towards value alignment [59] ; these works neither leverage multimodal data sources nor incorporate diverse ethical perspectives in their design. For example, there is little to no work that investigates the potential of audio signals in the context of AI ethics. As can be understood by the analysis of Natyashastra [17], mu-sic and speech have the potential to characterize cause and effect,channelize events, and transform the minds of the audience. Indeed, studies in psychology have emphasized the role of sound in problems related to causal attributions [16]. These aspects are very pertinent in questions related to AI accountability. Thus, it becomes necessary to go beyond the current emphasis on a selected subset of data modalities in defining ethical notions (such as fairness based on statistical parity or equalized odds using categorical data) and leverage diverse data modalities such as audio and images as well in such characterizations whenever possible. More broadly, we believe that leveraging multimodal data during all stages of the AI pipeline—from problem formulation and data curation to algorithm design and evaluation–can be beneficial in capturing and reflecting diverse ethical values, facilitating a holistic world view.",7-8,AI systems,

Beyond rasas or emotions,Natyashastra prescribes a variety of multimodal cues for expres-sion. These include ‘vacika abhinaya’ (i.e. linguisitc expression to express tone, diction, and pitch of a particular character), ‘angicaabhinaya’ (i.e. bodily gestures), ‘aharya abhinaya’ (i.e. costumes),‘sattvika abhinaya (i.e. voluntary gestures expressed by presence of tears, horripilation, etc. to express deepest emotions). It is also characterized by different modes of production such as those based on dominance of spoken words, dominance of elevated and heroic feelings, and dominance of violent and conflictual actions. Fur-ther, there are also different kinds of musical instruments used on the dance stage and songs are included at different junctures of the performance to convey different meanings (e.g., songs sungas interventions, as entertainment, and to sooth emotions of theaudience). We posit that in order to develop ethical AI systems, a similar multimodal approach is necessary. This not only entails providing multimodal explanations underlying an AI decision and training systems through demonstrations, but also leveraging multimodal data sources (text, image, video, audio) encompassing diverse ethi-cal perspectives in defining, designing, and developing ethical AIsystems. Existing works only address parts of the proposed strategy such as through multimodal explanations [40, 61], exploration of fairness related issues in multimodal settings [7, 69], inference of norms from stories [15], or by using principles of imitation learning towards value alignment [59] ; these works neither leverage multimodal data sources nor incorporate diverse ethical perspectives in their design. For example, there is little to no work that investigates the potential of audio signals in the context of AI ethics. As can be understood by the analysis of Natyashastra [17], mu-sic and speech have the potential to characterize cause and effect,channelize events, and transform the minds of the audience. Indeed, studies in psychology have emphasized the role of sound in problems related to causal attributions [16]. These aspects are very pertinent in questions related to AI accountability. Thus, it becomes necessary to go beyond the current emphasis on a selected subset of data modalities in defining ethical notions (such as fairness based on statistical parity or equalized odds using categorical data) and leverage diverse data modalities such as audio and images as well in such characterizations whenever possible. More broadly, we believe that leveraging multimodal data during all stages of the AI pipeline—from problem formulation and data curation to algorithm design and evaluation–can be beneficial in capturing and reflecting diverse ethical values, facilitating a holistic world view.",7-8,intervention aided reinforcement learning,
14,RestlessBandit,Artifact,"In this section, we will mostly consider Natyashastra as a running illustration to put forth the unique aspects that the Indian arts canconvey in the context of ethical AI system design and development.As discussed in Section 2, Natyashastra is a seminal and ancientIndian text that is regarded as a comprehensive practical guide fora broad range of art forms such as music, dance, theatre, sculpture,and drama. Furthermore, it is said that Natyashastra laid down the essentials of performing arts as a representation of the ways of the world, the nature and attitudes of the people, their ways of behav-ior and manners of speech, providing necessary moral guidelines for actors in rendering flawless performances. It is said that the Natyashastra shows how the audience can feel for a moment the transcedental experience which can form the basis of all human as-piration [17]. For these reasons, we primarily consider Natyashastraas for our analysis. Table 1 summarizes the findings from the analysis by providing a mapping of the Natyshastra principle (leftmost column) to the broad ethical AI design idea (center column) and potential pathways in which the idea can be explored/developed(rightmost column). Indian art and philosophy offers different interpretations of intel-ligence and ethics, which have over the last few decades gained acceptance in modern psychology [53]. In the Indian view, intelligence refers to ‘waking up, noticing, recognizing, understanding,comprehending, and caring. Buddhi or intellect includes such things as determination, mental effort, feelings, and opinions in addition to intellectual processes such as knowledge, discrimination, and decision making [53]. As noted by one of our interview participants, Indian dance and music not only demonstrates the kind of intelli-gence seen in computational systems— such as higher calculativeability (in Indian rhythm), superlative memory (evidence includes learning of thousands of songs through oral transmission), decisionmaking capacity (while innovating on the spot), high speeds of ac-tion (in responding to co-artists), using the prosodic structure well—but it also demonstrates other capabilities often ignored by compu-tational systems. These forms of intelligence have been described as prathibha (keen intellect), prajna (transcendental wisdom), Vak(speech), and rasas (emotions).Emotions or the rasas (discussed in Section 2) form a primary premise of Indian dance system [17]. One participant who is adancer mentioned that there is an established methodology to un-derstand, codify, and express emotions in the Indian dance forms through a five-tier structure of emotions which includes ‘Vibhava’or the determinant, ‘Anubhava’ or the consequent, ‘Sthayi Bhava’or the dominant emotion, ‘Vyabhichari Bhava’ or the transient emo-tions, and ‘Sattvika Bhava’ or natural bodily responses to emotion.Thus, rasas offer a framework to understand causes and determi-nants of events as well as help in analyzing their transitions and effects. Furthermore, Natyashastra also describes that supporting causes (of usually the hero or the heroine or such objects) are of two types ‘vishaylamban’ (person or object of the rise of an emotion or the person or object for whom the emotion is awakened) and‘ashramban’ (person in whom the emotion is awakened). This kind of fine-grained analysis is beneficial for the design of ethical AI systems in that they can help in analyzing the benefit of the system for various stakeholders–what purpose it is serving, for whom, for what, etc. Rasas also facilitate communication between the actorsand the audience, serving as a pathway to help both the actors and the audience empathize with each other’s opinions. Natyashastra prescribes rasas as the essential guidelines that actors should dili-gently follow in order to creditably acquit themselves in their roles[17]. We posit that infusion of rasas or more broadly empathy in AI systems will allow perspective taking, feeling, action, meaning,understanding, imagination, socialization, and care-taking. These aspects in turn will result in AI systems that are aligned with human values, thereby facilitating the creation of trust-worthy systems. One possible way in which empathy can be infused towards enhancing ethical values in AI systems is by means of intervention aided reinforcement learning. By this we mean human-guided in-terventions in a reinforcement learning framework to optimize for aspects of empathy such as care, understanding, social welfare, and feelings. Research in robotics can provide useful cues in this regard[68]. Causal reinforcement learning frameworks could also be lever-aged to learn when to intervene [72].

These forms of intelligence have been described as prathibha (keen intellect), prajna (transcendental wisdom), Vak(speech), and rasas (emotions).Emotions or the rasas (discussed in Section 2) form a primary premise of Indian dance system [17]. One participant who is adancer mentioned that there is an established methodology to un-derstand, codify, and express emotions in the Indian dance forms through a five-tier structure of emotions which includes ‘Vibhava’or the determinant, ‘Anubhava’ or the consequent, ‘Sthayi Bhava’or the dominant emotion, ‘Vyabhichari Bhava’ or the transient emo-tions, and ‘Sattvika Bhava’ or natural bodily responses to emotion.Thus, rasas offer a framework to understand causes and determi-nants of events as well as help in analyzing their transitions and effects. Furthermore, Natyashastra also describes that supporting causes (of usually the hero or the heroine or such objects) are of two types ‘vishaylamban’ (person or object of the rise of an emotion or the person or object for whom the emotion is awakened) and‘ashramban’ (person in whom the emotion is awakened). This kind of fine-grained analysis is beneficial for the design of ethical AI systems in that they can help in analyzing the benefit of the system for various stakeholders–what purpose it is serving, for whom, for what, etc. Rasas also facilitate communication between the actorsand the audience, serving as a pathway to help both the actors and the audience empathize with each other’s opinions. Natyashastra prescribes rasas as the essential guidelines that actors should dili-gently follow in order to creditably acquit themselves in their roles[17]. We posit that infusion of rasas or more broadly empathy in AI systems will allow perspective taking, feeling, action, meaning,understanding, imagination, socialization, and care-taking. These aspects in turn will result in AI systems that are aligned with human values, thereby facilitating the creation of trust-worthy systems. One possible way in which empathy can be infused towards enhancing ethical values in AI systems is by means of intervention aided reinforcement learning. By this we mean human-guided in-terventions in a reinforcement learning framework to optimize for aspects of empathy such as care, understanding, social welfare, and feelings. Research in robotics can provide useful cues in this regard[68]. Causal reinforcement learning frameworks could also be lever-aged to learn when to intervene [72]. Alternatively, the problem could be formulated as a restless multi-armed bandit problem such as in [2], where each stakeholder in the AI pipeline is assumed to transition from one cognitive state to another depending on the intervention, and the goal is to find the transition probabilities optimizing for empathy (which is captured in the cognitive states). Natya is seen as a comprehensive art, fusing several disciplines including music, literature, sculpture, painting, even architecture, and chikitsa shastra (i.e. study of health). Beyond rasas or emotions,Natyashastra prescribes a variety of multimodal cues for expres-sion. These include ‘vacika abhinaya’ (i.e. linguisitc expression to express tone, diction, and pitch of a particular character), ‘angicaabhinaya’ (i.e. bodily gestures), ‘aharya abhinaya’ (i.e. costumes),‘sattvika abhinaya (i.e. voluntary gestures expressed by presence of tears, horripilation, etc. to express deepest emotions). It is also characterized by different modes of production such as those based on dominance of spoken words, dominance of elevated and heroic feelings, and dominance of violent and conflictual actions. Fur-ther, there are also different kinds of musical instruments used on the dance stage and songs are included at different junctures of the performance to convey different meanings (e.g., songs sungas interventions, as entertainment, and to sooth emotions of theaudience). We posit that in order to develop ethical AI systems, a similar multimodal approach is necessary. This not only entails providing multimodal explanations underlying an AI decision and training systems through demonstrations, but also leveraging multimodal data sources (text, image, video, audio) encompassing diverse ethi-cal perspectives in defining, designing, and developing ethical AIsystems. Existing works only address parts of the proposed strategy such as through multimodal explanations [40, 61], exploration of fairness related issues in multimodal settings [7, 69], inference of norms from stories [15], or by using principles of imitation learning towards value alignment [59] ; these works neither leverage multimodal data sources nor incorporate diverse ethical perspectives in their design. For example, there is little to no work that investigates the potential of audio signals in the context of AI ethics. As can be understood by the analysis of Natyashastra [17], mu-sic and speech have the potential to characterize cause and effect,channelize events, and transform the minds of the audience. Indeed, studies in psychology have emphasized the role of sound in problems related to causal attributions [16]. These aspects are very pertinent in questions related to AI accountability. Thus, it becomes necessary to go beyond the current emphasis on a selected subset of data modalities in defining ethical notions (such as fairness based on statistical parity or equalized odds using categorical data) and leverage diverse data modalities such as audio and images as well in such characterizations whenever possible. More broadly, we believe that leveraging multimodal data during all stages of the AI pipeline—from problem formulation and data curation to algorithm design and evaluation–can be beneficial in capturing and reflecting diverse ethical values, facilitating a holistic world view.",7-8,empathy can be infused towards enhancing ethical values in AI systems is by means of intervention aided reinforcement learning.
