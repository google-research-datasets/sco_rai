9,KnowledgeProduction,Artifact,"By August 2022, the RITPI project had concluded its fourth and final pilot of the participatory workshop and began a long-term, volun-tary collaboration with 11 of its participants to interpret and present findings from the initiative to broader research and policy audi-ences. However, as interested individuals/workstreams/divisionswithin our large technology company started learning about the initiative and inviting us to speak on it, we noticed their requests to share results were nearly always directed at us, rather than thiscollective. These invitations assumed that we could speak about,and on behalf of, the participants, as well as share quotes and find-ings from the project. Reflecting on these invitations, the second author writes in her field notes that“...the request [to share my interpretations of the find-ings] would be antithetical to the entire project thus far. It would totally recreate the researcher/participant separation and power dynamic we’ve been pushing against.” (Second Author, memo) Our explanation that this value did not belong to us, and that there were therefore things we could not disclose without participants or their consent, was often met with confusion. Although we were able to decline some of the requests to share results, these interactions served as reminders of the deeply entrenched notions of labor and value production that extend far beyond personal interactions with participants but are structural conditions of knowledge production.The first and third author would later go on to discuss the trouble with premature presentation in terms of the risk of enabling the cor-porate capture of participant-generated value. Within the broader“ethical tech” community, technology firms demonstrate enthusi-astic participation in initiatives like RTPI primarily in service of certifying their commitments all while foreclosing the possibility of more pointed critique [70]. As long as radical participatory results are attributed to researchers and their institutions, rather than large scale or extra-institutional community collaborators, their critical-ity can be easily neutralized by logics of technological solutionism, expert lenses, and personal professionalization [6].Yet, by our training, we often unwittingly alienate participantsfrom the articulation of research findings and their value. Status Quo approaches to publishing research, exhibiting the results, defin-ing contributions, determining the validity of the research agenda,proving the rigor of the methods, owning outcomes, and so forth, all imply the exclusion of the participants from ‘economies of credit’[51]. We therefore typically encounter participants only in the distilled products of their labor, such as within quotes or generic descriptions of demographic data or sample size. As the RITE project continues to work with participants to intentionally articulate and center what value means to each of them (i.e., what they hope or aim to get from our collaboration), we are doing so with a sensitivity to this political and economic context of research ownership.",1032,knowledge production,

However, as interested individuals/workstreams/divisionswithin our large technology company started learning about the initiative and inviting us to speak on it, we noticed their requests to share results were nearly always directed at us, rather than thiscollective. These invitations assumed that we could speak about,and on behalf of, the participants, as well as share quotes and find-ings from the project. Reflecting on these invitations, the second author writes in her field notes that“...the request [to share my interpretations of the find-ings] would be antithetical to the entire project thus far. It would totally recreate the researcher/participant separation and power dynamic we’ve been pushing against.” (Second Author, memo) Our explanation that this value did not belong to us, and that there were therefore things we could not disclose without participants or their consent, was often met with confusion.
