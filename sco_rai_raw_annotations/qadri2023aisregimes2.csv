9,SouthAsianParticpants,Agent,"We recruited a purposive sample [82] of participants with cultural knowledge of any one of the three nation-states in the form of lived experience, professional affiliation, and/or academic study about Pakistan, India, or Bangladesh. Purposive sampling was used to ensure diversity across the source of cultural knowledge and nation-state. We asked prospective participants to self-identify with one of the nation-states and describe their experience with the selected nation-state; we did not exclude participants based on citizenship or current residency. This allowed us to capture prospective participants with deep cultural knowledge in the South Asian diaspora who are living outside their home countries. Other inclusion criteria required participants have English-language proficiency and beat least 18 years old. We recruited through targeted emails to (1) academic listservs fo-cused on South Asian Studies programs in North America, Europe,and Asia registered with the Association for Asian Studies, as well as computing research listservs to recruit potential participants with diverse domain expertise directly relevant to our research aims; (2) cultural institutions in Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh;and (3) through the research team’s professional networks in SouthAsia. We received 219 responses. We excluded those who had only visited a country for tourism, currently work for a major technology firm, and “spam” replies with misidentified provinces or languages. We invited 52 eligible participants and; 36 people ultimately partic-ipated (Pakistan (n = 15); India (n = 13); Bangladesh (n = 8). While we did not systematically recruit for international cultural knowl-edge (e.g., linguistic and regional diversity), our sample covered ten linguistic groups and fourteen sub-national regional groups within South Asia. We had participant diversity across occupational expertise, including 17 academic researchers, 9 “cultural workers”employed in cultural industries, such as museum curation and the arts, and 10 participants with lived experience of the cultural con-texts we were studying, but not necessarily professional experience in cultural industries. All participants received a localized equivalent of $300 USD in thanks for their participation. We crafted a study design that facilitates collective engagement and conversation: focus groups. For studying culture, focus groups offer an effective means of accessing culturally-specific knowl-edge [31, 91] and can “facilitate culturally sensitive research” [54,p. 777], as the setting helps foster cohesiveness among partici-pants [67], where interactions among participants generate im-portant information [115] on cultural representation and cultural harms [81]. We also created opportunities for anonymous feedback through digital whiteboards.Each participant attended two 90-minute focus groups composed of between 7 and 9 participants from the same country to facilitate rapport [65] and allow participants to focus on the histories and cultures most relevant to them. The first focus group was structured around discussion questions and interactive activities to understand how participants defined “good” and “bad” cultural representations they had encountered in different media and how participants might assess “good” and “bad” representations in AI-generated imagery. To orient participants around the capabilities of T2I models weshared sample generated images of Western and South Asian cul-tural subject matter. The cross-cultural images served as a point of comparison in participant reflections. Following the first focus group, participants completed a survey submitting full-sentence text prompts and suggesting up to five examples of cultural events,landmarks, art styles and/or artists, historic events, figures, and characters they felt would enable the assessment of T2I models. During the second focus group, participants reviewed generated images from 4-5 prompts, seeing four images per prompt. Whilethis number of images is not sufficient to draw inferences about statistical distributions in T2I model outputs, the smaller sample enabled participants to conduct deeper reflections on generated images in alignment with study goals. During these reflections, we requested participants specifically identify what they thought generated images “got right” and what models did “poorly.” Following individual reflection, we facilitated discussion on the possibilities and risks of T2I models. We deliberately kept discussion questions open–ended to give participants agency to focus on what they found most important. Between the first and second focus group, the research team syn-thesized participant’s prompt suggestions, tested various prompts,and generated images using four state-of-the-art T2I models [88, 92,97, 122]. We constructed prompts based on participant suggestions with the aim of increasing quality and coverage of cultural references in the study. As the study’s focus is on cultural limitations, we utilized prompts that minimized the likelihood of non-cultural failures to ensure we made best use of participant’s time and exper-tise. For example, a general model failure for the prompt, “A day in Lahore,” might result in images of daylight, rather than the city;however, rewording the prompt as “People spending their day inLahore” led to images reflecting the model’s learned associations with daily life in Lahore.The final corpus included 120 prompts. We randomly assigned each prompt to two of four state-of-the-art T2I models for image generation. We then selected the first two images from each mode. All focus groups were video-recorded, transcribed, and thematically analyzed [21, 23]. We also compiled the video conference chat and participants’ written feedback into the data corpus. All four authors participated in data analysis, which involved iterative and collabo-rative development and discussion of codes and themes, drawing upon the reflective thematic analysis approach described in [21, 23]. After reviewing and developing initial codes for all the focus group data, the research team shared, arbitrated, and iterated on codes,developing preliminary themes during a series of data sessions [22],aligning on themes that cut across the focus groups while attend-ing to poignant differences between the cultural centers of focus. Interpreting raw data with relevant cultural scholarship textured participant contributions [113] with broader scale explanations and implications of cultural phenomena that participants could only briefly reference at the focus groups given time constraints. We introduce participant quotes with alphanumeric identifiers, providing their country to better contextualize participant comments. Somequotes were provided anonymously during interactive exercises,and they will only have the identifier ""A"" after the country-group. While our work offers important insights on cultural failure modes of T2I models, our methodology has limitations. A purposive sampling strategy and focus on three nation-states within a diverse region does not necessarily lead to insights that generalize across South Asia, especially as we did not systematically recruit for par-ticipant diversity, such as caste, ethno-linguistic identity, and class. Having English language proficiency as inclusion criteria, and par-ticipant and researcher academic affiliations also suggest partici-pants may largely reflect upper-class and urban-dwelling subsets of South Asia. Finally, for time and safety reasons, we did not generate images with participants in real-time; and thus, researchers remained arbiters of shown images. In this way, we characterize this study as community-centered rather than participatory. Our process of prompt synthesis and image generation did not sys-tematically disentangle the effects of different words or phrases on generated images, limiting our ability to draw inferences regarding why certain representations were emerging. We leave this important research direction to future work. [...] We outline three model failures foregrounded by South Asian participants and how they characterized these failures as reinscribing dominant regimes of representation [48]; in this case,the hegemonic ways of seeing, knowing and representing SouthAsia they experience. Broadly, participants were interested in both the accuracy of cultural subject matter recognition and nuances of cultural representations in T2I generated imagery. As P35, from Pakistan, summarized “[if I put in a particular figure, historical event,or allegory], does [the model] get what I’m trying to say, first of all?Is there a kind of understanding or legibility? But then within that,what kind of visual representation do you get? Do you get a kind ofOrientalist, portraiture rendering? Do you get an image that looks closer to maybe South Asian renderings?” Drawing from this call for cultural recognition, we present three failure modes that encapsulate participant concerns about model accuracy and representations: (1) failing to recognize cultural subjects: generated imagery fails to depict a culture’s subject matter; (2)amplifying cultural defaults: culture’s subject matter in generated images defaults to particular hegemonic cultures; and (3) perpet-uating cultural tropes: generated images contain stereotypes and tropes associated with particular cultures.",508-10,"We recruited a purposive sample [82] of participants with cultural knowledge of any one of the three nation-states in the form of lived experience, professional affiliation, and/or academic study about Pakistan, India, or Bangladesh.",

We recruited through targeted emails to (1) academic listservs fo-cused on South Asian Studies programs in North America, Europe,and Asia registered with the Association for Asian Studies, as well as computing research listservs to recruit potential participants with diverse domain expertise directly relevant to our research aims; (2) cultural institutions in Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh;and (3) through the research team’s professional networks in SouthAsia. We received 219 responses. We excluded those who had only visited a country for tourism, currently work for a major technology firm, and “spam” replies with misidentified provinces or languages. We invited 52 eligible participants and; 36 people ultimately partic-ipated (Pakistan (n = 15); India (n = 13); Bangladesh (n = 8). While we did not systematically recruit for international cultural knowl-edge (e.g., linguistic and regional diversity), our sample covered ten linguistic groups and fourteen sub-national regional groups within South Asia. We had participant diversity across occupational expertise, including 17 academic researchers, 9 “cultural workers”employed in cultural industries, such as museum curation and the arts, and 10 participants with lived experience of the cultural con-texts we were studying, but not necessarily professional experience in cultural industries. All participants received a localized equivalent of $300 USD in thanks for their participation. We crafted a study design that facilitates collective engagement and conversation: focus groups. For studying culture, focus groups offer an effective means of accessing culturally-specific knowl-edge [31, 91] and can “facilitate culturally sensitive research” [54,p. 777], as the setting helps foster cohesiveness among partici-pants [67], where interactions among participants generate im-portant information [115] on cultural representation and cultural harms [81]. We also created opportunities for anonymous feedback through digital whiteboards.Each participant attended two 90-minute focus groups composed of between 7 and 9 participants from the same country to facilitate rapport [65] and allow participants to focus on the histories and cultures most relevant to them. The first focus group was structured around discussion questions and interactive activities to understand how participants defined “good” and “bad” cultural representations they had encountered in different media and how participants might assess “good” and “bad” representations in AI-generated imagery. To orient participants around the capabilities of T2I models weshared sample generated images of Western and South Asian cul-tural subject matter. The cross-cultural images served as a point of comparison in participant reflections. Following the first focus group, participants completed a survey submitting full-sentence text prompts and suggesting up to five examples of cultural events,landmarks, art styles and/or artists, historic events, figures, and characters they felt would enable the assessment of T2I models. During the second focus group, participants reviewed generated images from 4-5 prompts, seeing four images per prompt. Whilethis number of images is not sufficient to draw inferences about statistical distributions in T2I model outputs, the smaller sample enabled participants to conduct deeper reflections on generated images in alignment with study goals. During these reflections, we requested participants specifically identify what they thought generated images “got right” and what models did “poorly.” Following individual reflection, we facilitated discussion on the possibilities and risks of T2I models. We deliberately kept discussion questions open–ended to give participants agency to focus on what they found most important. Between the first and second focus group, the research team syn-thesized participant’s prompt suggestions, tested various prompts,and generated images using four state-of-the-art T2I models [88, 92,97, 122]. We constructed prompts based on participant suggestions with the aim of increasing quality and coverage of cultural references in the study. As the study’s focus is on cultural limitations, we utilized prompts that minimized the likelihood of non-cultural failures to ensure we made best use of participant’s time and exper-tise. For example, a general model failure for the prompt, “A day in Lahore,” might result in images of daylight, rather than the city;however, rewording the prompt as “People spending their day inLahore” led to images reflecting the model’s learned associations with daily life in Lahore.The final corpus included 120 prompts. We randomly assigned each prompt to two of four state-of-the-art T2I models for image generation. We then selected the first two images from each mode. All focus groups were video-recorded, transcribed, and thematically analyzed [21, 23]. We also compiled the video conference chat and participants’ written feedback into the data corpus. All four authors participated in data analysis, which involved iterative and collabo-rative development and discussion of codes and themes, drawing upon the reflective thematic analysis approach described in [21, 23]. After reviewing and developing initial codes for all the focus group data, the research team shared, arbitrated, and iterated on codes,developing preliminary themes during a series of data sessions [22],aligning on themes that cut across the focus groups while attend-ing to poignant differences between the cultural centers of focus. Interpreting raw data with relevant cultural scholarship textured participant contributions [113] with broader scale explanations and implications of cultural phenomena that participants could only briefly reference at the focus groups given time constraints. We introduce participant quotes with alphanumeric identifiers, providing their country to better contextualize participant comments. Somequotes were provided anonymously during interactive exercises,and they will only have the identifier ""A"" after the country-group. While our work offers important insights on cultural failure modes of T2I models, our methodology has limitations. A purposive sampling strategy and focus on three nation-states within a diverse region does not necessarily lead to insights that generalize across South Asia, especially as we did not systematically recruit for par-ticipant diversity, such as caste, ethno-linguistic identity, and class. Having English language proficiency as inclusion criteria, and par-ticipant and researcher academic affiliations also suggest partici-pants may largely reflect upper-class and urban-dwelling subsets of South Asia. Finally, for time and safety reasons, we did not generate images with participants in real-time; and thus, researchers remained arbiters of shown images. In this way, we characterize this study as community-centered rather than participatory. Our process of prompt synthesis and image generation did not sys-tematically disentangle the effects of different words or phrases on generated images, limiting our ability to draw inferences regarding why certain representations were emerging. We leave this important research direction to future work. [...] We outline three model failures foregrounded by South Asian participants and how they characterized these failures as reinscribing dominant regimes of representation [48]; in this case,the hegemonic ways of seeing, knowing and representing SouthAsia they experience. Broadly, participants were interested in both the accuracy of cultural subject matter recognition and nuances of cultural representations in T2I generated imagery. As P35, from Pakistan, summarized “[if I put in a particular figure, historical event,or allegory], does [the model] get what I’m trying to say, first of all?Is there a kind of understanding or legibility? But then within that,what kind of visual representation do you get? Do you get a kind ofOrientalist, portraiture rendering? Do you get an image that looks closer to maybe South Asian renderings?” Drawing from this call for cultural recognition, we present three failure modes that encapsulate participant concerns about model accuracy and representations: (1) failing to recognize cultural subjects: generated imagery fails to depict a culture’s subject matter; (2)amplifying cultural defaults: culture’s subject matter in generated images defaults to particular hegemonic cultures; and (3) perpet-uating cultural tropes: generated images contain stereotypes and tropes associated with particular cultures.",508-10,perpetuating cultural tropes : generated images contain stereotypes and tropes associated with particular cultures,

We had participant diversity across occupational expertise, including 17 academic researchers, 9 “cultural workers”employed in cultural industries, such as museum curation and the arts, and 10 participants with lived experience of the cultural con-texts we were studying, but not necessarily professional experience in cultural industries. All participants received a localized equivalent of $300 USD in thanks for their participation. We crafted a study design that facilitates collective engagement and conversation: focus groups. For studying culture, focus groups offer an effective means of accessing culturally-specific knowl-edge [31, 91] and can “facilitate culturally sensitive research” [54,p. 777], as the setting helps foster cohesiveness among partici-pants [67], where interactions among participants generate im-portant information [115] on cultural representation and cultural harms [81]. We also created opportunities for anonymous feedback through digital whiteboards.Each participant attended two 90-minute focus groups composed of between 7 and 9 participants from the same country to facilitate rapport [65] and allow participants to focus on the histories and cultures most relevant to them. The first focus group was structured around discussion questions and interactive activities to understand how participants defined “good” and “bad” cultural representations they had encountered in different media and how participants might assess “good” and “bad” representations in AI-generated imagery. To orient participants around the capabilities of T2I models weshared sample generated images of Western and South Asian cul-tural subject matter. The cross-cultural images served as a point of comparison in participant reflections. Following the first focus group, participants completed a survey submitting full-sentence text prompts and suggesting up to five examples of cultural events,landmarks, art styles and/or artists, historic events, figures, and characters they felt would enable the assessment of T2I models. During the second focus group, participants reviewed generated images from 4-5 prompts, seeing four images per prompt. Whilethis number of images is not sufficient to draw inferences about statistical distributions in T2I model outputs, the smaller sample enabled participants to conduct deeper reflections on generated images in alignment with study goals. During these reflections, we requested participants specifically identify what they thought generated images “got right” and what models did “poorly.” Following individual reflection, we facilitated discussion on the possibilities and risks of T2I models. We deliberately kept discussion questions open–ended to give participants agency to focus on what they found most important. Between the first and second focus group, the research team syn-thesized participant’s prompt suggestions, tested various prompts,and generated images using four state-of-the-art T2I models [88, 92,97, 122]. We constructed prompts based on participant suggestions with the aim of increasing quality and coverage of cultural references in the study. As the study’s focus is on cultural limitations, we utilized prompts that minimized the likelihood of non-cultural failures to ensure we made best use of participant’s time and exper-tise. For example, a general model failure for the prompt, “A day in Lahore,” might result in images of daylight, rather than the city;however, rewording the prompt as “People spending their day inLahore” led to images reflecting the model’s learned associations with daily life in Lahore.The final corpus included 120 prompts. We randomly assigned each prompt to two of four state-of-the-art T2I models for image generation. We then selected the first two images from each mode. All focus groups were video-recorded, transcribed, and thematically analyzed [21, 23]. We also compiled the video conference chat and participants’ written feedback into the data corpus. All four authors participated in data analysis, which involved iterative and collabo-rative development and discussion of codes and themes, drawing upon the reflective thematic analysis approach described in [21, 23]. After reviewing and developing initial codes for all the focus group data, the research team shared, arbitrated, and iterated on codes,developing preliminary themes during a series of data sessions [22],aligning on themes that cut across the focus groups while attend-ing to poignant differences between the cultural centers of focus. Interpreting raw data with relevant cultural scholarship textured participant contributions [113] with broader scale explanations and implications of cultural phenomena that participants could only briefly reference at the focus groups given time constraints. We introduce participant quotes with alphanumeric identifiers, providing their country to better contextualize participant comments. Somequotes were provided anonymously during interactive exercises,and they will only have the identifier ""A"" after the country-group. While our work offers important insights on cultural failure modes of T2I models, our methodology has limitations. A purposive sampling strategy and focus on three nation-states within a diverse region does not necessarily lead to insights that generalize across South Asia, especially as we did not systematically recruit for par-ticipant diversity, such as caste, ethno-linguistic identity, and class. Having English language proficiency as inclusion criteria, and par-ticipant and researcher academic affiliations also suggest partici-pants may largely reflect upper-class and urban-dwelling subsets of South Asia. Finally, for time and safety reasons, we did not generate images with participants in real-time; and thus, researchers remained arbiters of shown images. In this way, we characterize this study as community-centered rather than participatory. Our process of prompt synthesis and image generation did not sys-tematically disentangle the effects of different words or phrases on generated images, limiting our ability to draw inferences regarding why certain representations were emerging. We leave this important research direction to future work. [...] We outline three model failures foregrounded by South Asian participants and how they characterized these failures as reinscribing dominant regimes of representation [48]; in this case,the hegemonic ways of seeing, knowing and representing SouthAsia they experience. Broadly, participants were interested in both the accuracy of cultural subject matter recognition and nuances of cultural representations in T2I generated imagery. As P35, from Pakistan, summarized “[if I put in a particular figure, historical event,or allegory], does [the model] get what I’m trying to say, first of all?Is there a kind of understanding or legibility? But then within that,what kind of visual representation do you get? Do you get a kind ofOrientalist, portraiture rendering? Do you get an image that looks closer to maybe South Asian renderings?” Drawing from this call for cultural recognition, we present three failure modes that encapsulate participant concerns about model accuracy and representations: (1) failing to recognize cultural subjects: generated imagery fails to depict a culture’s subject matter; (2)amplifying cultural defaults: culture’s subject matter in generated images defaults to particular hegemonic cultures; and (3) perpet-uating cultural tropes: generated images contain stereotypes and tropes associated with particular cultures.",508-10,"Participants reviewed generated images from 4-5 prompts, seeing four images per prompt.

To orient participants around the capabilities of T2I models weshared sample generated images of Western and South Asian cul-tural subject matter. The cross-cultural images served as a point of comparison in participant reflections. Following the first focus group, participants completed a survey submitting full-sentence text prompts and suggesting up to five examples of cultural events,landmarks, art styles and/or artists, historic events, figures, and characters they felt would enable the assessment of T2I models. During the second focus group, participants reviewed generated images from 4-5 prompts, seeing four images per prompt. Whilethis number of images is not sufficient to draw inferences about statistical distributions in T2I model outputs, the smaller sample enabled participants to conduct deeper reflections on generated images in alignment with study goals. During these reflections, we requested participants specifically identify what they thought generated images “got right” and what models did “poorly.” Following individual reflection, we facilitated discussion on the possibilities and risks of T2I models. We deliberately kept discussion questions open–ended to give participants agency to focus on what they found most important. Between the first and second focus group, the research team syn-thesized participant’s prompt suggestions, tested various prompts,and generated images using four state-of-the-art T2I models [88, 92,97, 122]. We constructed prompts based on participant suggestions with the aim of increasing quality and coverage of cultural references in the study. As the study’s focus is on cultural limitations, we utilized prompts that minimized the likelihood of non-cultural failures to ensure we made best use of participant’s time and exper-tise. For example, a general model failure for the prompt, “A day in Lahore,” might result in images of daylight, rather than the city;however, rewording the prompt as “People spending their day inLahore” led to images reflecting the model’s learned associations with daily life in Lahore.The final corpus included 120 prompts. We randomly assigned each prompt to two of four state-of-the-art T2I models for image generation. We then selected the first two images from each mode. All focus groups were video-recorded, transcribed, and thematically analyzed [21, 23]. We also compiled the video conference chat and participants’ written feedback into the data corpus. All four authors participated in data analysis, which involved iterative and collabo-rative development and discussion of codes and themes, drawing upon the reflective thematic analysis approach described in [21, 23]. After reviewing and developing initial codes for all the focus group data, the research team shared, arbitrated, and iterated on codes,developing preliminary themes during a series of data sessions [22],aligning on themes that cut across the focus groups while attend-ing to poignant differences between the cultural centers of focus. Interpreting raw data with relevant cultural scholarship textured participant contributions [113] with broader scale explanations and implications of cultural phenomena that participants could only briefly reference at the focus groups given time constraints. We introduce participant quotes with alphanumeric identifiers, providing their country to better contextualize participant comments. Somequotes were provided anonymously during interactive exercises,and they will only have the identifier ""A"" after the country-group. While our work offers important insights on cultural failure modes of T2I models, our methodology has limitations. A purposive sampling strategy and focus on three nation-states within a diverse region does not necessarily lead to insights that generalize across South Asia, especially as we did not systematically recruit for par-ticipant diversity, such as caste, ethno-linguistic identity, and class. Having English language proficiency as inclusion criteria, and par-ticipant and researcher academic affiliations also suggest partici-pants may largely reflect upper-class and urban-dwelling subsets of South Asia. Finally, for time and safety reasons, we did not generate images with participants in real-time; and thus, researchers remained arbiters of shown images. In this way, we characterize this study as community-centered rather than participatory. Our process of prompt synthesis and image generation did not sys-tematically disentangle the effects of different words or phrases on generated images, limiting our ability to draw inferences regarding why certain representations were emerging. We leave this important research direction to future work. [...] We outline three model failures foregrounded by South Asian participants and how they characterized these failures as reinscribing dominant regimes of representation [48]; in this case,the hegemonic ways of seeing, knowing and representing SouthAsia they experience. Broadly, participants were interested in both the accuracy of cultural subject matter recognition and nuances of cultural representations in T2I generated imagery. As P35, from Pakistan, summarized “[if I put in a particular figure, historical event,or allegory], does [the model] get what I’m trying to say, first of all?Is there a kind of understanding or legibility? But then within that,what kind of visual representation do you get? Do you get a kind ofOrientalist, portraiture rendering? Do you get an image that looks closer to maybe South Asian renderings?” Drawing from this call for cultural recognition, we present three failure modes that encapsulate participant concerns about model accuracy and representations: (1) failing to recognize cultural subjects: generated imagery fails to depict a culture’s subject matter; (2)amplifying cultural defaults: culture’s subject matter in generated images defaults to particular hegemonic cultures; and (3) perpet-uating cultural tropes: generated images contain stereotypes and tropes associated with particular cultures.",508-10,"Drawing from this call for cultural recognition, we present three failure modes that encapsulate participant concerns about model accuracy and representations: [...] (3) perpetuating cultural tropes : generated images contain stereotypes and tropes associated with particular cultures"
