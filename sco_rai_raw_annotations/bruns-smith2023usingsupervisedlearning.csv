9,AssumptionOfHomogeniety,Perceived_Problem,"Household responses to income shocks are important drivers of financial fragility, the evolution of wealth inequality, and the effec-tiveness of fiscal and monetary policy. Traditional approaches to measuring the size and persistence of income shocks are based on restrictive econometric models that impose strong homogeneity across households and over time. In this paper, we propose a more flexible, machine learning framework for estimating income shocks that allows for variation across all observable features and time horizons. First, we propose non-parametric estimands for shocks and shock persistence. We then show how to estimate these quantities by using off-the-shelf supervised learning tools to approximate the conditional expectation of future income given present informa-tion. We solve this income prediction problem in a large Icelandic Administrative dataset, and then use the estimated shocks to document several features of labor income risk in Iceland that are not captured by standard economic income models. [...] We use income measurements from Icelandic income tax data, made available to us through collaboration with Statistics Iceland. In ourIcelandic tax data, the period 𝑡 is measured in years, and for every individual in every year from 1981-2018 we observe (log) labor income 𝑦𝑡 and a collection of other demographic and financial variables. We transform all income observations to 2018 US dollars,adjusting for Icelandic CPI [33] and the exchange rate between the dollar and the Icelandic Króna [51]. While we observe nearly the entire population of Iceland during this timeframe, we restrict our sample to reflect in-employment labor income risk. This involves three sample selection steps: (1) we only include individual-year ob-servations with labor income strictly greater than zero; (2) we only include those individual-year observations for which we observe non-zero income for at least six consecutive periods before and at least twelve consecutive periods after; and (3) we only include observations for individuals aged thirty and older (to avoid income changes due to switching in and out of higher education). Thisleaves 508,235 individual-year observations across 62,387 individuals.Note that the choice to study in-employment labor risk and unemployment risk separately is common [10, 22, 48, 62]. Our Choice to focus on in-employment risk is mostly for purposes of presentation and for comparison with [10]. Unemployment risk is also of central interest, and re-estimating income shocks with unemployment will be the object of future work. Furthermore, the particular choice of zero for the minimum threshold might include individuals who are unemployed for part of the year; for discussion on alternative choices of the minimum threshold see Nakajima andSmirnyagin [48]. Likewise, the choice to study labor income as opposed to total income after taxes and transfers has consequences for the interpretation of our estimand. In general, these choices for sample selection and the definition of income do not change the non-parametric estimands outlined in Section 3 but are enormously important for substantive economic analysis of the results.For covariates 𝑥𝑡 , we include age, education, gender, total assets(net of debt), and housing wealth.2 Education is binned into five cat-egories: incomplete compulsory education, compulsory education only, upper secondary only, undergraduate only, and beyond undergraduate. With no essential loss of generality, instead of fitting a separate model for each 𝑡, we will fit a single predictor, but addi-tionally condition on calendar year. Thus our complete feature set includes dummies for calender year 𝑡, current income and covariates(𝑦𝑡 , 𝑥𝑡 ), and six lags of income and covariates, {(𝑦𝑡 −ℓ , 𝑥𝑡 −ℓ )}6ℓ=1.Note that this is only an approximation of the information set I𝑡 ,which should include as many lags as are available. However, wecan justify this theoretically with relatively mild assumptions on the mixing of the stochastic process for income. In practice, we also found that including more lags does not improve mean-squared error in cross-validation. As we would like to use highly-flexible regularized function classes for prediction, we leverage both sample-splitting and cross-validation to prevent overfitting. Note that while each training sample corre-sponds to an individual-year observation, the observations within an individual trajectory are highly-correlated. Therefore, we per-form all sample-splitting and cross-validation at the individual level.First, we randomly divide the full population of individuals into two halves. Within each half, we train models predicting 𝑦𝑡 +ℎ forℎ = {1, ..., 12}, using the feature set described above. Prior to train-ing, all features were shifted and scaled to have mean zero and standard deviation one. We considered a variety of regularized linear models, random forests, and gradient-boosted tree regres-sors, over a range of hyperparameter values as described in theAppendix. We chose the best performing model using 5-fold cross-validation. Gradient-boosted trees consistently performed the best in cross-validation across all horizons.The output of this process is our best approximation of the conditional expectations E[𝑦𝑡 +ℎ |I𝑡 ] for all ℎ from each of the two halves. We then compute the estimated income shocks Δ𝑡 and persistence profiles 𝜙𝑡ℎ by applying the models trained in one half to the individual-year observations in the opposite half. This way,the income shock for each observation is estimated using a model that was never previously trained using that observation.Remark: We claim that this process gives the best approxima-tion of the conditional expectation in the population. This doesn't mean that our trained models are the best predictors of fu-ture income on never-before-seen observations from a different population. Applying the predictors outside our dataset could face significant distribution shift, perhaps most notably the massive im-pact of COVID-19 in 2020 and onward. Instead, we rely on the fact that we randomly split individuals into two halves from a known population. This means the strong uniform convergence guarantees that come from the i.i.d. assumption in supervised learning apply exactly. As a result, however, any insights about income risk from our procedure are only guaranteed to describe the population ofIceland during the timeframe of our sample — extrapolating outside this population would require additional statistical assumptions.[...] With our approximations of the conditional expectations E[𝑦𝑡 +ℎ |I𝑡 ]in hand for all ℎ and 𝑡, we can estimate the shocks Δ𝑡 B 𝑦𝑡 −E[𝑦𝑡 |I𝑡 −1] and their persistence 𝜙𝑡,ℎ B E[𝑦𝑡 +ℎ |I𝑡 ]−E[𝑦𝑡 +ℎ−1 |I𝑡 −1]for every individual in every year of our sample. This produces a concrete artifact as output: income shock estimates attached to ev-ery observation that can be used in downstream economic research tasks. In this section, we use the shock data to provide an initial characterization of labor income risk in Iceland.The distribution of total shocks Δ𝑡 , is exactly equal to the distri-bution of prediction errors, but now we analyze them substantively instead of as a diagnostic tool for model fitting. From the bottom diagram in Figure 5, we can see that low-income households face much wider distribution of shocks. The 10-30% quantile shocks and the 70-90% quantile shocks are all at least twice as large for individuals at the bottom of the income distribution compared to the middle and top. This is a substantial deviation from the classical autoregressive model discussed in Section 3.2 that predicts an equal amount of income risk across the income distribution. Furthermore,notice that if we had used linear regression for prediction, then from the upper diagram in Figure 5 we would have incorrectly concluded that low income individuals face much larger positive shocks than negative shocks. Using our methodology, we can also assess how these shocks persist over time. Figure 6 plots the persistent shocks 𝜙𝑡,ℎ as a function of the total income shock Δ𝑡 . The upper diagram shows the results for ℎ = 1, and the lower for ℎ = 10. We begin by summarizing some observations for the ℎ = 1 case. First, notice the asymmetry between positive and negative income shocks, a result that mirrors recent findings of asymmetry in consumption responses [15]. For Positive total income shocks, there is a clear and roughly linear relationship between the total shock size and the persistence one period ahead. A substantial and fairly consistent proportion of total income shocks are persistent. Negative income shocks, on the other hand, are typically less persistent on average and the heterogeneity in persistence for negative shocks (e.g. as represented by 90-10 interquartile range) also appears to be much larger. Thatis, the degree of persistence of negative income shocks varies more— especially for the lowest income individuals. Furthermore, as the total income shock becomes more negative, the relationship between the shock size and persistence appears less linear.The degree of persistence drops off rapidly at longer horizons.The lower diagram of Figure 6 plots the deciles for ℎ = 10 case; they-axis now corresponds to the change in expected income 10 years into the future upon receiving the shock, 𝜙𝑡,10 = E[𝑦𝑡 +10 |𝐼𝑡 ] −E[𝑦𝑡 +10−1 |𝐼𝑡 −1]. Notice that the relationship between the total shock size and persistence 10 years into the future is much flatter, although still noticeably asymmetric. These results contrast sharply with the AR(1) income process specification from Section 3.2, in which permanent income is per-fectly persistent and so we should not see any drop over time. The Classical model also does not predict a gap in persistence between positive and negative income shocks, nor does it predict any het-erogeneity in the degree of persistence across the distribution of shocks. Each of these features of our shock series is a substantively interesting fact about labor income risk in Iceland that cannot be explained by income processes predominantly adopted in macroe-conomic structural models.","1474, 1751, 1753-4",impose strong homogeneity across households and over time,

This doesn't mean that our trained models are the best predictors of fu-ture income on never-before-seen observations from a different population. Applying the predictors outside our dataset could face significant distribution shift, perhaps most notably the massive im-pact of COVID-19 in 2020 and onward. Instead, we rely on the fact that we randomly split individuals into two halves from a known population. This means the strong uniform convergence guarantees that come from the i.i.d. assumption in supervised learning apply exactly. As a result, however, any insights about income risk from our procedure are only guaranteed to describe the population ofIceland during the timeframe of our sample — extrapolating outside this population would require additional statistical assumptions.[...] With our approximations of the conditional expectations E[𝑦𝑡 +ℎ |I𝑡 ]in hand for all ℎ and 𝑡, we can estimate the shocks Δ𝑡 B 𝑦𝑡 −E[𝑦𝑡 |I𝑡 −1] and their persistence 𝜙𝑡,ℎ B E[𝑦𝑡 +ℎ |I𝑡 ]−E[𝑦𝑡 +ℎ−1 |I𝑡 −1]for every individual in every year of our sample. This produces a concrete artifact as output: income shock estimates attached to ev-ery observation that can be used in downstream economic research tasks. In this section, we use the shock data to provide an initial characterization of labor income risk in Iceland.The distribution of total shocks Δ𝑡 , is exactly equal to the distri-bution of prediction errors, but now we analyze them substantively instead of as a diagnostic tool for model fitting. From the bottom diagram in Figure 5, we can see that low-income households face much wider distribution of shocks. The 10-30% quantile shocks and the 70-90% quantile shocks are all at least twice as large for individuals at the bottom of the income distribution compared to the middle and top. This is a substantial deviation from the classical autoregressive model discussed in Section 3.2 that predicts an equal amount of income risk across the income distribution. Furthermore,notice that if we had used linear regression for prediction, then from the upper diagram in Figure 5 we would have incorrectly concluded that low income individuals face much larger positive shocks than negative shocks. Using our methodology, we can also assess how these shocks persist over time. Figure 6 plots the persistent shocks 𝜙𝑡,ℎ as a function of the total income shock Δ𝑡 . The upper diagram shows the results for ℎ = 1, and the lower for ℎ = 10. We begin by summarizing some observations for the ℎ = 1 case. First, notice the asymmetry between positive and negative income shocks, a result that mirrors recent findings of asymmetry in consumption responses [15]. For Positive total income shocks, there is a clear and roughly linear relationship between the total shock size and the persistence one period ahead. A substantial and fairly consistent proportion of total income shocks are persistent. Negative income shocks, on the other hand, are typically less persistent on average and the heterogeneity in persistence for negative shocks (e.g. as represented by 90-10 interquartile range) also appears to be much larger. Thatis, the degree of persistence of negative income shocks varies more— especially for the lowest income individuals. Furthermore, as the total income shock becomes more negative, the relationship between the shock size and persistence appears less linear.The degree of persistence drops off rapidly at longer horizons.The lower diagram of Figure 6 plots the deciles for ℎ = 10 case; they-axis now corresponds to the change in expected income 10 years into the future upon receiving the shock, 𝜙𝑡,10 = E[𝑦𝑡 +10 |𝐼𝑡 ] −E[𝑦𝑡 +10−1 |𝐼𝑡 −1]. Notice that the relationship between the total shock size and persistence 10 years into the future is much flatter, although still noticeably asymmetric. These results contrast sharply with the AR(1) income process specification from Section 3.2, in which permanent income is per-fectly persistent and so we should not see any drop over time. The Classical model also does not predict a gap in persistence between positive and negative income shocks, nor does it predict any het-erogeneity in the degree of persistence across the distribution of shocks. Each of these features of our shock series is a substantively interesting fact about labor income risk in Iceland that cannot be explained by income processes predominantly adopted in macroe-conomic structural models.","1474, 1751, 1753-4","a more flexible, machine learning framework for estimating income shocks that allows for variation across all observable features and time horizons",
13,TraditionalApproaches,Agent,"Household responses to income shocks are important drivers of financial fragility, the evolution of wealth inequality, and the effec-tiveness of fiscal and monetary policy. Traditional approaches to measuring the size and persistence of income shocks are based on restrictive econometric models that impose strong homogeneity across households and over time. In this paper, we propose a more flexible, machine learning framework for estimating income shocks that allows for variation across all observable features and time horizons. First, we propose non-parametric estimands for shocks and shock persistence. We then show how to estimate these quantities by using off-the-shelf supervised learning tools to approximate the conditional expectation of future income given present informa-tion. We solve this income prediction problem in a large Icelandic Administrative dataset, and then use the estimated shocks to document several features of labor income risk in Iceland that are not captured by standard economic income models. [...] We use income measurements from Icelandic income tax data, made available to us through collaboration with Statistics Iceland. In ourIcelandic tax data, the period 𝑡 is measured in years, and for every individual in every year from 1981-2018 we observe (log) labor income 𝑦𝑡 and a collection of other demographic and financial variables. We transform all income observations to 2018 US dollars,adjusting for Icelandic CPI [33] and the exchange rate between the dollar and the Icelandic Króna [51]. While we observe nearly the entire population of Iceland during this timeframe, we restrict our sample to reflect in-employment labor income risk. This involves three sample selection steps: (1) we only include individual-year ob-servations with labor income strictly greater than zero; (2) we only include those individual-year observations for which we observe non-zero income for at least six consecutive periods before and at least twelve consecutive periods after; and (3) we only include observations for individuals aged thirty and older (to avoid income changes due to switching in and out of higher education). Thisleaves 508,235 individual-year observations across 62,387 individuals.Note that the choice to study in-employment labor risk and unemployment risk separately is common [10, 22, 48, 62]. Our Choice to focus on in-employment risk is mostly for purposes of presentation and for comparison with [10]. Unemployment risk is also of central interest, and re-estimating income shocks with unemployment will be the object of future work. Furthermore, the particular choice of zero for the minimum threshold might include individuals who are unemployed for part of the year; for discussion on alternative choices of the minimum threshold see Nakajima andSmirnyagin [48]. Likewise, the choice to study labor income as opposed to total income after taxes and transfers has consequences for the interpretation of our estimand. In general, these choices for sample selection and the definition of income do not change the non-parametric estimands outlined in Section 3 but are enormously important for substantive economic analysis of the results.For covariates 𝑥𝑡 , we include age, education, gender, total assets(net of debt), and housing wealth.2 Education is binned into five cat-egories: incomplete compulsory education, compulsory education only, upper secondary only, undergraduate only, and beyond undergraduate. With no essential loss of generality, instead of fitting a separate model for each 𝑡, we will fit a single predictor, but addi-tionally condition on calendar year. Thus our complete feature set includes dummies for calender year 𝑡, current income and covariates(𝑦𝑡 , 𝑥𝑡 ), and six lags of income and covariates, {(𝑦𝑡 −ℓ , 𝑥𝑡 −ℓ )}6ℓ=1.Note that this is only an approximation of the information set I𝑡 ,which should include as many lags as are available. However, wecan justify this theoretically with relatively mild assumptions on the mixing of the stochastic process for income. In practice, we also found that including more lags does not improve mean-squared error in cross-validation. As we would like to use highly-flexible regularized function classes for prediction, we leverage both sample-splitting and cross-validation to prevent overfitting. Note that while each training sample corre-sponds to an individual-year observation, the observations within an individual trajectory are highly-correlated. Therefore, we per-form all sample-splitting and cross-validation at the individual level.First, we randomly divide the full population of individuals into two halves. Within each half, we train models predicting 𝑦𝑡 +ℎ forℎ = {1, ..., 12}, using the feature set described above. Prior to train-ing, all features were shifted and scaled to have mean zero and standard deviation one. We considered a variety of regularized linear models, random forests, and gradient-boosted tree regres-sors, over a range of hyperparameter values as described in theAppendix. We chose the best performing model using 5-fold cross-validation. Gradient-boosted trees consistently performed the best in cross-validation across all horizons.The output of this process is our best approximation of the conditional expectations E[𝑦𝑡 +ℎ |I𝑡 ] for all ℎ from each of the two halves. We then compute the estimated income shocks Δ𝑡 and persistence profiles 𝜙𝑡ℎ by applying the models trained in one half to the individual-year observations in the opposite half.

[...] We use income measurements from Icelandic income tax data, made available to us through collaboration with Statistics Iceland. In ourIcelandic tax data, the period 𝑡 is measured in years, and for every individual in every year from 1981-2018 we observe (log) labor income 𝑦𝑡 and a collection of other demographic and financial variables. We transform all income observations to 2018 US dollars,adjusting for Icelandic CPI [33] and the exchange rate between the dollar and the Icelandic Króna [51]. While we observe nearly the entire population of Iceland during this timeframe, we restrict our sample to reflect in-employment labor income risk. This involves three sample selection steps: (1) we only include individual-year ob-servations with labor income strictly greater than zero; (2) we only include those individual-year observations for which we observe non-zero income for at least six consecutive periods before and at least twelve consecutive periods after; and (3) we only include observations for individuals aged thirty and older (to avoid income changes due to switching in and out of higher education). Thisleaves 508,235 individual-year observations across 62,387 individuals.Note that the choice to study in-employment labor risk and unemployment risk separately is common [10, 22, 48, 62]. Our Choice to focus on in-employment risk is mostly for purposes of presentation and for comparison with [10]. Unemployment risk is also of central interest, and re-estimating income shocks with unemployment will be the object of future work. Furthermore, the particular choice of zero for the minimum threshold might include individuals who are unemployed for part of the year; for discussion on alternative choices of the minimum threshold see Nakajima andSmirnyagin [48]. Likewise, the choice to study labor income as opposed to total income after taxes and transfers has consequences for the interpretation of our estimand. In general, these choices for sample selection and the definition of income do not change the non-parametric estimands outlined in Section 3 but are enormously important for substantive economic analysis of the results.For covariates 𝑥𝑡 , we include age, education, gender, total assets(net of debt), and housing wealth.2 Education is binned into five cat-egories: incomplete compulsory education, compulsory education only, upper secondary only, undergraduate only, and beyond undergraduate. With no essential loss of generality, instead of fitting a separate model for each 𝑡, we will fit a single predictor, but addi-tionally condition on calendar year. Thus our complete feature set includes dummies for calender year 𝑡, current income and covariates(𝑦𝑡 , 𝑥𝑡 ), and six lags of income and covariates, {(𝑦𝑡 −ℓ , 𝑥𝑡 −ℓ )}6ℓ=1.Note that this is only an approximation of the information set I𝑡 ,which should include as many lags as are available. However, wecan justify this theoretically with relatively mild assumptions on the mixing of the stochastic process for income. In practice, we also found that including more lags does not improve mean-squared error in cross-validation. As we would like to use highly-flexible regularized function classes for prediction, we leverage both sample-splitting and cross-validation to prevent overfitting. Note that while each training sample corre-sponds to an individual-year observation, the observations within an individual trajectory are highly-correlated. Therefore, we per-form all sample-splitting and cross-validation at the individual level.First, we randomly divide the full population of individuals into two halves. Within each half, we train models predicting 𝑦𝑡 +ℎ forℎ = {1, ..., 12}, using the feature set described above. Prior to train-ing, all features were shifted and scaled to have mean zero and standard deviation one. We considered a variety of regularized linear models, random forests, and gradient-boosted tree regres-sors, over a range of hyperparameter values as described in theAppendix. We chose the best performing model using 5-fold cross-validation. Gradient-boosted trees consistently performed the best in cross-validation across all horizons.The output of this process is our best approximation of the conditional expectations E[𝑦𝑡 +ℎ |I𝑡 ] for all ℎ from each of the two halves. We then compute the estimated income shocks Δ𝑡 and persistence profiles 𝜙𝑡ℎ by applying the models trained in one half to the individual-year observations in the opposite half. This way,the income shock for each observation is estimated using a model that was never previously trained using that observation.Remark: We claim that this process gives the best approxima-tion of the conditional expectation in the population. This doesn't mean that our trained models are the best predictors of fu-ture income on never-before-seen observations from a different population. Applying the predictors outside our dataset could face significant distribution shift, perhaps most notably the massive im-pact of COVID-19 in 2020 and onward. Instead, we rely on the fact that we randomly split individuals into two halves from a known population. This means the strong uniform convergence guarantees that come from the i.i.d. assumption in supervised learning apply exactly. As a result, however, any insights about income risk from our procedure are only guaranteed to describe the population ofIceland during the timeframe of our sample — extrapolating outside this population would require additional statistical assumptions.[...] With our approximations of the conditional expectations E[𝑦𝑡 +ℎ |I𝑡 ]in hand for all ℎ and 𝑡, we can estimate the shocks Δ𝑡 B 𝑦𝑡 −E[𝑦𝑡 |I𝑡 −1] and their persistence 𝜙𝑡,ℎ B E[𝑦𝑡 +ℎ |I𝑡 ]−E[𝑦𝑡 +ℎ−1 |I𝑡 −1]for every individual in every year of our sample. This produces a concrete artifact as output: income shock estimates attached to ev-ery observation that can be used in downstream economic research tasks. In this section, we use the shock data to provide an initial characterization of labor income risk in Iceland.The distribution of total shocks Δ𝑡 , is exactly equal to the distri-bution of prediction errors, but now we analyze them substantively instead of as a diagnostic tool for model fitting. From the bottom diagram in Figure 5, we can see that low-income households face much wider distribution of shocks. The 10-30% quantile shocks and the 70-90% quantile shocks are all at least twice as large for individuals at the bottom of the income distribution compared to the middle and top. This is a substantial deviation from the classical autoregressive model discussed in Section 3.2 that predicts an equal amount of income risk across the income distribution. Furthermore,notice that if we had used linear regression for prediction, then from the upper diagram in Figure 5 we would have incorrectly concluded that low income individuals face much larger positive shocks than negative shocks. Using our methodology, we can also assess how these shocks persist over time. Figure 6 plots the persistent shocks 𝜙𝑡,ℎ as a function of the total income shock Δ𝑡 . The upper diagram shows the results for ℎ = 1, and the lower for ℎ = 10. We begin by summarizing some observations for the ℎ = 1 case. First, notice the asymmetry between positive and negative income shocks, a result that mirrors recent findings of asymmetry in consumption responses [15]. For Positive total income shocks, there is a clear and roughly linear relationship between the total shock size and the persistence one period ahead. A substantial and fairly consistent proportion of total income shocks are persistent. Negative income shocks, on the other hand, are typically less persistent on average and the heterogeneity in persistence for negative shocks (e.g. as represented by 90-10 interquartile range) also appears to be much larger. Thatis, the degree of persistence of negative income shocks varies more— especially for the lowest income individuals. Furthermore, as the total income shock becomes more negative, the relationship between the shock size and persistence appears less linear.The degree of persistence drops off rapidly at longer horizons.The lower diagram of Figure 6 plots the deciles for ℎ = 10 case; they-axis now corresponds to the change in expected income 10 years into the future upon receiving the shock, 𝜙𝑡,10 = E[𝑦𝑡 +10 |𝐼𝑡 ] −E[𝑦𝑡 +10−1 |𝐼𝑡 −1]. Notice that the relationship between the total shock size and persistence 10 years into the future is much flatter, although still noticeably asymmetric. These results contrast sharply with the AR(1) income process specification from Section 3.2, in which permanent income is per-fectly persistent and so we should not see any drop over time. The Classical model also does not predict a gap in persistence between positive and negative income shocks, nor does it predict any het-erogeneity in the degree of persistence across the distribution of shocks. Each of these features of our shock series is a substantively interesting fact about labor income risk in Iceland that cannot be explained by income processes predominantly adopted in macroe-conomic structural models.","1474, 1751, 1753-4",Traditional approaches to measuring the size and persistence of income shocks are based on restrictive econometric models that impose strong homogeneity across households and over time

In this section, we use the shock data to provide an initial characterization of labor income risk in Iceland.The distribution of total shocks Δ𝑡 , is exactly equal to the distri-bution of prediction errors, but now we analyze them substantively instead of as a diagnostic tool for model fitting. From the bottom diagram in Figure 5, we can see that low-income households face much wider distribution of shocks. The 10-30% quantile shocks and the 70-90% quantile shocks are all at least twice as large for individuals at the bottom of the income distribution compared to the middle and top. This is a substantial deviation from the classical autoregressive model discussed in Section 3.2 that predicts an equal amount of income risk across the income distribution. Furthermore,notice that if we had used linear regression for prediction, then from the upper diagram in Figure 5 we would have incorrectly concluded that low income individuals face much larger positive shocks than negative shocks. Using our methodology, we can also assess how these shocks persist over time. Figure 6 plots the persistent shocks 𝜙𝑡,ℎ as a function of the total income shock Δ𝑡 . The upper diagram shows the results for ℎ = 1, and the lower for ℎ = 10. We begin by summarizing some observations for the ℎ = 1 case. First, notice the asymmetry between positive and negative income shocks, a result that mirrors recent findings of asymmetry in consumption responses [15]. For Positive total income shocks, there is a clear and roughly linear relationship between the total shock size and the persistence one period ahead. A substantial and fairly consistent proportion of total income shocks are persistent. Negative income shocks, on the other hand, are typically less persistent on average and the heterogeneity in persistence for negative shocks (e.g. as represented by 90-10 interquartile range) also appears to be much larger. Thatis, the degree of persistence of negative income shocks varies more— especially for the lowest income individuals. Furthermore, as the total income shock becomes more negative, the relationship between the shock size and persistence appears less linear.The degree of persistence drops off rapidly at longer horizons.The lower diagram of Figure 6 plots the deciles for ℎ = 10 case; they-axis now corresponds to the change in expected income 10 years into the future upon receiving the shock, 𝜙𝑡,10 = E[𝑦𝑡 +10 |𝐼𝑡 ] −E[𝑦𝑡 +10−1 |𝐼𝑡 −1]. Notice that the relationship between the total shock size and persistence 10 years into the future is much flatter, although still noticeably asymmetric. These results contrast sharply with the AR(1) income process specification from Section 3.2, in which permanent income is per-fectly persistent and so we should not see any drop over time. The Classical model also does not predict a gap in persistence between positive and negative income shocks, nor does it predict any het-erogeneity in the degree of persistence across the distribution of shocks. Each of these features of our shock series is a substantively interesting fact about labor income risk in Iceland that cannot be explained by income processes predominantly adopted in macroe-conomic structural models.","1474, 1751, 1753-4","the relationship between the total shock size and persistence 10 years into the future is much flatter, although still noticeably asymmetric."
