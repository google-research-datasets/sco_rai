9,Classification,Agent,"Classification and identification through datafication enacts data subjects. This takes place both by extracting data from individuals and using this for creating racialised profiles, and by individualising procedures that assign a given identity to a single person, combining biometric and biographic features [86]. Methodologically, this entails, starting “with the analysis of data practices as objects of research, rather than existing entities and phenomena that are datafied” [76, p. 582]. Instead of asking how colonised subjects or migrants are datafied in the colony and at the border, itis a question of shifting attention towards how individuals have been enacted as “colonised subjects” or “migrants” through identification and classification, which rely on datafying procedures such as fingerprints [82]. Yet, this does not mean that one process follows the other - for instance that migrants are brought into being exclusively through data-driven practices. Rather, it is a matter of registering the mutual interdependence between data practices and subject-making processes, that in turn depends on the historical-political origins of categories [36, 54]. Colonised subjects and migrants are partly enacted as such due to identification through datafication, that is because they are labelled, governed and known as “colonial subjects” or “migrants”. At the same time, not everything is the result of datafication and which subjects fit in some categories (such as refugees) change over time taxonomy is adopted and tailored according to specific socio-political contexts, and as scholars have demonstrated it is used for excluding most from international protection — for instance by distinguishing between “genuine” refugees and migrants — and to multiply hierarchies of undeservingness [22]; likewise, they are re-adapted andre-crafted in response to migrants’ tactics to dodge identification or to twist to their advantage classification systems, in order to obtain for instance the right to stay, as it is the case with the category of vulnerability. However, by speaking of colonial genealogy of datafication we should be careful in not assuming a substantial continuity between the use of data in the colonies and in the present. That is, if on the one side datafication is grounded in a longstanding history, shaped by colonial knowledge, on the other it is key to attend the partially different functions of datafication through history. Moreover, and relatedly, this paper contends that a critique of datafication should not be exclusively focused on its colonial legacies and, rather, it should encompass how datafication processes are used, as Gray aptly pointed out, for extracting value by multiplying differences [51]. For instance, today datafication at the border is grounded on the biometric theory developed in the 19th-century and reiterates racialised hierarchies of mobility. However, far from being a matter of linear continuity, datafication processes are used to enforce migration laws and policies that target, select and contain border crossers according to criteria different from the past.
