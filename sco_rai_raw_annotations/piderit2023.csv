9,GoLab,Agent,"During the year 2021, the School of Government of the AdolfoIbáñez University, through its public innovation laboratory GobLab,together with the Transparency Council conducted an exploratory study on the existence and use of automated decision systems in the Chilean public sector. This research began with a national survey of automated or semi-automated decision systems existing in public agencies subject to the control of the Transparency Council, partnerentity of the project and guarantor of access to public information in Chile.This survey is the first step to evaluate the transparency of these systems and to develop a concrete proposal for an algorithmic transparency standard for public agencies in Chile. The second step was to evaluate a sample of systems against an algorithmic transparency framework using publicly available information. The systems registry was carried out by means of a voluntary questionnaire, sent through an official request in January 2021 ad-dressed to the 870 public agencies under the supervision of theTransparency Council. A total of 284 entities participated by sending information on their ADS.The letter attached a form to be sent to the Council or GobLabUAI within 10 working days. During the first week of March, reminder was sent in the same terms as the first request. The total deadline for receiving responses was from January 15 to March 31,2021.The information requested included the name of the system, its purpose, whether it uses personal data or not, what personal data it uses, the unit responsible within the agency and links to publicly available information on the system.A number of questions were received requesting clarification regarding the scope of the systems to be reported. The queries include topics such as:• Whether online planning systems, such as SAP or ERP,should be considered.• If open data repositories, or observatories with aggregate statistics are included.• If online payment automation systems are included (fines,permits, fees, etc.), among others.• If only artificial intelligence systems and not other types of systems should be reported on.• If workflow systems are included in the classification.• If systems that only perform validations, for example check-ing data in a database, are considered an ADS.• Whether only systems that process personal data should bereported.To help respond to those queries, researchers created a set of frequently asked questions and answers, which would be used for the clarification process explained above. All negative responses were checked with a standardized webreview. Using the google.cl search engine and defined keywords,we reviewed five pages of results and after that generic search,this was repeated using the parameter ""site: institutional website""in the search engine with the same keywords. For the cases in which search results indicated the public agency had an existing ADS, we prepared and sent a standard response. The communi-cation included the publicly available information found, giving the possibility to update the survey response, if pertinent. The Communication was sent by the University, only to those who had responded through email. It should be noted that none of the replies were answered.It is also relevant to point out that the public entities related to financial control, national security and intelligence, when respond-ing to the official letter, indicated that, although they relied on this type of systems for their work, these could not be individualized or disclosed even in the terms indicated in the survey. The overall results of the first part of the study are as follows: Finally, of the 285 services that validly participated in the request for information, 92 ADS were found to be operating in the Public Administration. The results of the survey showed the growing use of ADS in theChilean Public Administration. It was possible to verify a greater use than publicly known, in areas of immense relevance such as health, agriculture, education, delivery of social benefits, prisons,migration, among others. Additionally, a high number of ADS use personal data and sensitive personal data in their operation.The results also revealed a dispersion in what is understood as an automated decision system. Systems that were not ADS were identified as such and systems that were ADS were omitted from the survey. Other insights of the survey were the lack of a common language or nomenclature on the operation of ADS in the public sector, which posed a problem in explaining and clarifying the scope. of the operation of the systems. Also, there were several agencies that denied the use of these systems in their official response to the survey but when checking their response, presented obvious use of these systems. Another finding was the use of centrally managedADS that are massified at the local level, through municipalities regional departments of agencies. Finally, only a minority of agencies had publicly available information on the operation ofADS in their organization.",229-30,"the School of Government of the AdolfoIbáñez University, through its public innovation laboratory GobLab, together with the Transparency Council ",

17,AutomatedDecisionSystems,Agent,"During the year 2021, the School of Government of the AdolfoIbáñez University, through its public innovation laboratory GobLab,together with the Transparency Council conducted an exploratory study on the existence and use of automated decision systems in the Chilean public sector. This research began with a national survey of automated or semi-automated decision systems existing in public agencies subject to the control of the Transparency Council, partnerentity of the project and guarantor of access to public information in Chile.This survey is the first step to evaluate the transparency of these systems and to develop a concrete proposal for an algorithmic transparency standard for public agencies in Chile. The second step was to evaluate a sample of systems against an algorithmic transparency framework using publicly available information. The systems registry was carried out by means of a voluntary questionnaire, sent through an official request in January 2021 ad-dressed to the 870 public agencies under the supervision of theTransparency Council. A total of 284 entities participated by sending information on their ADS.The letter attached a form to be sent to the Council or GobLabUAI within 10 working days. During the first week of March, reminder was sent in the same terms as the first request. The total deadline for receiving responses was from January 15 to March 31,2021.The information requested included the name of the system, its purpose, whether it uses personal data or not, what personal data it uses, the unit responsible within the agency and links to publicly available information on the system.A number of questions were received requesting clarification regarding the scope of the systems to be reported. The queries include topics such as:• Whether online planning systems, such as SAP or ERP,should be considered.• If open data repositories, or observatories with aggregate statistics are included.• If online payment automation systems are included (fines,permits, fees, etc.), among others.• If only artificial intelligence systems and not other types of systems should be reported on.• If workflow systems are included in the classification.• If systems that only perform validations, for example check-ing data in a database, are considered an ADS.• Whether only systems that process personal data should bereported.To help respond to those queries, researchers created a set of frequently asked questions and answers, which would be used for the clarification process explained above. All negative responses were checked with a standardized webreview. Using the google.cl search engine and defined keywords,we reviewed five pages of results and after that generic search,this was repeated using the parameter ""site: institutional website""in the search engine with the same keywords. For the cases in which search results indicated the public agency had an existing ADS, we prepared and sent a standard response. The communi-cation included the publicly available information found, giving the possibility to update the survey response, if pertinent.

The Communication was sent by the University, only to those who had responded through email. It should be noted that none of the replies were answered.It is also relevant to point out that the public entities related to financial control, national security and intelligence, when respond-ing to the official letter, indicated that, although they relied on this type of systems for their work, these could not be individualized or disclosed even in the terms indicated in the survey. The overall results of the first part of the study are as follows: Finally, of the 285 services that validly participated in the request for information, 92 ADS were found to be operating in the Public Administration. The results of the survey showed the growing use of ADS in theChilean Public Administration. It was possible to verify a greater use than publicly known, in areas of immense relevance such as health, agriculture, education, delivery of social benefits, prisons,migration, among others. Additionally, a high number of ADS use personal data and sensitive personal data in their operation.The results also revealed a dispersion in what is understood as an automated decision system. Systems that were not ADS were identified as such and systems that were ADS were omitted from the survey. Other insights of the survey were the lack of a common language or nomenclature on the operation of ADS in the public sector, which posed a problem in explaining and clarifying the scope. of the operation of the systems. Also, there were several agencies that denied the use of these systems in their official response to the survey but when checking their response, presented obvious use of these systems. Another finding was the use of centrally managedADS that are massified at the local level, through municipalities regional departments of agencies. Finally, only a minority of agencies had publicly available information on the operation ofADS in their organization.",229-30,"the lack of a common language or nomenclature on the operation of ADS in the public sector,"
