9,PrivacyAct,Artifact,"The Privacy Act of 1974 places significant limitations on the collection and use of personally identifiable information by government agencies. Passed in the wake of the Watergate scandal and amid growing concerns over government abuses of power and use of technology, the Act guards against the creation of a centralized federal database [109] through the adoption of a set of principles that were later enshrined into the Fair Information Practices: data minimization, purpose limitation, no disclosure without consent,rights of access and correction, and transparency (e.g., no secret data systems) [23]. Agencies can only collect information that is“relevant and necessary to accomplish a purpose of the agency” [77,§552(a)(e)(1)], and they are prohibited from disclosing personally identifiable information “to any person, or to another agency, except pursuant to a written request by, or with the prior written consent of, the individual to whom the record pertains” [77, §552(a)(a)(4)]. The statutory exceptions to the limits on disclosure often build on three general justifications: enabling statistical research [77,§552(a)(b)(5)], benefiting an agency’s mandate (the agency has a“need to know” [77, §552(a)(b)(1)]), or “routine use” that is otherwise compatible with the purpose for which the data was collected [77,§552(a)(a)(7)]. Addressing bias is not explicitly acknowledged as valid exception and is not easily justified through these standard avenues. More recently, the Confidential Information Protection And Statistical Efficiency Act of 2002 (CIPSEA) allowed “identifiable information” to be collected by federal agencies only for statistical purposes and under a pledge of confidentiality, strengthening the statistical research exception by allowing data sharing between statistical agencies (e.g., Census, Bureau of Economic Analysis, Bu-reau of Labor Statistics). We will focus on the restrictions on data sharing in this section.The U.S. Commission on Evidence-Based Policymaking’s 2018 Survey of Federal Agencies and Offices identified the Privacy Act as a major barrier to evidence-based policymaking. Of 79 respondents across various federal agencies, 47 cited “statutes prohibiting data sharing” as a barrier to data linkage [90, p. 16]. The only reason cited more frequently, by 66 respondents, was other “regulations and poli-cies that make it difficult to link data” [90, p. 16]. Nineteen percent of respondents considered “legal limitations” to be the single most significant barrier they face in using data for evidence-building [90,p. 19]. The Privacy Act and other data protection provisions that provide additional guidance and obligations for compliance, such as the e-Government Act of 2002, place a substantial burden on data collection and sharing, and consequently, on efforts to identify and reduce bias in government programs. As maintaining public trust is essential for federal agencies to operate effectively, they take conservative approach to data sharing when the law is unclear, contradictory, or silent on its legality [90, pp. 6-8]. Unfortunately,the complexity of privacy laws and exceptions create uncertainty about the precise restrictions on any given dataset.In addition to the Privacy Act, which limits both disclosure of records without individual consent as well as record disclosures be-tween agencies without written agreements, several other statutes pose restrictions that must be reconciled to understand the legal barriers to combined datasets [90]. Agency practices can turn into“cognitive limits” [108, p. 140] functioning independently of the letter of the law [108, p. 140]. In addition, evaluating risk plays a substantial role in decisions to share data. Agencies are charged with managing risk to the organization but have been exhorted to extend their ambit to include risks to individuals as well [105, p.16].4This calculus shifts the weight against sharing data to minimize risk The IRS offers an instructive example: “[t]itles 13 [providing Census privacy and confidentiality restrictions] and 26 [the In-ternal Revenue Code] of the United States Code limit the ability of Census and IRS to share data” and “Treasury officials report that laws protecting confidentiality prohibit IRS from acquiring demographic data from Census” [58, pp. 16-17] that could be used systematically to link data and evaluate bias. While Census and Treasury do enter project-based statistical research data sharing agreements, the necessary legal reviews require significant time and resources [58, p. 17]. One strength of imputation, Treasury Favored approach, is that it does not require large-scale data sharing,and thus legal review. The limitations imposed by privacy law and practice are summarized by a respondent to the Commission on Evidence-Based Policymaking’s Survey of Federal Agencies andOffices, who says: “many agencies have restrictive requirements or restrictive interpretations of confidentiality laws and regulations that make it difficult to access valuable supplemental data.”Another respondent goes further, asserting that “the most critical barrier to data exchange is legal and disclosure limitations” [90, p.17]. Finally, as mentioned above, a legacy of the Privacy Act that continues to hamper data sharing efforts is the fear of centralized government data resources. While a decentralized approach may protect the public’s privacy by making it difficult, if not impossible,for individuals to be tracked easily across agencies, this emphasis on decentralization reduced any perceived need for interoperable data infrastructure. Thus, inconsistencies in technical infrastructure proliferate and further obstruct data sharing, which in turn depri-oritizes interoperability. The proposal for the National Secure DataService (NSDS), for example, attempts to work around the concerns of a centralized database while enabling data sharing for evidence building:“[t]he Evidence Commission rejected a large-scale data warehouse model due to its untenable privacy risks and practical limitations for implementation. Instead, the experts encouraged the establishment of a National Secure Data Service as a shared service for conducting temporary data linkages for exclusively statistical purposes” [91].

Finally, as mentioned above, a legacy of the Privacy Act that continues to hamper data sharing efforts is the fear of centralized government data resources.

Passed in the wake of the Watergate scandal and amid growing concerns over government abuses of power and use of technology, the Act guards against the creation of a centralized federal database [109] through the adoption of a set of principles that were later enshrined into the Fair Information Practices: data minimization, purpose limitation, no disclosure without consent,rights of access and correction, and transparency (e.g., no secret data systems) [23]. Agencies can only collect information that is“relevant and necessary to accomplish a purpose of the agency” [77,§552(a)(e)(1)], and they are prohibited from disclosing personally identifiable information “to any person, or to another agency, except pursuant to a written request by, or with the prior written consent of, the individual to whom the record pertains” [77, §552(a)(a)(4)]. The statutory exceptions to the limits on disclosure often build on three general justifications: enabling statistical research [77,§552(a)(b)(5)], benefiting an agency’s mandate (the agency has a“need to know” [77, §552(a)(b)(1)]), or “routine use” that is otherwise compatible with the purpose for which the data was collected [77,§552(a)(a)(7)]. Addressing bias is not explicitly acknowledged as valid exception and is not easily justified through these standard avenues. More recently, the Confidential Information Protection And Statistical Efficiency Act of 2002 (CIPSEA) allowed “identifiable information” to be collected by federal agencies only for statistical purposes and under a pledge of confidentiality, strengthening the statistical research exception by allowing data sharing between statistical agencies (e.g., Census, Bureau of Economic Analysis, Bu-reau of Labor Statistics). We will focus on the restrictions on data sharing in this section.The U.S. Commission on Evidence-Based Policymaking’s 2018 Survey of Federal Agencies and Offices identified the Privacy Act as a major barrier to evidence-based policymaking. Of 79 respondents across various federal agencies, 47 cited “statutes prohibiting data sharing” as a barrier to data linkage [90, p. 16]. The only reason cited more frequently, by 66 respondents, was other “regulations and poli-cies that make it difficult to link data” [90, p. 16]. Nineteen percent of respondents considered “legal limitations” to be the single most significant barrier they face in using data for evidence-building [90,p. 19]. The Privacy Act and other data protection provisions that provide additional guidance and obligations for compliance, such as the e-Government Act of 2002, place a substantial burden on data collection and sharing, and consequently, on efforts to identify and reduce bias in government programs. As maintaining public trust is essential for federal agencies to operate effectively, they take conservative approach to data sharing when the law is unclear, contradictory, or silent on its legality [90, pp. 6-8]. Unfortunately,the complexity of privacy laws and exceptions create uncertainty about the precise restrictions on any given dataset.In addition to the Privacy Act, which limits both disclosure of records without individual consent as well as record disclosures be-tween agencies without written agreements, several other statutes pose restrictions that must be reconciled to understand the legal barriers to combined datasets [90]. Agency practices can turn into“cognitive limits” [108, p. 140] functioning independently of the letter of the law [108, p. 140]. In addition, evaluating risk plays a substantial role in decisions to share data. Agencies are charged with managing risk to the organization but have been exhorted to extend their ambit to include risks to individuals as well [105, p.16].4This calculus shifts the weight against sharing data to minimize risk The IRS offers an instructive example: “[t]itles 13 [providing Census privacy and confidentiality restrictions] and 26 [the In-ternal Revenue Code] of the United States Code limit the ability of Census and IRS to share data” and “Treasury officials report that laws protecting confidentiality prohibit IRS from acquiring demographic data from Census” [58, pp. 16-17] that could be used systematically to link data and evaluate bias.

21,Agencies,Agent,"The Privacy Act of 1974 places significant limitations on the collection and use of personally identifiable information by government agencies. Passed in the wake of the Watergate scandal and amid growing concerns over government abuses of power and use of technology, the Act guards against the creation of a centralized federal database [109] through the adoption of a set of principles that were later enshrined into the Fair Information Practices: data minimization, purpose limitation, no disclosure without consent,rights of access and correction, and transparency (e.g., no secret data systems) [23]. Agencies can only collect information that is“relevant and necessary to accomplish a purpose of the agency” [77,§552(a)(e)(1)], and they are prohibited from disclosing personally identifiable information “to any person, or to another agency, except pursuant to a written request by, or with the prior written consent of, the individual to whom the record pertains” [77, §552(a)(a)(4)]. The statutory exceptions to the limits on disclosure often build on three general justifications: enabling statistical research [77,§552(a)(b)(5)], benefiting an agency’s mandate (the agency has a“need to know” [77, §552(a)(b)(1)]), or “routine use” that is otherwise compatible with the purpose for which the data was collected [77,§552(a)(a)(7)]. Addressing bias is not explicitly acknowledged as valid exception and is not easily justified through these standard avenues. More recently, the Confidential Information Protection And Statistical Efficiency Act of 2002 (CIPSEA) allowed “identifiable information” to be collected by federal agencies only for statistical purposes and under a pledge of confidentiality, strengthening the statistical research exception by allowing data sharing between statistical agencies (e.g., Census, Bureau of Economic Analysis, Bu-reau of Labor Statistics). We will focus on the restrictions on data sharing in this section.The U.S. Commission on Evidence-Based Policymaking’s 2018 Survey of Federal Agencies and Offices identified the Privacy Act as a major barrier to evidence-based policymaking. Of 79 respondents across various federal agencies, 47 cited “statutes prohibiting data sharing” as a barrier to data linkage [90, p. 16]. The only reason cited more frequently, by 66 respondents, was other “regulations and poli-cies that make it difficult to link data” [90, p. 16]. Nineteen percent of respondents considered “legal limitations” to be the single most significant barrier they face in using data for evidence-building [90,p. 19]. The Privacy Act and other data protection provisions that provide additional guidance and obligations for compliance, such as the e-Government Act of 2002, place a substantial burden on data collection and sharing, and consequently, on efforts to identify and reduce bias in government programs. As maintaining public trust is essential for federal agencies to operate effectively, they take conservative approach to data sharing when the law is unclear, contradictory, or silent on its legality [90, pp. 6-8]. Unfortunately,the complexity of privacy laws and exceptions create uncertainty about the precise restrictions on any given dataset.In addition to the Privacy Act, which limits both disclosure of records without individual consent as well as record disclosures be-tween agencies without written agreements, several other statutes pose restrictions that must be reconciled to understand the legal barriers to combined datasets [90]. Agency practices can turn into“cognitive limits” [108, p. 140] functioning independently of the letter of the law [108, p. 140]. In addition, evaluating risk plays a substantial role in decisions to share data. Agencies are charged with managing risk to the organization but have been exhorted to extend their ambit to include risks to individuals as well [105, p.16].4This calculus shifts the weight against sharing data to minimize risk The IRS offers an instructive example: “[t]itles 13 [providing Census privacy and confidentiality restrictions] and 26 [the In-ternal Revenue Code] of the United States Code limit the ability of Census and IRS to share data” and “Treasury officials report that laws protecting confidentiality prohibit IRS from acquiring demographic data from Census” [58, pp. 16-17] that could be used systematically to link data and evaluate bias.

One strength of imputation, Treasury Favored approach, is that it does not require large-scale data sharing,and thus legal review. The limitations imposed by privacy law and practice are summarized by a respondent to the Commission on Evidence-Based Policymaking’s Survey of Federal Agencies andOffices, who says: “many agencies have restrictive requirements or restrictive interpretations of confidentiality laws and regulations that make it difficult to access valuable supplemental data.”Another respondent goes further, asserting that “the most critical barrier to data exchange is legal and disclosure limitations” [90, p.17]. Finally, as mentioned above, a legacy of the Privacy Act that continues to hamper data sharing efforts is the fear of centralized government data resources.

Passed in the wake of the Watergate scandal and amid growing concerns over government abuses of power and use of technology, the Act guards against the creation of a centralized federal database [109] through the adoption of a set of principles that were later enshrined into the Fair Information Practices: data minimization, purpose limitation, no disclosure without consent,rights of access and correction, and transparency (e.g., no secret data systems) [23].

Finally, as mentioned above, a legacy of the Privacy Act that continues to hamper data sharing efforts is the fear of centralized government data resources. While a decentralized approach may protect the public’s privacy by making it difficult, if not impossible,for individuals to be tracked easily across agencies, this emphasis on decentralization reduced any perceived need for interoperable data infrastructure.

38,Laws,reflectsPrecept,Complexity,"The Privacy Act of 1974 places significant limitations on the collection and use of personally identifiable information by government agencies. Passed in the wake of the Watergate scandal and amid growing concerns over government abuses of power and use of technology, the Act guards against the creation of a centralized federal database [109] through the adoption of a set of principles that were later enshrined into the Fair Information Practices: data minimization, purpose limitation, no disclosure without consent,rights of access and correction, and transparency (e.g., no secret data systems) [23]. Agencies can only collect information that is“relevant and necessary to accomplish a purpose of the agency” [77,§552(a)(e)(1)], and they are prohibited from disclosing personally identifiable information “to any person, or to another agency, except pursuant to a written request by, or with the prior written consent of, the individual to whom the record pertains” [77, §552(a)(a)(4)]. The statutory exceptions to the limits on disclosure often build on three general justifications: enabling statistical research [77,§552(a)(b)(5)], benefiting an agency’s mandate (the agency has a“need to know” [77, §552(a)(b)(1)]), or “routine use” that is otherwise compatible with the purpose for which the data was collected [77,§552(a)(a)(7)]. Addressing bias is not explicitly acknowledged as valid exception and is not easily justified through these standard avenues. More recently, the Confidential Information Protection And Statistical Efficiency Act of 2002 (CIPSEA) allowed “identifiable information” to be collected by federal agencies only for statistical purposes and under a pledge of confidentiality, strengthening the statistical research exception by allowing data sharing between statistical agencies (e.g., Census, Bureau of Economic Analysis, Bu-reau of Labor Statistics).
