9,Galton,Agent,"Through meticulous and manual analysis of thousands of fingerprints, Galton aimed at indexing and describing patterns on the fingerprints of subjects. Through a deep examination on thousands of fingerprints, Galton proposed to classify fingerprints taking into account symmetries, slopes, whorls and loops for the only reason of classifying human races through these symbols (see Figure 1). Following these classification guidelines, Galton transformed inked fingerprints in data and tables that categorised fingerprints through patterns and codes which could be considered a manual datafication process of fingerprint indexing. In the words of Dongus: “Galton’s system is an early form of pattern recognition” [29] and without a doubt, his work could be considered the forerunner of today’s pattern recognition in biometrics. Galton was interested in classifying human races through these patterns. In Fingerprints, he wrote a whole chapter on “Races andClasses”. He fingerprinted and manually extracted patterns of “Eng-lish, pure Welsh, Hebrew, and Negro8; also some Basques” individu-als which we had access to at the archives [40, p. 192]. There, we also observed that he collected fingerprints of other human categories such as idiots (see Figure 2).10 After printing 2,082 individuals and quantifying the number of patterns on each supposed race, Galton concluded that “there is no peculiar pattern which characterises persons of any of the above races” [40, pp. 192-193]. Influenced by Bertillon, a French police officer who developed anthropological identification methods for criminals, Galton also studied the use of fingerprints for identification and search pur-poses. Arguing that individuals in the colonies were illiterate11,deceitful12 or similar looking13, he advocated for the use of fingerprints to enhance the efficiency of identification processes in the British colonies: “beginning with the simplest requirement, of being assured that a particular person is really the man he professes to be, it has become recognised in India that the impression in ink of one or more fingers is an admirable criterion of identity, being cheap, easy and most trustworthy” [41, p. 119]. Galton also explored secondary means of anthropomorphic identification such as humanprofiles. Absorbed by the idea of datafying the human body, he proposed a formula based on anthropological measurement of the nose, lips and the curve of the chin. In Nature, Galton claimed that the use of numerical values is more appropriate than “vague adjectives” [45, p. 127] (see Figure 3). Thus, the use of this datafication mechanism, Galton argued, could enhance police investigations and criminal identifications through a numerical catalogue of criminal profiles — rather than qualitative descriptions.This archival research showcases that racialised mechanisms of datafication procedures through fingerprints began at the colony to rule the colonised. In the words of Simon A. Cole “the British contribution to the development of fingerprinting occurred not at home but abroad” [20]. Galton, the scientist that found the roots of modern statistics and was tempted to buy female slaves during his travels, strongly advocated for the use of biometrics as means of a trustworthy identification mechanism to be imposed on colonised subjects deemed to be “deceitful” and “wiliness”. This practice was then extended to other undesirable subjects at home such as prisoners. Moreover, this archive brings evidence of the connection between science, racism and the British empire through the datafi-cation of human bodies that began at the colony and was extended to the birth of eugenics. In the 19th-century, datafication of bodies and other socio-economic features were instrumentalised by sci-entists and states by imposing their despotic theories and rules to govern undesirable and marginalised subjects [50]. In Koopman’s words: “data became tethered to conceptions of discoverable factand demonstrable knowledge” [61, p. 178]. An effect that undoubtedly resonates with nowadays large-scale biometric databases for migration control in the European border regime.",844-5,Galton,

Through a deep examination on thousands of fingerprints, Galton proposed to classify fingerprints taking into account symmetries, slopes, whorls and loops for the only reason of classifying human races through these symbols (see Figure 1). Following these classification guidelines, Galton transformed inked fingerprints in data and tables that categorised fingerprints through patterns and codes which could be considered a manual datafication process of fingerprint indexing. In the words of Dongus: “Galton’s system is an early form of pattern recognition” [29] and without a doubt, his work could be considered the forerunner of today’s pattern recognition in biometrics. Galton was interested in classifying human races through these patterns. In Fingerprints, he wrote a whole chapter on “Races andClasses”. He fingerprinted and manually extracted patterns of “Eng-lish, pure Welsh, Hebrew, and Negro8; also some Basques” individu-als which we had access to at the archives [40, p. 192]. There, we also observed that he collected fingerprints of other human categories such as idiots (see Figure 2).10 After printing 2,082 individuals and quantifying the number of patterns on each supposed race, Galton concluded that “there is no peculiar pattern which characterises persons of any of the above races” [40, pp. 192-193]. Influenced by Bertillon, a French police officer who developed anthropological identification methods for criminals, Galton also studied the use of fingerprints for identification and search pur-poses. Arguing that individuals in the colonies were illiterate11,deceitful12 or similar looking13, he advocated for the use of fingerprints to enhance the efficiency of identification processes in the British colonies: “beginning with the simplest requirement, of being assured that a particular person is really the man he professes to be, it has become recognised in India that the impression in ink of one or more fingers is an admirable criterion of identity, being cheap, easy and most trustworthy” [41, p. 119]. Galton also explored secondary means of anthropomorphic identification such as humanprofiles. Absorbed by the idea of datafying the human body, he proposed a formula based on anthropological measurement of the nose, lips and the curve of the chin. In Nature, Galton claimed that the use of numerical values is more appropriate than “vague adjectives” [45, p. 127] (see Figure 3).
