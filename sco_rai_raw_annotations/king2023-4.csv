9,StateOfFederalDataInfrastructure,Artifact,"A last major barrier to disparity assessments lies in the state of federal data infrastructure. Legacy systems, limited provisions for interoperability, lack of technical expertise, and administrative burdens can make data collection and sharing costly. Many scholars document the technical limitations that obstruct data sharing and linkage; O’Hara and Medalia specifically note a lack of staff, in-teroperability requirements, and over-specificity in funding “even when sharing is advantageous”[108]. One example of a deficit in technical infrastructure damaging data collection is the USDA’s failed attempt to update demographic data collection for agricultural lending through the Market Facilitation Program. Even though a 2011 departmental regulation prohibiting employees from using visual observation to determine race and ethnicity, the USDA’s customer data management system continued to require that employees enter a value for demographic fields as late as 2019, so over two-thirds of race records for the program were still determined by employees’ assessments. After The USDA realized the flaws in their data management system, they committed to remedying them, but still noted that fully updating their data management to make race and ethnicity optional would take months [107]. The Veterans Affairs administration faces similar obstacles; despite a desire to evaluate their programs using demographic data, the VA lacks the technical, personnel, and financial resources to update their fragmented infrastructure. VA data is maintained by a range of data stewards, leading to what some University of California San Francisco researchers call a “sometimes-confusing alphabet soup of data partners” [24]. In response to a bill proposing mandatory data collection [62], the VA noted that while demographic data is already collected, funds should be directed towards “improving existing collection, storage, management and analytics efforts” [16].Rather than investing in a new form collection process, the VA's data officer calls for transforming the existing VA Profile system into a centralized data hub. The VA response to EO 13,985 recognizes that inconsistent data collection damages VA’s “ability to assess where potential disparities or barriers exist” and calls fora “Data for Equity strategy. . . that will synchronize VA’s data on health care, disability benefits, other veteran-facing services, andaddress data gaps in demographic information” [136]. Here, even with the desire to collect and use demographic data, a range of programs and data managers create a technical barrier.The Commission on Evidence-Based Policymaking’s survey of federal agency employees found that variation in agencies’ techni-cal infrastructure poses a significant challenge, noting specifically that agencies may struggle to “conduct disclosure reviews” and institute “disclosure avoidance protocols” [90, p.4]. While statistical agencies are better equipped to collect, link, and analyze data while adhering to privacy standards, they are “less likely to view the purpose for which they collect data to be as a resource for evaluating programs” due to the restrictions of laws like CIPSEA, which limit disclosure of personally identifiable information for statisti-cal agencies [90, p.4]. Beyond the well-documented technical and resource constraints on data management, bias assessment efforts can be specifically stymied by lacking technical infrastructure and expertise required to implement privacy protections.",500,"the state of federal data infrastructure.
