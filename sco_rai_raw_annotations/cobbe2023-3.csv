9,Integration,Strategy,"Some providers of AI and other cloud services commonly found in algorithmic supply chains have reached high levels of integration; both horizontally (across markets and sectors), and vertically (across production and distribution processes). This has implications for their positioning and role in algorithmic supply chains.3.3.1 Horizontal integration. Horizontally integrated companies operate across markets and sectors. The most prominent cloud providers (Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Alibaba, IBM) offer various services across many related and adjacent markets and may appear repeatedly in a supply chain. Some such services are AI-related;others are infrastructure for applications (storage, database, contentdelivery, credential management, and so on); still others are user-facing, from business and consumer web-based services (such as maps or photo backup) to software packages for customers and their users (such as Microsoft 365). This allows a single provider to re-purpose their AI and other technologies across a range of services, both infrastructural and user-facing. It is common for providers to purchase potential competitors and new market entrants, either to obtain intellectual property, to expand their services across markets,or to stifle emerging competition in existing markets. Providers can also simplify how existing customers bring AI services within their applications by providing tools to facilitate integrating them with their other services. Providers may financially incentivise customers to use several of their services instead of those of competitors.3.3.2 Vertical integration. Vertically integrated companies control multiple stages of production and distribution. Several major providers—primarily Amazon, Microsoft, and Google—own key infrastructure for producing their systems and distributing them as services across markets: data centers and servers; content delivery networks; APIs and customer-facing interfaces; and network infras-tructure. Vertical integration offers bespoke technical infrastructure specific to these providers’ needs which they can use for many ser-vices across markets to exploit economies of scale. High resolution media (requiring significant resources), for example, thus encour-ages vertical integration, as does state-of-the-art AI production(requiring more data, bigger and more complex models, intensive computer, and sophisticated training and testing processes). Ver-tically integrated providers can link deployment of systems by customers to their production processes, testing and further refining those AI technologies using customers’ input data, applications,and real-world use cases [24]. This allows providers to reduce the resources needed to improve models, while offsetting some research and development costs by bringing it into a process paid for by customers [24]. They can thus lower the net cost of developing more accurate and more generalisable systems [24].However, vertical integration has limits. AI providers might not operate in-house data cleaning and labeling processes, for instance(key parts of training, testing, and updating models). The business benefits to providers of bringing these processes ‘in house’ are potentially outweighed by the commercial advantages of extending supply chains across borders to exploit differences in laws (§4.3.2). Aspects of AI production are often instead outsourced to low-paid and insecure workers in the Global South [46, 84] (through data cleaning and labeling services offered by companies like SamaAI [95], or through Mechanical Turk [2]). Moreover, some major providers now offer access through their services to generative(foundation) models produced and controlled by others, marking a shift towards less integration in some emerging product sectors.3.3.3 Providers all the way down. Though some prominent providers are both horizontally and vertically integrated, most aren't. Instead, they tend to specialize in a few closely-related services,such as algorithmic recruitment, processing legal documents, cer-tain medical processes [64], and even ‘algorithmic governance’ and ethical AI’ (see [33]), without operating across traditional cloud service markets. These specialist providers typically ‘rent’ techno-logical infrastructure from a larger provider rather than operating their own (OpenAI, for example, exclusively uses Microsoft’s Azure Cloud services [73]). This reflects the fact that developing advanced AI technologies and operating them at scale will in many cases require technical resources beyond the means of all but the biggest providers. As a result, whether through their own AI services or through those of others who depend on their cloud infrastructure,major providers like AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud will be crucial players in future AI development and distribution.Some AI-specific providers’ services can be accessed only through a larger provider’s interface and brought by customers into applications through that specific provider’s cloud, rather than through a competitor (OpenAI’s commercial services can be ac-cessed only through Azure [73]). The larger provider’s cloud offering thus operates as a platform through which they facilitate and can gatekeep market access to the smaller provider’s service. In some cases, one cloud provider’s interface may be used to access a specialist AI provider’s model [100], where that specialist provider itself uses a different cloud provider for their supporting infrastructure for development [6]. That is to say, several large cloud providers may be involved at different stages of production and deployment of specialist AI providers’ services (and indeed,those of others).",1191,"have reached high levels of integration; both horizontally (across markets and sectors), and vertically (across production and distribution processes).",

16,FacilitationOfMarketAccess,Strategy,"Some providers of AI and other cloud services commonly found in algorithmic supply chains have reached high levels of integration; both horizontally (across markets and sectors), and vertically (across production and distribution processes). This has implications for their positioning and role in algorithmic supply chains.3.3.1 Horizontal integration. Horizontally integrated companies operate across markets and sectors. The most prominent cloud providers (Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Alibaba, IBM) offer various services across many related and adjacent markets and may appear repeatedly in a supply chain. Some such services are AI-related;others are infrastructure for applications (storage, database, contentdelivery, credential management, and so on); still others are user-facing, from business and consumer web-based services (such as maps or photo backup) to software packages for customers and their users (such as Microsoft 365). This allows a single provider to re-purpose their AI and other technologies across a range of services, both infrastructural and user-facing. It is common for providers to purchase potential competitors and new market entrants, either to obtain intellectual property, to expand their services across markets,or to stifle emerging competition in existing markets. Providers can also simplify how existing customers bring AI services within their applications by providing tools to facilitate integrating them with their other services. Providers may financially incentivise customers to use several of their services instead of those of competitors.3.3.2 Vertical integration. Vertically integrated companies control multiple stages of production and distribution. Several major providers—primarily Amazon, Microsoft, and Google—own key infrastructure for producing their systems and distributing them as services across markets: data centers and servers; content delivery networks; APIs and customer-facing interfaces; and network infras-tructure. Vertical integration offers bespoke technical infrastructure specific to these providers’ needs which they can use for many ser-vices across markets to exploit economies of scale. High resolution media (requiring significant resources), for example, thus encour-ages vertical integration, as does state-of-the-art AI production(requiring more data, bigger and more complex models, intensive computer, and sophisticated training and testing processes). Ver-tically integrated providers can link deployment of systems by customers to their production processes, testing and further refining those AI technologies using customers’ input data, applications,and real-world use cases [24]. This allows providers to reduce the resources needed to improve models, while offsetting some research and development costs by bringing it into a process paid for by customers [24]. They can thus lower the net cost of developing more accurate and more generalisable systems [24].However, vertical integration has limits. AI providers might not operate in-house data cleaning and labeling processes, for instance(key parts of training, testing, and updating models). The business benefits to providers of bringing these processes ‘in house’ are potentially outweighed by the commercial advantages of extending supply chains across borders to exploit differences in laws (§4.3.2). Aspects of AI production are often instead outsourced to low-paid and insecure workers in the Global South [46, 84] (through data cleaning and labeling services offered by companies like SamaAI [95], or through Mechanical Turk [2]). Moreover, some major providers now offer access through their services to generative(foundation) models produced and controlled by others, marking a shift towards less integration in some emerging product sectors.3.3.3 Providers all the way down. Though some prominent providers are both horizontally and vertically integrated, most aren't. Instead, they tend to specialize in a few closely-related services,such as algorithmic recruitment, processing legal documents, cer-tain medical processes [64], and even ‘algorithmic governance’ and ethical AI’ (see [33]), without operating across traditional cloud service markets. These specialist providers typically ‘rent’ techno-logical infrastructure from a larger provider rather than operating their own (OpenAI, for example, exclusively uses Microsoft’s Azure Cloud services [73]). This reflects the fact that developing advanced AI technologies and operating them at scale will in many cases require technical resources beyond the means of all but the biggest providers. As a result, whether through their own AI services or through those of others who depend on their cloud infrastructure,major providers like AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud will be crucial players in future AI development and distribution.Some AI-specific providers’ services can be accessed only through a larger provider’s interface and brought by customers into applications through that specific provider’s cloud, rather than through a competitor (OpenAI’s commercial services can be ac-cessed only through Azure [73]). The larger provider’s cloud offering thus operates as a platform through which they facilitate and can gatekeep market access to the smaller provider’s service. In some cases, one cloud provider’s interface may be used to access a specialist AI provider’s model [100], where that specialist provider itself uses a different cloud provider for their supporting infrastructure for development [6].

27,AbilityToRepurpose,constrainsAgent,Providers,"Some providers of AI and other cloud services commonly found in algorithmic supply chains have reached high levels of integration; both horizontally (across markets and sectors), and vertically (across production and distribution processes). This has implications for their positioning and role in algorithmic supply chains.3.3.1 Horizontal integration. Horizontally integrated companies operate across markets and sectors. The most prominent cloud providers (Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Alibaba, IBM) offer various services across many related and adjacent markets and may appear repeatedly in a supply chain. Some such services are AI-related;others are infrastructure for applications (storage, database, contentdelivery, credential management, and so on); still others are user-facing, from business and consumer web-based services (such as maps or photo backup) to software packages for customers and their users (such as Microsoft 365). This allows a single provider to re-purpose their AI and other technologies across a range of services, both infrastructural and user-facing. It is common for providers to purchase potential competitors and new market entrants, either to obtain intellectual property, to expand their services across markets,or to stifle emerging competition in existing markets. Providers can also simplify how existing customers bring AI services within their applications by providing tools to facilitate integrating them with their other services. Providers may financially incentivise customers to use several of their services instead of those of competitors.3.3.2 Vertical integration. Vertically integrated companies control multiple stages of production and distribution. Several major providers—primarily Amazon, Microsoft, and Google—own key infrastructure for producing their systems and distributing them as services across markets: data centers and servers; content delivery networks; APIs and customer-facing interfaces; and network infras-tructure. Vertical integration offers bespoke technical infrastructure specific to these providers’ needs which they can use for many ser-vices across markets to exploit economies of scale. High resolution media (requiring significant resources), for example, thus encour-ages vertical integration, as does state-of-the-art AI production(requiring more data, bigger and more complex models, intensive computer, and sophisticated training and testing processes). Ver-tically integrated providers can link deployment of systems by customers to their production processes, testing and further refining those AI technologies using customers’ input data, applications,and real-world use cases [24]. This allows providers to reduce the resources needed to improve models, while offsetting some research and development costs by bringing it into a process paid for by customers [24]. They can thus lower the net cost of developing more accurate and more generalisable systems [24].However, vertical integration has limits. AI providers might not operate in-house data cleaning and labeling processes, for instance(key parts of training, testing, and updating models). The business benefits to providers of bringing these processes ‘in house’ are potentially outweighed by the commercial advantages of extending supply chains across borders to exploit differences in laws (§4.3.2). Aspects of AI production are often instead outsourced to low-paid and insecure workers in the Global South [46, 84] (through data cleaning and labeling services offered by companies like SamaAI [95], or through Mechanical Turk [2]). Moreover, some major providers now offer access through their services to generative(foundation) models produced and controlled by others, marking a shift towards less integration in some emerging product sectors.3.3.3 Providers all the way down. Though some prominent providers are both horizontally and vertically integrated, most aren't. Instead, they tend to specialize in a few closely-related services,such as algorithmic recruitment, processing legal documents, cer-tain medical processes [64], and even ‘algorithmic governance’ and ethical AI’ (see [33]), without operating across traditional cloud service markets. These specialist providers typically ‘rent’ techno-logical infrastructure from a larger provider rather than operating their own (OpenAI, for example, exclusively uses Microsoft’s Azure Cloud services [73]). This reflects the fact that developing advanced AI technologies and operating them at scale will in many cases require technical resources beyond the means of all but the biggest providers. As a result, whether through their own AI services or through those of others who depend on their cloud infrastructure,major providers like AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud will be crucial players in future AI development and distribution.Some AI-specific providers’ services can be accessed only through a larger provider’s interface and brought by customers into applications through that specific provider’s cloud, rather than through a competitor (OpenAI’s commercial services can be ac-cessed only through Azure [73]).

34,FacilitationOfMarketAccess,constrainsAgent,Providers,"Some providers of AI and other cloud services commonly found in algorithmic supply chains have reached high levels of integration; both horizontally (across markets and sectors), and vertically (across production and distribution processes). This has implications for their positioning and role in algorithmic supply chains.3.3.1 Horizontal integration. Horizontally integrated companies operate across markets and sectors. The most prominent cloud providers (Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Alibaba, IBM) offer various services across many related and adjacent markets and may appear repeatedly in a supply chain. Some such services are AI-related;others are infrastructure for applications (storage, database, contentdelivery, credential management, and so on); still others are user-facing, from business and consumer web-based services (such as maps or photo backup) to software packages for customers and their users (such as Microsoft 365). This allows a single provider to re-purpose their AI and other technologies across a range of services, both infrastructural and user-facing. It is common for providers to purchase potential competitors and new market entrants, either to obtain intellectual property, to expand their services across markets,or to stifle emerging competition in existing markets. Providers can also simplify how existing customers bring AI services within their applications by providing tools to facilitate integrating them with their other services. Providers may financially incentivise customers to use several of their services instead of those of competitors.3.3.2 Vertical integration. Vertically integrated companies control multiple stages of production and distribution. Several major providers—primarily Amazon, Microsoft, and Google—own key infrastructure for producing their systems and distributing them as services across markets: data centers and servers; content delivery networks; APIs and customer-facing interfaces; and network infras-tructure. Vertical integration offers bespoke technical infrastructure specific to these providers’ needs which they can use for many ser-vices across markets to exploit economies of scale. High resolution media (requiring significant resources), for example, thus encour-ages vertical integration, as does state-of-the-art AI production(requiring more data, bigger and more complex models, intensive computer, and sophisticated training and testing processes). Ver-tically integrated providers can link deployment of systems by customers to their production processes, testing and further refining those AI technologies using customers’ input data, applications,and real-world use cases [24]. This allows providers to reduce the resources needed to improve models, while offsetting some research and development costs by bringing it into a process paid for by customers [24]. They can thus lower the net cost of developing more accurate and more generalisable systems [24].However, vertical integration has limits. AI providers might not operate in-house data cleaning and labeling processes, for instance(key parts of training, testing, and updating models). The business benefits to providers of bringing these processes ‘in house’ are potentially outweighed by the commercial advantages of extending supply chains across borders to exploit differences in laws (§4.3.2). Aspects of AI production are often instead outsourced to low-paid and insecure workers in the Global South [46, 84] (through data cleaning and labeling services offered by companies like SamaAI [95], or through Mechanical Turk [2]). Moreover, some major providers now offer access through their services to generative(foundation) models produced and controlled by others, marking a shift towards less integration in some emerging product sectors.3.3.3 Providers all the way down. Though some prominent providers are both horizontally and vertically integrated, most aren't. Instead, they tend to specialize in a few closely-related services,such as algorithmic recruitment, processing legal documents, cer-tain medical processes [64], and even ‘algorithmic governance’ and ethical AI’ (see [33]), without operating across traditional cloud service markets. These specialist providers typically ‘rent’ techno-logical infrastructure from a larger provider rather than operating their own (OpenAI, for example, exclusively uses Microsoft’s Azure Cloud services [73]). This reflects the fact that developing advanced AI technologies and operating them at scale will in many cases require technical resources beyond the means of all but the biggest providers. As a result, whether through their own AI services or through those of others who depend on their cloud infrastructure,major providers like AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud will be crucial players in future AI development and distribution.Some AI-specific providers’ services can be accessed only through a larger provider’s interface and brought by customers into applications through that specific provider’s cloud, rather than through a competitor (OpenAI’s commercial services can be ac-cessed only through Azure [73]). The larger provider’s cloud offering thus operates as a platform through which they facilitate and can gatekeep market access to the smaller provider’s service. In some cases, one cloud provider’s interface may be used to access a specialist AI provider’s model [100], where that specialist provider itself uses a different cloud provider for their supporting infrastructure for development [6]. That is to say, several large cloud providers may be involved at different stages of production and deployment of specialist AI providers’ services (and indeed,those of others).",1191,The larger provider’s cloud offering thus operates as a platform through which they facilitate and can gatekeep market access to the smaller provider’s service.
