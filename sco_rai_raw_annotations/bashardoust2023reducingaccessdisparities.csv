9,EnsureSimilarAllocation,Perceived_Problem,"In the setting of information access, natural questions of fairness arise in the problem of ensuring similar allocation among demographic groups,which are often represented as disjoint subsets of nodes. Inspired by the literature on social position initiated by Granovetter’s strength of weak ties [36] and framed in the context of online social networks by boyd, Levy, and Marwick [10], there has been a rash of recent work on computational questions around fairness in access on social networks [1, 6, 29–31, 38, 39, 45, 53, 57, 63, 69, 74]. The key underlying idea is that information access is a resource, and Fish etal. [31] argued that access based on network position is a form of privilege, which they used to define a notion of individual fairness. Much of the work on defining and applying fairness has been undertaken in the influence maximization framework. One important thrust has been improving equity among demographic groups within a network, typically defined based on protected classes (e.g., race, gender) [1, 39, 57, 63, 69]. They develop metrics and algorithms to ensure that roughly equal amounts of information reach each demographic group while optimizing influence maximization. In allcases, a single piece of information is being spread in the network.Intervention takes the form of augmenting the seed set in mostwork, though [39, 66] consider adding edges instead of seeds. Another recent work on edge augmentation to maximize the influence of a given group [6, 26], advantage is inherently defined to be access to (a small) seed set.Several other recent papers in the space consider variants of the basic access problem.",1636-7,the problem of ensuring similar allocation,
