9,LackOfGovernanceDefinition,Perceived_Problem,"Whereas the European Commission does not offer a comprehensive definition of its “European way of data governance” [23], data governance has in general been defined by scholars as the exercise of authority and control over the management of data, whilst its purpose would be to increase the value of data and minimize data-related costs and risks [1]. Von Grafenstein differentiates between three analytical layers that are equally mentioned by the legislators with each having their own challenges: (i) the regulatory layer (ii)the organizational layer (iii) the technological layer [32].Since the Juncker Commission identified the creation of a Digital Single Market as a critical policy objective in 2014, the EU has been extremely active in proposing regulation for a digital economy that ensures a high level of data protection while, at the sametime, boosting competitiveness and innovation capacities. With the recognition of data as an “essential resource for economic growth, job creation, and societal progress” [18], the interest in data governance has spiked over the last years, gathering worldwide attention of policy-makers and research communities. Whereas the regulation of data flows originated in attempts to protect the fundamental rights to privacy and data protection [62], regulatory perspectives evolved with the growing understanding of benefits that result from data-driven innovation that relies on data as a resource [59]. Since data would not have any intrinsic value but its value would rather depend on the context of use as well as the extent to which it can be reused [60] ensuring availability and access to quality data has become a key concern.Whilst the European Data Protection Framework has been con-ceived in fundamental rights terms, it has a dual purpose to also ensure the free flow of personal data [48]. EU policy of the past years therefore equally aimed at adding a fifth to the four existing freedoms of the European Single Market (free flow of goods, cap-ital, services, and labor): the free flow of data.[12, 79] However,in addition to growing concerns about the internal consistency of this patchwork of rules and regulations [13] the question comes up if the current path to data governance taken by the EU in its Data Strategy is capable of achieving its objectives. How a framework should look like that ensures both the availability of personal and nonpersonal data to a wide variety of actors as well as the protection of fundamental rights of different stakeholders is far from clear. Whilst substantial gains are expected from exploiting the non-rivalrous character of data by increasing its availability, neither companies nor individuals would necessarily want their data widely available due to potential threats to privacy, intellec-tual property rights, or trade secrets if data is disclosed [11], [12].Resolving these tensions lies at the heart of discussions on how to design a framework for the data-agile economy. It, therefore, comes as no surprise that commentators described the regulation of datamarkets as ""shaping up to be one of the major challenges of the twenty-first century"" [76].",616,"does not offer a comprehensive definition of its “European way of data governance” [23],",
