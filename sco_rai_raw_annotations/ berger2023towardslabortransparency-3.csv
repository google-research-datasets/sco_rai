9,LimitationsOfInformedConsentForm,Perceived_Problem,"Recruitment for the RITPI project’s participatory workshops were completed by July of 2022 although its protocols would be a subject of critical interrogation for months afterward. At the center of these conversations was the Informed Consent Form (ICF). When we first approached recruitment for the RITPI project, we relied on or prior experiences with practices in User Interaction and Experience (UIX), and cognitive and clinical research, where prospective research participants are typically provided an ICF at the start of the study, asked to read it, and finally prompted to provide a signature indicating presupposed agreement with the methods, signaling an assumed willingness to be exposed to various research procedures.The practice drew from a notion of informed consent that emerged in the 1950s through 1970s as a reaction to medical paternalism and the demand of patients in clinical trials to be made aware of potential risks and benefits [3]; since then, it has transformed into a requirement across multiple research disciplines, often framed as one of the ways in which participants’ autonomy is protected or upheld [52].Yet, upon examining the ICFs implicit checkbox-approach to consent, we recognized that a typical ICF failed to capture the more rigorous conditions of collaboration that the RITPI project sought to establish, and instead implied a unidirectional relationship where participants would be contracted into projects which are entirely scientist-led, designed, and managed [18]. In a debrief between the first and second authors where they considered various strategies to counteract these limitations, the first author probes: “What [is the point]? Nothing about this process feels participatory."" (First Author,debrief meeting).These frustrations originate in a disbelief over the power of the ICF to set all the terms and conditions of our work relationships with participants. The first author felt that, in this sense, the ICF acted much like a wage contract. Its procedural details functioned to recruit participants as laboring subjects, tasked to produce data and research value under interviews, design workshops, prototyping,behavioral studies, etc. Its stated benefits functioned to define the compensation of participation (or lack thereof). Through the act of consenting to these terms, participants would be simultaneously brought into the study but held at a distance—expected to engage in the work of participation without any ownership over the research process or product.Ownership was central to RITA's broader goals in its relevance to the ultimate distribution of value and gain in the research process.For instance, even if we made executive decisions to more equitably share in these gains, we realized that as long as we were in a position to prescribe the terms of this distribution in the ICF’s calculus of the costs and benefits of participation (Figure 1), the project would impose an instrumental, transactional logic onto the collaboration.What is worse, due to a general lack of transparency in both the function of the ICF and its calculus, its use in our study would have had the overall effect of appropriating the labor of participants for corporate and institutional ends.To make this calculus less opaque, the first- and second-authors deconstructed the ICF over the course of the recruitment process;this process is summarized in Figure 1. The typical ICF predefined benefits of participation’ as opportunities to upskill, network, and learn about the subject of study. However, we noticed that while these gains are stated upfront, the ICF leaves undisclosed other forms of value that are assumed to belong to researchers and their affiliated institutions. These undisclosed benefits come in the form of publications for the researcher, resources for further funding opportunities, and business insights for institutional or corporate funders, as just some examples. By dictating costs and benefits,procedures and expected time under contract, ICFs carve out a strategic ‘beginning’ and ‘end’ to participation, leaving participants estranged from any value produced outside those terms. Yet, in the context of interrogating these assumptions, the first-author frequently wondered if there really was anything ‘outside’ this collaboration:“Participation doesn’t stop once the [workshops] end.We will always be drawing on their insights and quotes and the data produced in the session. Why shouldn't they be there for that?"" (First Author, debrief meeting discussing co-authorship) As a result, we began to see the ICFs can as an agent of appropriation in larger institutional apparatuses of capture. This prompted us to reframe the ICF as a work contract and revise our RITA's consent protocol according to feminist models of consent, where consent is understood as an ongoing dialogue and is, thereby, re-versible [61]. By late June 2022, our ICF included a rigorous opt-out policy, a radical position on data use and ownership, as well as a tiered checklist of different aspects or modes of participation that remained transparent about the value and labor associated with each. Given these, our participants’ signatures represented not only understanding and agreement but also, importantly, a willingness to collaborate and labor together towards a notion of value that would be defined collectively and that would be recognizable as such. Moreover, this signature was understood to be not the moment of consent but rather a moment of consent, as participants could update choices, iterate on various terms, and make decisions about participation in the future, all of which required continuously revisiting consent throughout the research.Our embrace of feminist notions of consent welcomed the possi-bility of refusal. By framing refusal as an election into a particular mode of participation (into tiers of time commitment and types of contributions), we sought to reframe the act of changing one's mind such that it did not carry a negative valence. For instance, if a participant chose to retract their contribution and data from analysis. Lines of communication were kept open, unless otherwise indicated, to share updates and elicit feedback irrespective of selected modes of participation. These participants could still under-stand their influence on the project in terms of their impact on other collaborators as well as to the journey of the broader research initia-tive. This approach to refusal dis-identifies the value of participants labor from data, research outcomes, or design products and lower the stakes of changing, exiting or (re-)entering the collaboration by assuring participants of their status as full collaborators, rather than as research subjects.",1030-2,a typical ICF failed to capture the more rigorous conditions of collaboration,

By framing refusal as an election into a particular mode of participation (into tiers of time commitment and types of contributions), we sought to reframe the act of changing one's mind such that it did not carry a negative valence.

Lines of communication were kept open, unless otherwise indicated, to share updates and elicit feedback irrespective of selected modes of participation.

20,RevisedInformedConsentForm,influencesPrecept,FeministModelsOfConsent,"Recruitment for the RITPI project’s participatory workshops were completed by July of 2022 although its protocols would be a subject of critical interrogation for months afterward. At the center of these conversations was the Informed Consent Form (ICF). When we first approached recruitment for the RITPI project, we relied on or prior experiences with practices in User Interaction and Experience (UIX), and cognitive and clinical research, where prospective research participants are typically provided an ICF at the start of the study, asked to read it, and finally prompted to provide a signature indicating presupposed agreement with the methods, signaling an assumed willingness to be exposed to various research procedures.The practice drew from a notion of informed consent that emerged in the 1950s through 1970s as a reaction to medical paternalism and the demand of patients in clinical trials to be made aware of potential risks and benefits [3]; since then, it has transformed into a requirement across multiple research disciplines, often framed as one of the ways in which participants’ autonomy is protected or upheld [52].Yet, upon examining the ICFs implicit checkbox-approach to consent, we recognized that a typical ICF failed to capture the more rigorous conditions of collaboration that the RITPI project sought to establish, and instead implied a unidirectional relationship where participants would be contracted into projects which are entirely scientist-led, designed, and managed [18]. In a debrief between the first and second authors where they considered various strategies to counteract these limitations, the first author probes: “What [is the point]? Nothing about this process feels participatory."" (First Author,debrief meeting).These frustrations originate in a disbelief over the power of the ICF to set all the terms and conditions of our work relationships with participants. The first author felt that, in this sense, the ICF acted much like a wage contract. Its procedural details functioned to recruit participants as laboring subjects, tasked to produce data and research value under interviews, design workshops, prototyping,behavioral studies, etc. Its stated benefits functioned to define the compensation of participation (or lack thereof). Through the act of consenting to these terms, participants would be simultaneously brought into the study but held at a distance—expected to engage in the work of participation without any ownership over the research process or product.Ownership was central to RITA's broader goals in its relevance to the ultimate distribution of value and gain in the research process.For instance, even if we made executive decisions to more equitably share in these gains, we realized that as long as we were in a position to prescribe the terms of this distribution in the ICF’s calculus of the costs and benefits of participation (Figure 1), the project would impose an instrumental, transactional logic onto the collaboration.What is worse, due to a general lack of transparency in both the function of the ICF and its calculus, its use in our study would have had the overall effect of appropriating the labor of participants for corporate and institutional ends.To make this calculus less opaque, the first- and second-authors deconstructed the ICF over the course of the recruitment process;this process is summarized in Figure 1. The typical ICF predefined benefits of participation’ as opportunities to upskill, network, and learn about the subject of study. However, we noticed that while these gains are stated upfront, the ICF leaves undisclosed other forms of value that are assumed to belong to researchers and their affiliated institutions. These undisclosed benefits come in the form of publications for the researcher, resources for further funding opportunities, and business insights for institutional or corporate funders, as just some examples. By dictating costs and benefits,procedures and expected time under contract, ICFs carve out a strategic ‘beginning’ and ‘end’ to participation, leaving participants estranged from any value produced outside those terms. Yet, in the context of interrogating these assumptions, the first-author frequently wondered if there really was anything ‘outside’ this collaboration:“Participation doesn’t stop once the [workshops] end.We will always be drawing on their insights and quotes and the data produced in the session. Why shouldn't they be there for that?"" (First Author, debrief meeting discussing co-authorship) As a result, we began to see the ICFs can as an agent of appropriation in larger institutional apparatuses of capture. This prompted us to reframe the ICF as a work contract and revise our RITA's consent protocol according to feminist models of consent, where consent is understood as an ongoing dialogue and is, thereby, re-versible [61]. By late June 2022, our ICF included a rigorous opt-out policy, a radical position on data use and ownership, as well as a tiered checklist of different aspects or modes of participation that remained transparent about the value and labor associated with each. Given these, our participants’ signatures represented not only understanding and agreement but also, importantly, a willingness to collaborate and labor together towards a notion of value that would be defined collectively and that would be recognizable as such. Moreover, this signature was understood to be not the moment of consent but rather a moment of consent, as participants could update choices, iterate on various terms, and make decisions about participation in the future, all of which required continuously revisiting consent throughout the research.Our embrace of feminist notions of consent welcomed the possi-bility of refusal.
