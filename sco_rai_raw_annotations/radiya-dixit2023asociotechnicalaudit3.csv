9,OIFR,Artifact,"Our final case is the operational trial of mobile phone or operator initiated facial recognition (OIFR) conducted by South Wales Police (SWP) from December 2021 to March 2022 [90]. SWP provided more documentation about their use of OIFR in comparison with their LFR trial. However, as illustrated in Table 3, significant gaps remain with regard to ethical and legal standards. First, the watchlist included all SWP custody images with no limits on the seriousness of offense. This broad inclusion raises concerns about the legal requirement of ""necessary in a democratic society"", especially whether SWP conducted distinct necessity tests for people with minor offenses and those with serious offenses. Moreover, the watchlist included images of innocent persons who were arrested but unconvicted, despite these images being unlawful to retain [42].Second, while SWP took proactive steps to evaluate bias and discrimination, there was a lack of full transparency for these evaluations. SWP evaluated OIFR’s accuracy before its operational use and found no evidence of algorithmic bias. However, SWP did not publish the demographic distribution of the evaluation dataset, which is crucial to assess bias. Additionally, SWP provided the demographic data for the people on which OIFR was used, but the demographic data for the watchlist and those arrested are unknown. With regard to oversight, SWP engaged with the SWP Joint Independent Ethics Committee before and after the OIFR trial. However, the committee consists of police officers and is a body situated within the police, raising concerns about the independence of the oversight. Based on the most recently published meeting minutes,there were no independent experts in human rights, equality, or data protection on the committee. Moreover, SWP did not consult the public nor civil society to gather feedback for the OIFR trial.Finally, across all three case studies, there was no clear frame-work to ensure accountability for the misuse or failure of FRT [54].There was a lack of robust redress mechanisms for those harmed by FRT deployments. Additionally, police force documents were not fully accessible to people with disabilities or provided in immigrant languages. This lack of accessibility makes it difficult for certain groups to understand how FRT impacts them and to seek remedy in the case of harm.",1341-42,mobile phone or operator initiated facial recognition (OIFR),
