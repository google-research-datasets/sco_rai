9,PressureToSpeakOnBehalfOfCommunities,Perceived_Problem,"With this background and approach in mind, we present the RITPI case as an empirical illustration of the value of labor-sensitivity to make the exploitative potential of these collaborations visi-ble. In order to maintain an iterative movement between obser-vation and interpretation, our narration of the case study follows an auto-ethnographic structure. We present three ""ethnographic episodes"" [54] wherein we first report on our initial orientations to-wards the labor of participants—constructed through fieldnotes andre-readings of our initial research design—and then contrast these methodological decisions with the subsequent revisions we made after encountering tensions between our participatory principles and the labor dynamics revealed to us through our approach. To Illustrate these tensions, we draw directly from debrief memos between the authors on describing the progress of the RTPI initiative while, at the same time, situating these experiences in relation to the positionality of the researcher, e.g. disciplinary training, hierarchies of expertise, and institutional incentives.5.1 Episode 1: Production of ParticipatoryArtifactsThe primary objective of the RITPI project—i.e, to elicit and docu-ment the perspectives of participants with respect to the potential impact of emerging technologies on themselves and the communi-ties they belong to—was conceived in isolation from participants over the course of several months in early 2022, and was formulated in response to a perceived need within our larger research group to develop and deliver methods for conducting socially responsible,community-based impact research. During this time we explored several critical participatory design methods—including agonistic participatory design, participatory speculative design, and infras-tructural speculation—and synthesized them into four participatory prototyping workshops of 5-7 participants each.At the time, we envisioned that participatory prototyping would produce speculative artifacts and, through discussing their contexts of deployment, participants would be able to share their excitement on how emerging technologies might serve their communities and raise concerns about the ways in which these technologies might reproduce structures of inequality with respect to race, class, gen-der, ability, etc. We hoped these artifacts could act as a means by which participants could voice issues they may not otherwise beable to due to power dynamics [35]. However, as the project started recruiting members from BRGs in June 2022, we noticed an emerg-ing tension between business interests and those of participants. Ina debrief meeting, the second author remarked on these conflicting responsibilities:There is so much pressure to produce results in this project, particularly in the form of best practices, reproducible methods or exercises, or publications. . . and none of that pressure is coming from the participant group – it’s coming from others who have in some way,shape, or form ‘supported’ the effort. (Second author,debrief memo)This prompted us to question the extent to which the methodologi-cal decision to translate participatory principles into prototyping workshops had been influenced by research and corporate pres-sures. We realized that what conventionally counts as participatory value is circumscribed by demands to produce artifacts that can be adopted with measurable impact, which is exemplified by the assertion that “in order for participatory design to be successful, it has to result in an [. . . ] artifact that can be (and in fact is) appropri-ated in real use” [67]. This bias towards tangible, deliverable, and solution-oriented design artifacts [9] was reinforced by a business culture that defines research value by particular quality standards,corporate KPIs, and output-based reward structures [14].We also began to reflect on how participation was circumscribed by DEI marketing logics. For our project to be considered valu-able and receive sustained support, we needed to demonstrate its effectiveness in eliciting and documenting diverse community per-spectives. Because the lack of diversity in the technology industry has been identified as one of the factors that have led to some of technology’s differential social harms, the inclusion of diverse perspectives stands to benefit society; however, from the point of view of corporate interest, including diverse perspectives serves an additional purpose. Demonstrating that diverse groups have been consulted during participatory design allows corporations to validate technology as community-approved, thereby enhancing corporate reputation and profit goals.Such macro-level dynamics were further complicated by latent constructions of an a priori community. Reflecting on our project,we noticed that diversity and inclusion logics could present a con-tradictory demand for participants. While community members vol-unteer to join BRGs, these groups are organized around company-defined communities of ""diversity and inclusion"" (i.e., Black, His-panic, Native American and Indigenous, Pan-Asian, LGBTQ+, PWDA,Veteran, and Women). Rather than participating on their own terms,then, participants might feel pressure to perform “community expertise,” i.e., to speak on behalf of entire communities, irrespective of whether such interventions are representative of their own experiences. The preconception that participant identity itself holds value could foreclose avenues for participants to stand in tension and contradiction with their identities or the identities that were assumed of them, which would limit their opportunities to exer-cise suspicion or disagreement with normative understandings of belonging.Within this context, participatory prototyping practice would require participants to stand in the position of the laboring subject,a position that implied a determination on who was demanded to produce an artifact (i.e., participants) and under whose terms (i.e.,researchers)—a dynamic we realized had to be avoided as much as possible. Thus, by its first pilot session, we had revised RITA's approach to the participatory workshop to engage participants in critical unmaking [54]. Rather than enlist them in the ideation,prototyping, and testing of products, critical unmaking involved inverting roles of production such that we, as the researchers, devel-oped design artifacts in advance, only for them to be deconstructed by participants during the sessions.In an exercise we termed ‘Deconstruction,’ we encouraged par-ticipants to engage in the unmaking of the social worlds and infras-tructures that the pre-designed artifacts were narratively embedded in [69]. Contesting the imagined “lifeworlds” of these artifacts, such as their regulatory, environmental and repair conditions [69], par-ticipants were encouraged to unearth each products’ conditions of possibility—e.g., the taken-for-granted fictions presumed by their designs that would have to hold in order for the existence of the design to make sense. Through re-imagining participatory prototyp-ing in this way, we hoped to open up a broader field of contention in which participants could exercise radical skepticism and dis-agreement about these technological futures rather than produce marketable solutions to them.",1029-30,"might feel pressure to perform “community expertise,” i.e., to speak on behalf of entire communities, irrespective of whether such interventions are representative of their own experiences.

Ina debrief meeting, the second author remarked on these conflicting responsibilities:There is so much pressure to produce results in this project, particularly in the form of best practices, reproducible methods or exercises, or publications. . . and none of that pressure is coming from the participant group – it’s coming from others who have in some way,shape, or form ‘supported’ the effort. (Second author,debrief memo)This prompted us to question the extent to which the methodologi-cal decision to translate participatory principles into prototyping workshops had been influenced by research and corporate pres-sures. We realized that what conventionally counts as participatory value is circumscribed by demands to produce artifacts that can be adopted with measurable impact, which is exemplified by the assertion that “in order for participatory design to be successful, it has to result in an [. . . ] artifact that can be (and in fact is) appropri-ated in real use” [67]. This bias towards tangible, deliverable, and solution-oriented design artifacts [9] was reinforced by a business culture that defines research value by particular quality standards,corporate KPIs, and output-based reward structures [14].We also began to reflect on how participation was circumscribed by DEI marketing logics. For our project to be considered valu-able and receive sustained support, we needed to demonstrate its effectiveness in eliciting and documenting diverse community per-spectives. Because the lack of diversity in the technology industry has been identified as one of the factors that have led to some of technology’s differential social harms, the inclusion of diverse perspectives stands to benefit society; however, from the point of view of corporate interest, including diverse perspectives serves an additional purpose. Demonstrating that diverse groups have been consulted during participatory design allows corporations to validate technology as community-approved, thereby enhancing corporate reputation and profit goals.Such macro-level dynamics were further complicated by latent constructions of an a priori community. Reflecting on our project,we noticed that diversity and inclusion logics could present a con-tradictory demand for participants. While community members vol-unteer to join BRGs, these groups are organized around company-defined communities of ""diversity and inclusion"" (i.e., Black, His-panic, Native American and Indigenous, Pan-Asian, LGBTQ+, PWDA,Veteran, and Women). Rather than participating on their own terms,then, participants might feel pressure to perform “community expertise,” i.e., to speak on behalf of entire communities, irrespective of whether such interventions are representative of their own experiences. The preconception that participant identity itself holds value could foreclose avenues for participants to stand in tension and contradiction with their identities or the identities that were assumed of them, which would limit their opportunities to exer-cise suspicion or disagreement with normative understandings of belonging.Within this context, participatory prototyping practice would require participants to stand in the position of the laboring subject,a position that implied a determination on who was demanded to produce an artifact (i.e., participants) and under whose terms (i.e.,researchers)—a dynamic we realized had to be avoided as much as possible. Thus, by its first pilot session, we had revised RITA's approach to the participatory workshop to engage participants in critical unmaking [54]. Rather than enlist them in the ideation,prototyping, and testing of products, critical unmaking involved inverting roles of production such that we, as the researchers, devel-oped design artifacts in advance, only for them to be deconstructed by participants during the sessions.In an exercise we termed ‘Deconstruction,’ we encouraged par-ticipants to engage in the unmaking of the social worlds and infras-tructures that the pre-designed artifacts were narratively embedded in [69]. Contesting the imagined “lifeworlds” of these artifacts, such as their regulatory, environmental and repair conditions [69], par-ticipants were encouraged to unearth each products’ conditions of possibility—e.g., the taken-for-granted fictions presumed by their designs that would have to hold in order for the existence of the design to make sense. Through re-imagining participatory prototyp-ing in this way, we hoped to open up a broader field of contention in which participants could exercise radical skepticism and dis-agreement about these technological futures rather than produce marketable solutions to them.",1029-30,we encouraged par-ticipants to engage in the unmaking of the social worlds and infras-tructures that the pre-designed artifacts were narratively embedded in
