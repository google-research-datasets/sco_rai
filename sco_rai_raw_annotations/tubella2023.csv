9,BiasTowardSmallNumberOfCreators,Causal_Theory,"To further illustrate the use of ACROCPoLis, let us examine recent work on the search and recommendation algorithms of the video platform YouTube, and how they are analyzed in terms of fairness in the literature. YouTube’s algorithms are proprietary (closed-source and not documented in a transparent manner from a user or public perspective). This opacity has triggered studies into the features of the algorithms as well as the consequences of their operations within the platform, based on publicly accessible facts [3, 53].Two such studies are examined here: the first study focuses on examining the question of whether the YouTube recommendation algorithm favors a small subset of the video content available on the platform [35]; and the second examines whether YouTube’ssearch algorithm is biased toward video content associated with specific positions on the United States political spectrum [40].Kirdemir et al. [35] investigate the structure of recommendation networks, and probabilistic distribution of video recommendations from a given node in the network. Recommendation graphs are con-structed based on eight different real-world scenarios (seed video sources) to then apply a stochastic approach and observe PageR-ank [47, 48] distributions over such graphs. The study found that a small fraction of the nodes in the recommendation network received the large majority of connections, suggesting that YouTube’srecommendation algorithm is biased toward a small number of content items available on the platform. Lutz et al. [40] examine political bias in YouTube’s recommen-dation and search algorithms from a US-centered, binary (right-leaning vs left-leaning) perspective. Search and recommendations were studied in separate experiments. We will be concerned exclusively with the study on the search algorithm. For that experiment, the authors scraped the 200 top search results for a variety of politically-charged terms in the US public debate, using fourYouTube accounts with different viewing profiles create for the experiment. The top search results for each term and each profile were evaluated for their political leaning. The study found that left-leaning content items were significantly more likely to appear among the three top search results. Do these studies indicate unfair biases in YouTube’s search and recommendation algorithms? Let us use the ACROCPoLis frame-work to examine these cases in detail, starting from the identifica-tion of the relevant components.In Table 1, the ACROCPoLis framework is used to describe the fairness-relevant components extracted from both articles. In addition to identifying the components playing a role in each paper, let us take a closer look at the Links that are relevant for assessing the fairness of the situations examined in the studies at hand, and what they reveal about the limitations of the analyses proposed therein. In [35], the focus is on the possibility that the YouTube recommendation algorithm is biased toward certain sorts of content, thus generating a pattern in which users are ultimately pushed towards a small fraction of the content available on the platform (ContentBias). The Actors identified by the paper, i.e., content creators, con-tent consumers, and YouTube itself, are seen on the background ofYouTube’s revenue model (Context). The platform revenue’s model is largely organized around advertisement revenue, which is shared between the company and the content creators. Thereby, YouTube have an interest in maximizing the time spent by consumers on the platform, thus increasing the amount of advertisement they are exposed to; while content creators have an interest in maximizing the number of platform users that view the content items they produce, thus increasing the share of advertisement revenue they receive from the platform (Resources).Interestingly, the paper seems to place most of the Power in the hands of YouTube itself, insofar as the platform is responsi-ble for the recommendation algorithm that increases the visibility and accessibility of certain content items rather than others. TheACROCPoLis framework, however, invites an examination as well if the Power, if any, that the other Actors possess. First, content creators arguably have an important amount of Power in shaping the allocation and distribution of the relevant Resources (time spent and views by content consumers). Indeed, it is at least in part the attractiveness and interest of the content items they produce that attract consumers to YouTube to start with. Moreover, content creators may aim at creating content items that they believe will attract a larger number of users, in light of their own knowledge about societal trends and public interest in different subject matters. Finally, content creators may partially reverse-engineer some of the Criteria used by YouTube’s recommendation algorithm in order to increase the likelihood of appearing as recommended content to the population of consumers they think might be more attracted to their content items (a sort of Recommender Engine Optimiza-tion). In consequence, content creators should arguably not be seen as passive, powerless Actors in the situation under examination.While their interests partially overlap with those of the platform,they also partially differ, insofar as content creators compete among themselves for the available Resources, while YouTube is mostly interested in overall content consumption on the platform.Similarly, and perhaps more strikingly, content consumers in theplatform are treated as purely passive Actors in the paper. Indeed,the methods used in the research simulate consumers that fullyfollow the deliverances of the recommender algorithm (with some noise added), thus being largely deprived of any Power in deciding what content to consume, and for how long. This is an oversim-plification that the authors acknowledge, but it risks neglecting relevant Links that are central to the assessment of the fairness of the outputs of YouTube’s recommender algorithm. Content consumers have at least some degree of autonomy in selecting the content items to consume, and which recommendations to follow or to ignore. Importantly, they may thus influence the Criteria embodied in the recommender algorithm itself. It is indeed in the interest of YouTube to generate recommendations that mirror the type of content that consumers may want to engage with, and it is hence to be expected that the algorithm responds to the patterns of consumer preference in the platform. Moreover, the large amount of data that Alphabet, the owner of YouTube, possesses about eachuser of its services allows considerable personalization of content recommendations. However, as the authors admit, studying the influence of personalization on the recommendations produced byYouTube is very challenging. In brief, through the Power content consumers possess by means of their consumption preferences, they likely influence the Criteria (i.e., the features used by the recommendation algorithm) that lead to the observed Outcomes(i.e., recommendations that encourage consumers to view a small fraction of the content items available).The above considerations suggest that an assessment of whether or not the content bias found by the researchers is unfair or else requires a fuller picture of the Power the relevant Actors possess, and how they shape the Criteria that produce the content bias found by the study. It may well be, for example, that no unfairness is involved, say, if what the recommendation algorithm does is to successfully draw users toward content items that they are more likely to want to consume. Given the varying quality of the content items avail-able, the variety of subject matters treated in such content items,and social trends that help determine what is or is not in the ’public eye’, it is arguably expected that relatively few content items are taken to be particularly interesting by content consumers. In other words, YouTube’s recommender algorithm might be appropriately promoting content items with higher relevance, interest, and qual-ity. Importantly, we are not claiming that this is the case. Our claims merely that the paper leaves under defined several ACROPoLis components and Links that are crucial to a satisfying assessment of the fairness of the situation being examined. Analogous considerations apply to [40]. The result of the paper that concerns us here is the finding that YouTube’s search algorithm shows a bias toward placing more left-leaning content among the top three search results on the platform than would be expected inlight of the relative representation of political leanings among con-tent items. One central methodological choice in the paper is that of inferring the distribution of political leanings across the YouTubeuser base in the US from the political leanings found in the sample of content items examined in the study. Under the ACROPoLis framework, this methodological choice is far from inconsequential,since it involves a conflation between two different Actor categories that are non-overlapping and that have partially incompatible in-terests and Power, namely content creators, and content consumers.Content creators are plausibly interested in maximizing the view-ership of their content items, and content consumers are interested in consuming the content items that they find most interesting, en-tertaining, or informative. While this suggests that content creators should aim at satisfying consumer preferences, the goals of content creators can also involve other considerations, such as popularizing minority positions, spreading relatively neglected ideas and ideolo-gies, and the like. In other words, it is plausible that the political leanings expressed by content producers are not an appropriate measure of the political leanings of content consumers. As the ACROCPoLis analysis makes clear, content creators and content consumers are different Actors, who possess different kinds and degrees of Power in shaping the search ranking algorithm (Cri-teria) and thus the Outcomes. Thereby, the study results could almost be used to argue that there is an unfair bias in top 3 search results in the US under a uniform distribution understanding of fairness (i.e., equal exposure to be given to each political leaning,regardless of representativeness in the population). It is doubtful,however, that uniform distribution is the appropriate approach to fairness to be used in this case, as it would also require YouTube to give space to extreme political positions that have little representa-tion in the general population.As with [35], this study does not take into consideration the role of content consumers in shaping the search ranking algorithm that YouTube employs. As the authors admit, this is a limitation of the study, for if the political bias found is mostly due to consumer preferences, it is debatable that such a bias is unfair at all, rather than being an expression of the Power exercised by content con-sumers over the search ranking algorithm (and thus over YouTubeitself) by means of their autonomous consumption choices. Bothpapers, moreover, do not go into the role that policymakers have in shaping the Criteria, and thus the Outcomes. This neglect is ar-guably justified, insofar as, at least in solidly democratic countries,policy interventions are mostly concerned with illegal and harmful content, while free speech guarantees make it so that policymakers have little Power when it comes to influencing the Criteria andOutcomes involving legal content items.Importantly, the considerations above are not meant to diminish the value of the studies examined. They are merely intended as illustrations of how the ACROCPoLis framework can help furnish a fuller picture of what pieces of information are needed in order to provide more strongly substantiated fairness assessments of specific situations and processes. Indeed, the ACROCPoLis analyzes abovepoint out limitations in the studies examined, thus revealing further research questions that need to be explored to complement their findings.Finally, it should not have escaped the reader’s attention that glaring gap in the foregoing examination, and in the studies themselves, is the Criteria component. This is due to the fact thatYouTube’s algorithms are proprietary and closed, making it so that the Power that different Actors exercise in shaping it, as well as how the algorithms lead to the observed outcomes, is only partially inferrable by input-output testing of the platform. Moreover, it's likely that YouTube’s algorithms are constantly in flux, with fixes and tweaks introduced by the company to improve their working inlight of the platform’s interests and the regulatory requirements it is called by policymakers to respect. This makes it so that a fully adequate fairness assessment of YouTube, by the lights of ACROCPoLis,cannot currently be produced. As an aside, it is worthwhile to point out that the counterfactual scenario in which YouTube’s algorithm are made openly available, either by the company or by successful reverse-engineering, would importantly change the ACROPoLis analysis. After all, it is plausible that in such a situation more of thePower would move to the hands of content creators, hence changing the Outcomes produced (potentially in undesirable and/or unfairways).

12,ContentCreators,Agent,"To further illustrate the use of ACROCPoLis, let us examine recent work on the search and recommendation algorithms of the video platform YouTube, and how they are analyzed in terms of fairness in the literature. YouTube’s algorithms are proprietary (closed-source and not documented in a transparent manner from a user or public perspective). This opacity has triggered studies into the features of the algorithms as well as the consequences of their operations within the platform, based on publicly accessible facts [3, 53].Two such studies are examined here: the first study focuses on examining the question of whether the YouTube recommendation algorithm favors a small subset of the video content available on the platform [35]; and the second examines whether YouTube’ssearch algorithm is biased toward video content associated with specific positions on the United States political spectrum [40].Kirdemir et al. [35] investigate the structure of recommendation networks, and probabilistic distribution of video recommendations from a given node in the network. Recommendation graphs are con-structed based on eight different real-world scenarios (seed video sources) to then apply a stochastic approach and observe PageR-ank [47, 48] distributions over such graphs. The study found that a small fraction of the nodes in the recommendation network received the large majority of connections, suggesting that YouTube’srecommendation algorithm is biased toward a small number of content items available on the platform. Lutz et al. [40] examine political bias in YouTube’s recommen-dation and search algorithms from a US-centered, binary (right-leaning vs left-leaning) perspective. Search and recommendations were studied in separate experiments. We will be concerned exclusively with the study on the search algorithm. For that experiment, the authors scraped the 200 top search results for a variety of politically-charged terms in the US public debate, using fourYouTube accounts with different viewing profiles create for the experiment. The top search results for each term and each profile were evaluated for their political leaning. The study found that left-leaning content items were significantly more likely to appear among the three top search results. Do these studies indicate unfair biases in YouTube’s search and recommendation algorithms? Let us use the ACROCPoLis frame-work to examine these cases in detail, starting from the identifica-tion of the relevant components.In Table 1, the ACROCPoLis framework is used to describe the fairness-relevant components extracted from both articles. In addition to identifying the components playing a role in each paper, let us take a closer look at the Links that are relevant for assessing the fairness of the situations examined in the studies at hand, and what they reveal about the limitations of the analyses proposed therein. In [35], the focus is on the possibility that the YouTube recommendation algorithm is biased toward certain sorts of content, thus generating a pattern in which users are ultimately pushed towards a small fraction of the content available on the platform (ContentBias). The Actors identified by the paper, i.e., content creators, con-tent consumers, and YouTube itself, are seen on the background ofYouTube’s revenue model (Context). The platform revenue’s model is largely organized around advertisement revenue, which is shared between the company and the content creators. Thereby, YouTube have an interest in maximizing the time spent by consumers on the platform, thus increasing the amount of advertisement they are exposed to; while content creators have an interest in maximizing the number of platform users that view the content items they produce, thus increasing the share of advertisement revenue they receive from the platform (Resources).Interestingly, the paper seems to place most of the Power in the hands of YouTube itself, insofar as the platform is responsi-ble for the recommendation algorithm that increases the visibility and accessibility of certain content items rather than others. TheACROCPoLis framework, however, invites an examination as well if the Power, if any, that the other Actors possess. First, content creators arguably have an important amount of Power in shaping the allocation and distribution of the relevant Resources (time spent and views by content consumers). Indeed, it is at least in part the attractiveness and interest of the content items they produce that attract consumers to YouTube to start with. Moreover, content creators may aim at creating content items that they believe will attract a larger number of users, in light of their own knowledge about societal trends and public interest in different subject matters. Finally, content creators may partially reverse-engineer some of the Criteria used by YouTube’s recommendation algorithm in order to increase the likelihood of appearing as recommended content to the population of consumers they think might be more attracted to their content items (a sort of Recommender Engine Optimiza-tion). In consequence, content creators should arguably not be seen as passive, powerless Actors in the situation under examination.While their interests partially overlap with those of the platform,they also partially differ, insofar as content creators compete among themselves for the available Resources, while YouTube is mostly interested in overall content consumption on the platform.Similarly, and perhaps more strikingly, content consumers in theplatform are treated as purely passive Actors in the paper. Indeed,the methods used in the research simulate consumers that fullyfollow the deliverances of the recommender algorithm (with some noise added), thus being largely deprived of any Power in deciding what content to consume, and for how long. This is an oversim-plification that the authors acknowledge, but it risks neglecting relevant Links that are central to the assessment of the fairness of the outputs of YouTube’s recommender algorithm. Content consumers have at least some degree of autonomy in selecting the content items to consume, and which recommendations to follow or to ignore. Importantly, they may thus influence the Criteria embodied in the recommender algorithm itself. It is indeed in the interest of YouTube to generate recommendations that mirror the type of content that consumers may want to engage with, and it is hence to be expected that the algorithm responds to the patterns of consumer preference in the platform. Moreover, the large amount of data that Alphabet, the owner of YouTube, possesses about eachuser of its services allows considerable personalization of content recommendations. However, as the authors admit, studying the influence of personalization on the recommendations produced byYouTube is very challenging. In brief, through the Power content consumers possess by means of their consumption preferences, they likely influence the Criteria (i.e., the features used by the recommendation algorithm) that lead to the observed Outcomes(i.e., recommendations that encourage consumers to view a small fraction of the content items available).The above considerations suggest that an assessment of whether or not the content bias found by the researchers is unfair or else requires a fuller picture of the Power the relevant Actors possess, and how they shape the Criteria that produce the content bias found by the study. It may well be, for example, that no unfairness is involved, say, if what the recommendation algorithm does is to successfully draw users toward content items that they are more likely to want to consume. Given the varying quality of the content items avail-able, the variety of subject matters treated in such content items,and social trends that help determine what is or is not in the ’public eye’, it is arguably expected that relatively few content items are taken to be particularly interesting by content consumers. In other words, YouTube’s recommender algorithm might be appropriately promoting content items with higher relevance, interest, and qual-ity. Importantly, we are not claiming that this is the case. Our claims merely that the paper leaves under defined several ACROPoLis components and Links that are crucial to a satisfying assessment of the fairness of the situation being examined. Analogous considerations apply to [40]. The result of the paper that concerns us here is the finding that YouTube’s search algorithm shows a bias toward placing more left-leaning content among the top three search results on the platform than would be expected inlight of the relative representation of political leanings among con-tent items. One central methodological choice in the paper is that of inferring the distribution of political leanings across the YouTubeuser base in the US from the political leanings found in the sample of content items examined in the study. Under the ACROPoLis framework, this methodological choice is far from inconsequential,since it involves a conflation between two different Actor categories that are non-overlapping and that have partially incompatible in-terests and Power, namely content creators, and content consumers.Content creators are plausibly interested in maximizing the view-ership of their content items, and content consumers are interested in consuming the content items that they find most interesting, en-tertaining, or informative. While this suggests that content creators should aim at satisfying consumer preferences, the goals of content creators can also involve other considerations, such as popularizing minority positions, spreading relatively neglected ideas and ideolo-gies, and the like. In other words, it is plausible that the political leanings expressed by content producers are not an appropriate measure of the political leanings of content consumers. As the ACROCPoLis analysis makes clear, content creators and content consumers are different Actors, who possess different kinds and degrees of Power in shaping the search ranking algorithm (Cri-teria) and thus the Outcomes. Thereby, the study results could almost be used to argue that there is an unfair bias in top 3 search results in the US under a uniform distribution understanding of fairness (i.e., equal exposure to be given to each political leaning,regardless of representativeness in the population). It is doubtful,however, that uniform distribution is the appropriate approach to fairness to be used in this case, as it would also require YouTube to give space to extreme political positions that have little representa-tion in the general population.As with [35], this study does not take into consideration the role of content consumers in shaping the search ranking algorithm that YouTube employs. As the authors admit, this is a limitation of the study, for if the political bias found is mostly due to consumer preferences, it is debatable that such a bias is unfair at all, rather than being an expression of the Power exercised by content con-sumers over the search ranking algorithm (and thus over YouTubeitself) by means of their autonomous consumption choices. Bothpapers, moreover, do not go into the role that policymakers have in shaping the Criteria, and thus the Outcomes. This neglect is ar-guably justified, insofar as, at least in solidly democratic countries,policy interventions are mostly concerned with illegal and harmful content, while free speech guarantees make it so that policymakers have little Power when it comes to influencing the Criteria andOutcomes involving legal content items.Importantly, the considerations above are not meant to diminish the value of the studies examined. They are merely intended as illustrations of how the ACROCPoLis framework can help furnish a fuller picture of what pieces of information are needed in order to provide more strongly substantiated fairness assessments of specific situations and processes. Indeed, the ACROCPoLis analyzes abovepoint out limitations in the studies examined, thus revealing further research questions that need to be explored to complement their findings.Finally, it should not have escaped the reader’s attention that glaring gap in the foregoing examination, and in the studies themselves, is the Criteria component. This is due to the fact thatYouTube’s algorithms are proprietary and closed, making it so that the Power that different Actors exercise in shaping it, as well as how the algorithms lead to the observed outcomes, is only partially inferrable by input-output testing of the platform. Moreover, it's likely that YouTube’s algorithms are constantly in flux, with fixes and tweaks introduced by the company to improve their working inlight of the platform’s interests and the regulatory requirements it is called by policymakers to respect. This makes it so that a fully adequate fairness assessment of YouTube, by the lights of ACROCPoLis,cannot currently be produced. As an aside, it is worthwhile to point out that the counterfactual scenario in which YouTube’s algorithm are made openly available, either by the company or by successful reverse-engineering, would importantly change the ACROPoLis analysis. After all, it is plausible that in such a situation more of thePower would move to the hands of content creators, hence changing the Outcomes produced (potentially in undesirable and/or unfairways).

[35] investigate the structure of recommendation networks, and probabilistic distribution of video recommendations from a given node in the network. Recommendation graphs are con-structed based on eight different real-world scenarios (seed video sources) to then apply a stochastic approach and observe PageR-ank [47, 48] distributions over such graphs. The study found that a small fraction of the nodes in the recommendation network received the large majority of connections, suggesting that YouTube’srecommendation algorithm is biased toward a small number of content items available on the platform. Lutz et al. [40] examine political bias in YouTube’s recommen-dation and search algorithms from a US-centered, binary (right-leaning vs left-leaning) perspective. Search and recommendations were studied in separate experiments. We will be concerned exclusively with the study on the search algorithm. For that experiment, the authors scraped the 200 top search results for a variety of politically-charged terms in the US public debate, using fourYouTube accounts with different viewing profiles create for the experiment. The top search results for each term and each profile were evaluated for their political leaning. The study found that left-leaning content items were significantly more likely to appear among the three top search results. Do these studies indicate unfair biases in YouTube’s search and recommendation algorithms? Let us use the ACROCPoLis frame-work to examine these cases in detail, starting from the identifica-tion of the relevant components.In Table 1, the ACROCPoLis framework is used to describe the fairness-relevant components extracted from both articles. In addition to identifying the components playing a role in each paper, let us take a closer look at the Links that are relevant for assessing the fairness of the situations examined in the studies at hand, and what they reveal about the limitations of the analyses proposed therein. In [35], the focus is on the possibility that the YouTube recommendation algorithm is biased toward certain sorts of content, thus generating a pattern in which users are ultimately pushed towards a small fraction of the content available on the platform (ContentBias). The Actors identified by the paper, i.e., content creators, con-tent consumers, and YouTube itself, are seen on the background ofYouTube’s revenue model (Context). The platform revenue’s model is largely organized around advertisement revenue, which is shared between the company and the content creators. Thereby, YouTube have an interest in maximizing the time spent by consumers on the platform, thus increasing the amount of advertisement they are exposed to; while content creators have an interest in maximizing the number of platform users that view the content items they produce, thus increasing the share of advertisement revenue they receive from the platform (Resources).Interestingly, the paper seems to place most of the Power in the hands of YouTube itself, insofar as the platform is responsi-ble for the recommendation algorithm that increases the visibility and accessibility of certain content items rather than others. TheACROCPoLis framework, however, invites an examination as well if the Power, if any, that the other Actors possess. First, content creators arguably have an important amount of Power in shaping the allocation and distribution of the relevant Resources (time spent and views by content consumers). Indeed, it is at least in part the attractiveness and interest of the content items they produce that attract consumers to YouTube to start with. Moreover, content creators may aim at creating content items that they believe will attract a larger number of users, in light of their own knowledge about societal trends and public interest in different subject matters. Finally, content creators may partially reverse-engineer some of the Criteria used by YouTube’s recommendation algorithm in order to increase the likelihood of appearing as recommended content to the population of consumers they think might be more attracted to their content items (a sort of Recommender Engine Optimiza-tion). In consequence, content creators should arguably not be seen as passive, powerless Actors in the situation under examination.While their interests partially overlap with those of the platform,they also partially differ, insofar as content creators compete among themselves for the available Resources, while YouTube is mostly interested in overall content consumption on the platform.Similarly, and perhaps more strikingly, content consumers in theplatform are treated as purely passive Actors in the paper. Indeed,the methods used in the research simulate consumers that fullyfollow the deliverances of the recommender algorithm (with some noise added), thus being largely deprived of any Power in deciding what content to consume, and for how long. This is an oversim-plification that the authors acknowledge, but it risks neglecting relevant Links that are central to the assessment of the fairness of the outputs of YouTube’s recommender algorithm. Content consumers have at least some degree of autonomy in selecting the content items to consume, and which recommendations to follow or to ignore. Importantly, they may thus influence the Criteria embodied in the recommender algorithm itself. It is indeed in the interest of YouTube to generate recommendations that mirror the type of content that consumers may want to engage with, and it is hence to be expected that the algorithm responds to the patterns of consumer preference in the platform. Moreover, the large amount of data that Alphabet, the owner of YouTube, possesses about eachuser of its services allows considerable personalization of content recommendations. However, as the authors admit, studying the influence of personalization on the recommendations produced byYouTube is very challenging. In brief, through the Power content consumers possess by means of their consumption preferences, they likely influence the Criteria (i.e., the features used by the recommendation algorithm) that lead to the observed Outcomes(i.e., recommendations that encourage consumers to view a small fraction of the content items available).The above considerations suggest that an assessment of whether or not the content bias found by the researchers is unfair or else requires a fuller picture of the Power the relevant Actors possess, and how they shape the Criteria that produce the content bias found by the study. It may well be, for example, that no unfairness is involved, say, if what the recommendation algorithm does is to successfully draw users toward content items that they are more likely to want to consume. Given the varying quality of the content items avail-able, the variety of subject matters treated in such content items,and social trends that help determine what is or is not in the ’public eye’, it is arguably expected that relatively few content items are taken to be particularly interesting by content consumers. In other words, YouTube’s recommender algorithm might be appropriately promoting content items with higher relevance, interest, and qual-ity. Importantly, we are not claiming that this is the case. Our claims merely that the paper leaves under defined several ACROPoLis components and Links that are crucial to a satisfying assessment of the fairness of the situation being examined. Analogous considerations apply to [40]. The result of the paper that concerns us here is the finding that YouTube’s search algorithm shows a bias toward placing more left-leaning content among the top three search results on the platform than would be expected inlight of the relative representation of political leanings among con-tent items. One central methodological choice in the paper is that of inferring the distribution of political leanings across the YouTubeuser base in the US from the political leanings found in the sample of content items examined in the study. Under the ACROPoLis framework, this methodological choice is far from inconsequential,since it involves a conflation between two different Actor categories that are non-overlapping and that have partially incompatible in-terests and Power, namely content creators, and content consumers.Content creators are plausibly interested in maximizing the view-ership of their content items, and content consumers are interested in consuming the content items that they find most interesting, en-tertaining, or informative. While this suggests that content creators should aim at satisfying consumer preferences, the goals of content creators can also involve other considerations, such as popularizing minority positions, spreading relatively neglected ideas and ideolo-gies, and the like. In other words, it is plausible that the political leanings expressed by content producers are not an appropriate measure of the political leanings of content consumers. As the ACROCPoLis analysis makes clear, content creators and content consumers are different Actors, who possess different kinds and degrees of Power in shaping the search ranking algorithm (Cri-teria) and thus the Outcomes. Thereby, the study results could almost be used to argue that there is an unfair bias in top 3 search results in the US under a uniform distribution understanding of fairness (i.e., equal exposure to be given to each political leaning,regardless of representativeness in the population). It is doubtful,however, that uniform distribution is the appropriate approach to fairness to be used in this case, as it would also require YouTube to give space to extreme political positions that have little representa-tion in the general population.As with [35], this study does not take into consideration the role of content consumers in shaping the search ranking algorithm that YouTube employs. As the authors admit, this is a limitation of the study, for if the political bias found is mostly due to consumer preferences, it is debatable that such a bias is unfair at all, rather than being an expression of the Power exercised by content con-sumers over the search ranking algorithm (and thus over YouTubeitself) by means of their autonomous consumption choices. Bothpapers, moreover, do not go into the role that policymakers have in shaping the Criteria, and thus the Outcomes. This neglect is ar-guably justified, insofar as, at least in solidly democratic countries,policy interventions are mostly concerned with illegal and harmful content, while free speech guarantees make it so that policymakers have little Power when it comes to influencing the Criteria andOutcomes involving legal content items.Importantly, the considerations above are not meant to diminish the value of the studies examined. They are merely intended as illustrations of how the ACROCPoLis framework can help furnish a fuller picture of what pieces of information are needed in order to provide more strongly substantiated fairness assessments of specific situations and processes. Indeed, the ACROCPoLis analyzes abovepoint out limitations in the studies examined, thus revealing further research questions that need to be explored to complement their findings.Finally, it should not have escaped the reader’s attention that glaring gap in the foregoing examination, and in the studies themselves, is the Criteria component. This is due to the fact thatYouTube’s algorithms are proprietary and closed, making it so that the Power that different Actors exercise in shaping it, as well as how the algorithms lead to the observed outcomes, is only partially inferrable by input-output testing of the platform. Moreover, it's likely that YouTube’s algorithms are constantly in flux, with fixes and tweaks introduced by the company to improve their working inlight of the platform’s interests and the regulatory requirements it is called by policymakers to respect. This makes it so that a fully adequate fairness assessment of YouTube, by the lights of ACROCPoLis,cannot currently be produced. As an aside, it is worthwhile to point out that the counterfactual scenario in which YouTube’s algorithm are made openly available, either by the company or by successful reverse-engineering, would importantly change the ACROPoLis analysis. After all, it is plausible that in such a situation more of thePower would move to the hands of content creators, hence changing the Outcomes produced (potentially in undesirable and/or unfairways).

For that experiment, the authors scraped the 200 top search results for a variety of politically-charged terms in the US public debate, using fourYouTube accounts with different viewing profiles create for the experiment. The top search results for each term and each profile were evaluated for their political leaning. The study found that left-leaning content items were significantly more likely to appear among the three top search results. Do these studies indicate unfair biases in YouTube’s search and recommendation algorithms? Let us use the ACROCPoLis frame-work to examine these cases in detail, starting from the identifica-tion of the relevant components.In Table 1, the ACROCPoLis framework is used to describe the fairness-relevant components extracted from both articles. In addition to identifying the components playing a role in each paper, let us take a closer look at the Links that are relevant for assessing the fairness of the situations examined in the studies at hand, and what they reveal about the limitations of the analyses proposed therein. In [35], the focus is on the possibility that the YouTube recommendation algorithm is biased toward certain sorts of content, thus generating a pattern in which users are ultimately pushed towards a small fraction of the content available on the platform (ContentBias). The Actors identified by the paper, i.e., content creators, con-tent consumers, and YouTube itself, are seen on the background ofYouTube’s revenue model (Context). The platform revenue’s model is largely organized around advertisement revenue, which is shared between the company and the content creators. Thereby, YouTube have an interest in maximizing the time spent by consumers on the platform, thus increasing the amount of advertisement they are exposed to; while content creators have an interest in maximizing the number of platform users that view the content items they produce, thus increasing the share of advertisement revenue they receive from the platform (Resources).Interestingly, the paper seems to place most of the Power in the hands of YouTube itself, insofar as the platform is responsi-ble for the recommendation algorithm that increases the visibility and accessibility of certain content items rather than others. TheACROCPoLis framework, however, invites an examination as well if the Power, if any, that the other Actors possess. First, content creators arguably have an important amount of Power in shaping the allocation and distribution of the relevant Resources (time spent and views by content consumers). Indeed, it is at least in part the attractiveness and interest of the content items they produce that attract consumers to YouTube to start with. Moreover, content creators may aim at creating content items that they believe will attract a larger number of users, in light of their own knowledge about societal trends and public interest in different subject matters. Finally, content creators may partially reverse-engineer some of the Criteria used by YouTube’s recommendation algorithm in order to increase the likelihood of appearing as recommended content to the population of consumers they think might be more attracted to their content items (a sort of Recommender Engine Optimiza-tion). In consequence, content creators should arguably not be seen as passive, powerless Actors in the situation under examination.While their interests partially overlap with those of the platform,they also partially differ, insofar as content creators compete among themselves for the available Resources, while YouTube is mostly interested in overall content consumption on the platform.Similarly, and perhaps more strikingly, content consumers in theplatform are treated as purely passive Actors in the paper. Indeed,the methods used in the research simulate consumers that fullyfollow the deliverances of the recommender algorithm (with some noise added), thus being largely deprived of any Power in deciding what content to consume, and for how long. This is an oversim-plification that the authors acknowledge, but it risks neglecting relevant Links that are central to the assessment of the fairness of the outputs of YouTube’s recommender algorithm. Content consumers have at least some degree of autonomy in selecting the content items to consume, and which recommendations to follow or to ignore. Importantly, they may thus influence the Criteria embodied in the recommender algorithm itself. It is indeed in the interest of YouTube to generate recommendations that mirror the type of content that consumers may want to engage with, and it is hence to be expected that the algorithm responds to the patterns of consumer preference in the platform. Moreover, the large amount of data that Alphabet, the owner of YouTube, possesses about eachuser of its services allows considerable personalization of content recommendations. However, as the authors admit, studying the influence of personalization on the recommendations produced byYouTube is very challenging. In brief, through the Power content consumers possess by means of their consumption preferences, they likely influence the Criteria (i.e., the features used by the recommendation algorithm) that lead to the observed Outcomes(i.e., recommendations that encourage consumers to view a small fraction of the content items available).The above considerations suggest that an assessment of whether or not the content bias found by the researchers is unfair or else requires a fuller picture of the Power the relevant Actors possess, and how they shape the Criteria that produce the content bias found by the study. It may well be, for example, that no unfairness is involved, say, if what the recommendation algorithm does is to successfully draw users toward content items that they are more likely to want to consume. Given the varying quality of the content items avail-able, the variety of subject matters treated in such content items,and social trends that help determine what is or is not in the ’public eye’, it is arguably expected that relatively few content items are taken to be particularly interesting by content consumers. In other words, YouTube’s recommender algorithm might be appropriately promoting content items with higher relevance, interest, and qual-ity. Importantly, we are not claiming that this is the case. Our claims merely that the paper leaves under defined several ACROPoLis components and Links that are crucial to a satisfying assessment of the fairness of the situation being examined. Analogous considerations apply to [40]. The result of the paper that concerns us here is the finding that YouTube’s search algorithm shows a bias toward placing more left-leaning content among the top three search results on the platform than would be expected inlight of the relative representation of political leanings among con-tent items. One central methodological choice in the paper is that of inferring the distribution of political leanings across the YouTubeuser base in the US from the political leanings found in the sample of content items examined in the study. Under the ACROPoLis framework, this methodological choice is far from inconsequential,since it involves a conflation between two different Actor categories that are non-overlapping and that have partially incompatible in-terests and Power, namely content creators, and content consumers.Content creators are plausibly interested in maximizing the view-ership of their content items, and content consumers are interested in consuming the content items that they find most interesting, en-tertaining, or informative. While this suggests that content creators should aim at satisfying consumer preferences, the goals of content creators can also involve other considerations, such as popularizing minority positions, spreading relatively neglected ideas and ideolo-gies, and the like. In other words, it is plausible that the political leanings expressed by content producers are not an appropriate measure of the political leanings of content consumers. As the ACROCPoLis analysis makes clear, content creators and content consumers are different Actors, who possess different kinds and degrees of Power in shaping the search ranking algorithm (Cri-teria) and thus the Outcomes. Thereby, the study results could almost be used to argue that there is an unfair bias in top 3 search results in the US under a uniform distribution understanding of fairness (i.e., equal exposure to be given to each political leaning,regardless of representativeness in the population). It is doubtful,however, that uniform distribution is the appropriate approach to fairness to be used in this case, as it would also require YouTube to give space to extreme political positions that have little representa-tion in the general population.As with [35], this study does not take into consideration the role of content consumers in shaping the search ranking algorithm that YouTube employs. As the authors admit, this is a limitation of the study, for if the political bias found is mostly due to consumer preferences, it is debatable that such a bias is unfair at all, rather than being an expression of the Power exercised by content con-sumers over the search ranking algorithm (and thus over YouTubeitself) by means of their autonomous consumption choices. Bothpapers, moreover, do not go into the role that policymakers have in shaping the Criteria, and thus the Outcomes. This neglect is ar-guably justified, insofar as, at least in solidly democratic countries,policy interventions are mostly concerned with illegal and harmful content, while free speech guarantees make it so that policymakers have little Power when it comes to influencing the Criteria andOutcomes involving legal content items.Importantly, the considerations above are not meant to diminish the value of the studies examined. They are merely intended as illustrations of how the ACROCPoLis framework can help furnish a fuller picture of what pieces of information are needed in order to provide more strongly substantiated fairness assessments of specific situations and processes. Indeed, the ACROCPoLis analyzes abovepoint out limitations in the studies examined, thus revealing further research questions that need to be explored to complement their findings.Finally, it should not have escaped the reader’s attention that glaring gap in the foregoing examination, and in the studies themselves, is the Criteria component. This is due to the fact thatYouTube’s algorithms are proprietary and closed, making it so that the Power that different Actors exercise in shaping it, as well as how the algorithms lead to the observed outcomes, is only partially inferrable by input-output testing of the platform. Moreover, it's likely that YouTube’s algorithms are constantly in flux, with fixes and tweaks introduced by the company to improve their working inlight of the platform’s interests and the regulatory requirements it is called by policymakers to respect. This makes it so that a fully adequate fairness assessment of YouTube, by the lights of ACROCPoLis,cannot currently be produced. As an aside, it is worthwhile to point out that the counterfactual scenario in which YouTube’s algorithm are made openly available, either by the company or by successful reverse-engineering, would importantly change the ACROPoLis analysis. After all, it is plausible that in such a situation more of thePower would move to the hands of content creators, hence changing the Outcomes produced (potentially in undesirable and/or unfairways).

YouTube’s algorithms are proprietary (closed-source and not documented in a transparent manner from a user or public perspective). This opacity has triggered studies into the features of the algorithms as well as the consequences of their operations within the platform, based on publicly accessible facts [3, 53].Two such studies are examined here: the first study focuses on examining the question of whether the YouTube recommendation algorithm favors a small subset of the video content available on the platform [35]; and the second examines whether YouTube’ssearch algorithm is biased toward video content associated with specific positions on the United States political spectrum [40].Kirdemir et al. [35] investigate the structure of recommendation networks, and probabilistic distribution of video recommendations from a given node in the network. Recommendation graphs are con-structed based on eight different real-world scenarios (seed video sources) to then apply a stochastic approach and observe PageR-ank [47, 48] distributions over such graphs. The study found that a small fraction of the nodes in the recommendation network received the large majority of connections, suggesting that YouTube’srecommendation algorithm is biased toward a small number of content items available on the platform.

Let us use the ACROCPoLis frame-work to examine these cases in detail, starting from the identifica-tion of the relevant components.In Table 1, the ACROCPoLis framework is used to describe the fairness-relevant components extracted from both articles. In addition to identifying the components playing a role in each paper, let us take a closer look at the Links that are relevant for assessing the fairness of the situations examined in the studies at hand, and what they reveal about the limitations of the analyses proposed therein. In [35], the focus is on the possibility that the YouTube recommendation algorithm is biased toward certain sorts of content, thus generating a pattern in which users are ultimately pushed towards a small fraction of the content available on the platform (ContentBias). The Actors identified by the paper, i.e., content creators, con-tent consumers, and YouTube itself, are seen on the background ofYouTube’s revenue model (Context). The platform revenue’s model is largely organized around advertisement revenue, which is shared between the company and the content creators. Thereby, YouTube have an interest in maximizing the time spent by consumers on the platform, thus increasing the amount of advertisement they are exposed to; while content creators have an interest in maximizing the number of platform users that view the content items they produce, thus increasing the share of advertisement revenue they receive from the platform (Resources).Interestingly, the paper seems to place most of the Power in the hands of YouTube itself, insofar as the platform is responsi-ble for the recommendation algorithm that increases the visibility and accessibility of certain content items rather than others. TheACROCPoLis framework, however, invites an examination as well if the Power, if any, that the other Actors possess. First, content creators arguably have an important amount of Power in shaping the allocation and distribution of the relevant Resources (time spent and views by content consumers). Indeed, it is at least in part the attractiveness and interest of the content items they produce that attract consumers to YouTube to start with. Moreover, content creators may aim at creating content items that they believe will attract a larger number of users, in light of their own knowledge about societal trends and public interest in different subject matters. Finally, content creators may partially reverse-engineer some of the Criteria used by YouTube’s recommendation algorithm in order to increase the likelihood of appearing as recommended content to the population of consumers they think might be more attracted to their content items (a sort of Recommender Engine Optimiza-tion). In consequence, content creators should arguably not be seen as passive, powerless Actors in the situation under examination.While their interests partially overlap with those of the platform,they also partially differ, insofar as content creators compete among themselves for the available Resources, while YouTube is mostly interested in overall content consumption on the platform.Similarly, and perhaps more strikingly, content consumers in theplatform are treated as purely passive Actors in the paper. Indeed,the methods used in the research simulate consumers that fullyfollow the deliverances of the recommender algorithm (with some noise added), thus being largely deprived of any Power in deciding what content to consume, and for how long. This is an oversim-plification that the authors acknowledge, but it risks neglecting relevant Links that are central to the assessment of the fairness of the outputs of YouTube’s recommender algorithm. Content consumers have at least some degree of autonomy in selecting the content items to consume, and which recommendations to follow or to ignore. Importantly, they may thus influence the Criteria embodied in the recommender algorithm itself. It is indeed in the interest of YouTube to generate recommendations that mirror the type of content that consumers may want to engage with, and it is hence to be expected that the algorithm responds to the patterns of consumer preference in the platform. Moreover, the large amount of data that Alphabet, the owner of YouTube, possesses about eachuser of its services allows considerable personalization of content recommendations. However, as the authors admit, studying the influence of personalization on the recommendations produced byYouTube is very challenging. In brief, through the Power content consumers possess by means of their consumption preferences, they likely influence the Criteria (i.e., the features used by the recommendation algorithm) that lead to the observed Outcomes(i.e., recommendations that encourage consumers to view a small fraction of the content items available).The above considerations suggest that an assessment of whether or not the content bias found by the researchers is unfair or else requires a fuller picture of the Power the relevant Actors possess, and how they shape the Criteria that produce the content bias found by the study. It may well be, for example, that no unfairness is involved, say, if what the recommendation algorithm does is to successfully draw users toward content items that they are more likely to want to consume. Given the varying quality of the content items avail-able, the variety of subject matters treated in such content items,and social trends that help determine what is or is not in the ’public eye’, it is arguably expected that relatively few content items are taken to be particularly interesting by content consumers. In other words, YouTube’s recommender algorithm might be appropriately promoting content items with higher relevance, interest, and qual-ity. Importantly, we are not claiming that this is the case. Our claims merely that the paper leaves under defined several ACROPoLis components and Links that are crucial to a satisfying assessment of the fairness of the situation being examined. Analogous considerations apply to [40]. The result of the paper that concerns us here is the finding that YouTube’s search algorithm shows a bias toward placing more left-leaning content among the top three search results on the platform than would be expected inlight of the relative representation of political leanings among con-tent items. One central methodological choice in the paper is that of inferring the distribution of political leanings across the YouTubeuser base in the US from the political leanings found in the sample of content items examined in the study. Under the ACROPoLis framework, this methodological choice is far from inconsequential,since it involves a conflation between two different Actor categories that are non-overlapping and that have partially incompatible in-terests and Power, namely content creators, and content consumers.Content creators are plausibly interested in maximizing the view-ership of their content items, and content consumers are interested in consuming the content items that they find most interesting, en-tertaining, or informative. While this suggests that content creators should aim at satisfying consumer preferences, the goals of content creators can also involve other considerations, such as popularizing minority positions, spreading relatively neglected ideas and ideolo-gies, and the like. In other words, it is plausible that the political leanings expressed by content producers are not an appropriate measure of the political leanings of content consumers. As the ACROCPoLis analysis makes clear, content creators and content consumers are different Actors, who possess different kinds and degrees of Power in shaping the search ranking algorithm (Cri-teria) and thus the Outcomes. Thereby, the study results could almost be used to argue that there is an unfair bias in top 3 search results in the US under a uniform distribution understanding of fairness (i.e., equal exposure to be given to each political leaning,regardless of representativeness in the population). It is doubtful,however, that uniform distribution is the appropriate approach to fairness to be used in this case, as it would also require YouTube to give space to extreme political positions that have little representa-tion in the general population.As with [35], this study does not take into consideration the role of content consumers in shaping the search ranking algorithm that YouTube employs. As the authors admit, this is a limitation of the study, for if the political bias found is mostly due to consumer preferences, it is debatable that such a bias is unfair at all, rather than being an expression of the Power exercised by content con-sumers over the search ranking algorithm (and thus over YouTubeitself) by means of their autonomous consumption choices. Bothpapers, moreover, do not go into the role that policymakers have in shaping the Criteria, and thus the Outcomes. This neglect is ar-guably justified, insofar as, at least in solidly democratic countries,policy interventions are mostly concerned with illegal and harmful content, while free speech guarantees make it so that policymakers have little Power when it comes to influencing the Criteria andOutcomes involving legal content items.Importantly, the considerations above are not meant to diminish the value of the studies examined. They are merely intended as illustrations of how the ACROCPoLis framework can help furnish a fuller picture of what pieces of information are needed in order to provide more strongly substantiated fairness assessments of specific situations and processes. Indeed, the ACROCPoLis analyzes abovepoint out limitations in the studies examined, thus revealing further research questions that need to be explored to complement their findings.Finally, it should not have escaped the reader’s attention that glaring gap in the foregoing examination, and in the studies themselves, is the Criteria component. This is due to the fact thatYouTube’s algorithms are proprietary and closed, making it so that the Power that different Actors exercise in shaping it, as well as how the algorithms lead to the observed outcomes, is only partially inferrable by input-output testing of the platform. Moreover, it's likely that YouTube’s algorithms are constantly in flux, with fixes and tweaks introduced by the company to improve their working inlight of the platform’s interests and the regulatory requirements it is called by policymakers to respect. This makes it so that a fully adequate fairness assessment of YouTube, by the lights of ACROCPoLis,cannot currently be produced. As an aside, it is worthwhile to point out that the counterfactual scenario in which YouTube’s algorithm are made openly available, either by the company or by successful reverse-engineering, would importantly change the ACROPoLis analysis. After all, it is plausible that in such a situation more of thePower would move to the hands of content creators, hence changing the Outcomes produced (potentially in undesirable and/or unfairways).

25,ContentCreators,hasProducedArtifact,PopularItems,"To further illustrate the use of ACROCPoLis, let us examine recent work on the search and recommendation algorithms of the video platform YouTube, and how they are analyzed in terms of fairness in the literature. YouTube’s algorithms are proprietary (closed-source and not documented in a transparent manner from a user or public perspective). This opacity has triggered studies into the features of the algorithms as well as the consequences of their operations within the platform, based on publicly accessible facts [3, 53].Two such studies are examined here: the first study focuses on examining the question of whether the YouTube recommendation algorithm favors a small subset of the video content available on the platform [35]; and the second examines whether YouTube’ssearch algorithm is biased toward video content associated with specific positions on the United States political spectrum [40].Kirdemir et al. [35] investigate the structure of recommendation networks, and probabilistic distribution of video recommendations from a given node in the network. Recommendation graphs are con-structed based on eight different real-world scenarios (seed video sources) to then apply a stochastic approach and observe PageR-ank [47, 48] distributions over such graphs. The study found that a small fraction of the nodes in the recommendation network received the large majority of connections, suggesting that YouTube’srecommendation algorithm is biased toward a small number of content items available on the platform. Lutz et al. [40] examine political bias in YouTube’s recommen-dation and search algorithms from a US-centered, binary (right-leaning vs left-leaning) perspective. Search and recommendations were studied in separate experiments. We will be concerned exclusively with the study on the search algorithm. For that experiment, the authors scraped the 200 top search results for a variety of politically-charged terms in the US public debate, using fourYouTube accounts with different viewing profiles create for the experiment. The top search results for each term and each profile were evaluated for their political leaning. The study found that left-leaning content items were significantly more likely to appear among the three top search results.

The Actors identified by the paper, i.e., content creators, con-tent consumers, and YouTube itself, are seen on the background ofYouTube’s revenue model (Context). The platform revenue’s model is largely organized around advertisement revenue, which is shared between the company and the content creators. Thereby, YouTube have an interest in maximizing the time spent by consumers on the platform, thus increasing the amount of advertisement they are exposed to; while content creators have an interest in maximizing the number of platform users that view the content items they produce, thus increasing the share of advertisement revenue they receive from the platform (Resources).Interestingly, the paper seems to place most of the Power in the hands of YouTube itself, insofar as the platform is responsi-ble for the recommendation algorithm that increases the visibility and accessibility of certain content items rather than others. TheACROCPoLis framework, however, invites an examination as well if the Power, if any, that the other Actors possess. First, content creators arguably have an important amount of Power in shaping the allocation and distribution of the relevant Resources (time spent and views by content consumers). Indeed, it is at least in part the attractiveness and interest of the content items they produce that attract consumers to YouTube to start with. Moreover, content creators may aim at creating content items that they believe will attract a larger number of users, in light of their own knowledge about societal trends and public interest in different subject matters. Finally, content creators may partially reverse-engineer some of the Criteria used by YouTube’s recommendation algorithm in order to increase the likelihood of appearing as recommended content to the population of consumers they think might be more attracted to their content items (a sort of Recommender Engine Optimiza-tion). In consequence, content creators should arguably not be seen as passive, powerless Actors in the situation under examination.While their interests partially overlap with those of the platform,they also partially differ, insofar as content creators compete among themselves for the available Resources, while YouTube is mostly interested in overall content consumption on the platform.Similarly, and perhaps more strikingly, content consumers in theplatform are treated as purely passive Actors in the paper. Indeed,the methods used in the research simulate consumers that fullyfollow the deliverances of the recommender algorithm (with some noise added), thus being largely deprived of any Power in deciding what content to consume, and for how long. This is an oversim-plification that the authors acknowledge, but it risks neglecting relevant Links that are central to the assessment of the fairness of the outputs of YouTube’s recommender algorithm. Content consumers have at least some degree of autonomy in selecting the content items to consume, and which recommendations to follow or to ignore. Importantly, they may thus influence the Criteria embodied in the recommender algorithm itself. It is indeed in the interest of YouTube to generate recommendations that mirror the type of content that consumers may want to engage with, and it is hence to be expected that the algorithm responds to the patterns of consumer preference in the platform. Moreover, the large amount of data that Alphabet, the owner of YouTube, possesses about eachuser of its services allows considerable personalization of content recommendations. However, as the authors admit, studying the influence of personalization on the recommendations produced byYouTube is very challenging. In brief, through the Power content consumers possess by means of their consumption preferences, they likely influence the Criteria (i.e., the features used by the recommendation algorithm) that lead to the observed Outcomes(i.e., recommendations that encourage consumers to view a small fraction of the content items available).The above considerations suggest that an assessment of whether or not the content bias found by the researchers is unfair or else requires a fuller picture of the Power the relevant Actors possess, and how they shape the Criteria that produce the content bias found by the study. It may well be, for example, that no unfairness is involved, say, if what the recommendation algorithm does is to successfully draw users toward content items that they are more likely to want to consume. Given the varying quality of the content items avail-able, the variety of subject matters treated in such content items,and social trends that help determine what is or is not in the ’public eye’, it is arguably expected that relatively few content items are taken to be particularly interesting by content consumers. In other words, YouTube’s recommender algorithm might be appropriately promoting content items with higher relevance, interest, and qual-ity. Importantly, we are not claiming that this is the case. Our claims merely that the paper leaves under defined several ACROPoLis components and Links that are crucial to a satisfying assessment of the fairness of the situation being examined. Analogous considerations apply to [40]. The result of the paper that concerns us here is the finding that YouTube’s search algorithm shows a bias toward placing more left-leaning content among the top three search results on the platform than would be expected inlight of the relative representation of political leanings among con-tent items. One central methodological choice in the paper is that of inferring the distribution of political leanings across the YouTubeuser base in the US from the political leanings found in the sample of content items examined in the study. Under the ACROPoLis framework, this methodological choice is far from inconsequential,since it involves a conflation between two different Actor categories that are non-overlapping and that have partially incompatible in-terests and Power, namely content creators, and content consumers.Content creators are plausibly interested in maximizing the view-ership of their content items, and content consumers are interested in consuming the content items that they find most interesting, en-tertaining, or informative. While this suggests that content creators should aim at satisfying consumer preferences, the goals of content creators can also involve other considerations, such as popularizing minority positions, spreading relatively neglected ideas and ideolo-gies, and the like. In other words, it is plausible that the political leanings expressed by content producers are not an appropriate measure of the political leanings of content consumers. As the ACROCPoLis analysis makes clear, content creators and content consumers are different Actors, who possess different kinds and degrees of Power in shaping the search ranking algorithm (Cri-teria) and thus the Outcomes. Thereby, the study results could almost be used to argue that there is an unfair bias in top 3 search results in the US under a uniform distribution understanding of fairness (i.e., equal exposure to be given to each political leaning,regardless of representativeness in the population). It is doubtful,however, that uniform distribution is the appropriate approach to fairness to be used in this case, as it would also require YouTube to give space to extreme political positions that have little representa-tion in the general population.As with [35], this study does not take into consideration the role of content consumers in shaping the search ranking algorithm that YouTube employs. As the authors admit, this is a limitation of the study, for if the political bias found is mostly due to consumer preferences, it is debatable that such a bias is unfair at all, rather than being an expression of the Power exercised by content con-sumers over the search ranking algorithm (and thus over YouTubeitself) by means of their autonomous consumption choices. Bothpapers, moreover, do not go into the role that policymakers have in shaping the Criteria, and thus the Outcomes. This neglect is ar-guably justified, insofar as, at least in solidly democratic countries,policy interventions are mostly concerned with illegal and harmful content, while free speech guarantees make it so that policymakers have little Power when it comes to influencing the Criteria andOutcomes involving legal content items.Importantly, the considerations above are not meant to diminish the value of the studies examined. They are merely intended as illustrations of how the ACROCPoLis framework can help furnish a fuller picture of what pieces of information are needed in order to provide more strongly substantiated fairness assessments of specific situations and processes. Indeed, the ACROCPoLis analyzes abovepoint out limitations in the studies examined, thus revealing further research questions that need to be explored to complement their findings.Finally, it should not have escaped the reader’s attention that glaring gap in the foregoing examination, and in the studies themselves, is the Criteria component. This is due to the fact thatYouTube’s algorithms are proprietary and closed, making it so that the Power that different Actors exercise in shaping it, as well as how the algorithms lead to the observed outcomes, is only partially inferrable by input-output testing of the platform. Moreover, it's likely that YouTube’s algorithms are constantly in flux, with fixes and tweaks introduced by the company to improve their working inlight of the platform’s interests and the regulatory requirements it is called by policymakers to respect. This makes it so that a fully adequate fairness assessment of YouTube, by the lights of ACROCPoLis,cannot currently be produced. As an aside, it is worthwhile to point out that the counterfactual scenario in which YouTube’s algorithm are made openly available, either by the company or by successful reverse-engineering, would importantly change the ACROPoLis analysis. After all, it is plausible that in such a situation more of thePower would move to the hands of content creators, hence changing the Outcomes produced (potentially in undesirable and/or unfairways).
