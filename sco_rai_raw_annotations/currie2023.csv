9,UnitedKingdom,Agent,"we draw on an ongoing, empirical study examining Universal Credit (UC), an automated social security payment used in the United Kingdom. UC uses a dynamic, means-testing payment calculation to determine the monthly amount of claim people are entitled to. In this study we use serial interviews plus phone texts as prompts for solicit-ing feedback from users. We argue that ALL provides a unique opportunity to gather information on ADMS, both over time and in situ. Capturing information over time allows for more granular accounts of dynamic trajectories. Through the personal accounts of users reacting in situ, QLR also gives researchers insight into the emotional dimensions of users’ interactions with ADMS.In the following literature review, we cover the challenges schol-ars have confronted while studying ADMS, how scholars have studied users of ADMS to overcome these challenges, and the value and drawbacks of longitudinal research. [...] Administered by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP),Universal Credit is the UK’s largest social security payment. DWPintroduced UC in 2012, and it is set to replace some of the previ-ous benefits by 2024. The DWP terms UC ‘digital-by-default’ [27] since recipients apply for and receive payments through an online account. The account also acts as the primary mode of communica-tion with DWP staff (though people unable to maintain the online account can opt to interact solely by phone). UC is a means-tested and conditional benefit; to qualify, some claimants must work or look for work for a certain number of hours per week, based on their capability to work and certain life circumstances, such as having dependents.This study focuses on an essential automated decision-making feature of UC: its dynamic payment algorithm. UC uses automation to determine the amount of money claimants receive each month,based on calculating data points collected during a prior monthly assessment period. The monthly assessment period is a personal-ized unit of time based on the day a person applied for the benefit –for instance, if a person applies on February 15th, their assessment period will be from the 15th of a given month until the 14th of the next month. Claimants’ start with a ‘minimum standard allowance based on their age and relationship status (either single or living with a partner) and other factors such as disability or number of dependents. Payments will then be adjusted negatively depending on monthly earnings and deductions. Deductions include repayments for advance claims the claimant may have been granted in the past,past overpayments from UC and third-party deductions made at the request of a creditor, including rent arrears, utility arrears, Council Tax bill arrears, child support maintenance and fines by UC.For those working, the adjustments to UC based on monthly earnings happen automatically through a data exchange with theHMRC’s (HM Revenue and Customs) Real Time Information (RTI)system. Employers report their employees’ earnings using payroll software to RTI for tax purposes, and DWP accesses this stream of data daily. A report by Human Rights Watch [72] uses the metaphor of a camera to describe how STI affects the UC monthly assessment period:If the RTI system is a camera, the assessment period functions like a timer that tells it when to take a photo.The resulting snapshot is the earnings data that Universal Credit’s algorithm uses to calculate an individ-ual’s benefit payment for that month.UC considers all income that is reported to HMRC for self-reported by the claimant to UC during each monthly assessment period,and the UC payment decreases accordingly. After the monthly assessment of earnings, most claimants in the UK receive their payment once a month. In Scotland, people can choose to receive their monthly pay in two, approximately bi-weekly instalments.One goal of UC’s month-to-month calculation, based on actual earnings, is to eliminate some of the problems claimants faced withUK’s legacy social security systems. A previous benefit, WorkingTax Credits, had based claimants’ monthly payment on an average of earnings from the past year as reported to HMRC, and this aver-age could over- or under-estimated the benefit owed if a claimant's earnings changed. The discrepancies in reported versus actual earn-ings led claimants into debt to DWP if their earnings fell and rose but their tax credit payment stayed the same. UC aims to eliminate over- or under-payments to claimants – and falling into arrears toDWP – and reduce the burden on claimants to report changes in earnings [49]. DWP publishes very little documentation about UC’s perfor-mance data, “despite the evidence that the Universal Credit team have built up a modern analytics capability where real-time data would be the expectation” [57] (p.70). Likewise, it does not publish any public domain data about its digital services, with the exception of blog and a smattering of one-off research projects [3] nor about their source code [57]. While DWP has consulted the researchers of this project and asked us for updates on our findings in the form of reports, they did not agree to formal interviews about how the system works. Conducting research that can account for the experiences of people who claim Universal Credit is particularly crucial given DWP’s lack of transparency about how they study and understand the user experience. As will be shown later through the use of screenshots, our research gained insight into the interac-tion between claimants and social security agents, a largely unseen aspect of social security.In the following sections, we demonstrate how ALL methods focused on users of ADMS can be a powerful approach to collect data about systems, such as UC, that are highly complex and pose problems of access. [...] The data presented in this paper is from an ongoing qualitative, lon-gitudinal panel study conducted as part of a larger project exploring the lived experiences of recipients of UC.Our panel study commenced in mid-2022 and is expected to run until the end of 2023; this paper reports on data collected in the first six-month period of the study from participants who were recruited in 2022. The study applies two distinct methods of qualitative data collection for each participant: 1. semi-structured interviews and2. bi-weekly prompted updates sent over phone text asking about participants' interactions with UC.We recruited twenty-six participants through local charities by participating in their in-person events and by advertising the study their social media and mailing lists. Participants take part in the study over six or twelve months and were interviewed at the beginning of this period as well as after six months. Participants also receive text message prompts from the researchers roughly every two weeks asking for any updates on their interactions with UC. Participants used different methods to convey information: sending messages and sometimes screenshots of their interactions and accounts. Five participants at some point phoned the researchers to explain their situation rather than text. If asked for advice, researchers pointed participants to their case managers, work coachesand a local advice charity. The exception was a participant who had significant financial troubles, and the researchers believed that the participants’ children were at serious risk. On this occasion the researchers recommended a specific financial aid the participant could apply for.We gave participants a £25 shopping voucher after their first interview and a second one for a second interview at the six-month period to reimburse them for their time. The first interviews with each participant lasted for approximately forty-five minutes and were conducted either online or in person at local charity offices,cafés or at the University of Edinburgh. Follow up interviews lasted 15-30 minutes. The four participants whose quotes are used below reviewed and consented to their quotations and the representation of their stories.Data collection for this study was not without challenges. Twoparticipants never responded to the prompts and were eventually removed from the study. Twenty-one respondents provided us with relevant data about their interactions with Universal Credit; the rest,despite replying to prompts, either did not share any information that was related to the study or did not experience any problems with US during the first six months.We refer to our participants by pseudonyms. As some of our data was based on text messages and screenshots from our participants,quotes from these data sources often contain incorrect spelling or grammar. In order to preserve the original voice of our partici-pants, we kept these as they were, unless changes were crucial for intelligibility.The results of our study cannot be interpreted without taking the limitations of this study into consideration. Firstly, as is often the case with qualitative research, our sample was not representative,so the findings are not generalizable. Secondly, the language of the interviews and data collection in general was English; therefore,our study only includes participants who were able to speak inEnglish at least on a conversational level. Thirdly, our sample has a high number of participants who identify as female, thus, the view of male and non-binary participants are less pronounced in our dataset.Researchers received ethics approval for the study from theUniversity of Edinburgh. [...] The RTI to UC data pipeline, as mentioned, entails the flow of data from claimants’ employers to HMRC, where it becomes aggregated in its Real Time Information system. Though the data is collected for tax purposes, HMRC shares this data with UC daily, and UC uses it to adjust claimants’ monthly UC payment.As is the case with many vital infrastructures when they breakdown [69], the pipeline became most visible to claimants when errors were made at some point in these data exchange processes. RTI error rates are endemic to the system. The UK’s National AuditOffice (NAO) reported in 2018 that UC is “sensitive to any change in claimants’ monthly income” and “employers sometimes supply information [to RTI] that is late or which contains errors”[54](p.61). NAO estimated that in 2017-18, UC made overpayment of 7.2 percent and underpayments of 1.3 percent in part for this reason. [54] A result of these errors are fluctuations in claimants pay, making it difficult to budget and plan.Participants’ accounts detail the steps they took to rectify the errors. In some cases, claimants contacted their employer and UCto report the error, but they then had little agency over the timing of its correction. The only data seen as relevant by UC to rectifying the pay calculation is the HMRC RTI data, not any evidence offered by the claimant.Gaja, a white Polish woman in her late 40s raising two children,experienced an RTI error during the course of the study. In her first interview in June 2022, she described her case as relatively simple,telling us, “for me personally it works great,” even though working at a charity as a case worker she had seen problems with the paycalculation affecting her clients.In October 2022 Gaja reported over a text that she had received more payment from UC than anticipated and assumed her earnings had not been reported to HMRC, resulting in larger-than-usual UCentitlement; she wrote, “Something was not reported to [HMRC]and I told them [UC] that my award is too high, but, they can’t do anything about it, need to wait for hmrc information.”Gaja was not worried about budgeting but understood such mistakes could pose problems for others:I’ve got far too much money that I need to return [toUC], not really changing anything if you are aware of the mistake, this could be a different story if I wouldn't understand how they work and spend all the money.She pursued the matter with UC, then told us in early November,“they [UC] are still waiting for my employer to send the report sofar no news.” By late November she was still waiting for an update on the case.When we interviewed Gaja a second time in January, she told us that HMRC had finally reported the September earnings two months later in December, and the overpayment from UC wouldnow be deducted automatically from her future UC payments. Heremployer told GaJa they had reported the earnings on time, so she never received an explanation for the delay and assumed that the mistake was due to her holding two jobs, and that HMRC had notregistered the wages for one. Gaja shared that she did not feel she could affect or speed up the process:I’ve informed universal credit that this will be a mis-take in payment. But they didn’t ask me about my wage slip or anything like that, they just said that it will clear up when they clear up because they need to listen to HMRC and not what I’m going to say.Gaja told us she was satisfied with how the situation was resolved and still much preferred UC, with its month-to-month calculations,to the older system used by Tax Credits, based on retrospective earnings data that so often led to overpayments and debt.Another participant in our study expressed more distress when she found an RTI error. Emily, who identifies as Black Caribbeanand white, is a single mother of two children in her late thirties. Sheworks as an administrator for a center that provides a safe place for children to meet parents they do not live with. In her first interview she was very unhappy with Universal Credit, highlighting that in the approximately three years she had been receiving it, she never felt supported and had received conflicting and wrong information [...] on her case from case workers and work coaches. She had also encountered difficulties reclaiming childcare costs.In mid-January 2023, Emily shared over a text that her employer made an error reporting her salary in November 2022, and as a result she received £300 less in her January payment than she was entitled to. Emily wrote, “I know the whole system [. . . ] is an absolute shambles. They are causing more hardship, it’s a horrible situation.” Emily shared screenshots of her exchange with her UC case manager after she reported the error in December. Her case manager told her that they would not be able to take action until January – UC needed to wait for confirmation from HMRC, which,in turn, needed a report from Emily’s employer. At the end ofDecember, she wrote to her case manager: “There is surely another way to rectify this so that I am not in financial crisis again. This is now adding to my mental health as I am not sleeping worrying.”(See Fig. 1)By mid-January Emily was distraught, texting us, “So I’m cur-rently waiting for that dispute to be resolved as I am once again out of pocket and struggling because of an error.”When we checked in at the end of January, Emily let us know,happily, that the error has been fixed thanks to her employer’s swift response: “My employer were very helpful and contacted HMRC atspeed and UC put the difference into my account on Friday. [. . . ]My work has been amazing, thankfully.”Despite this, Emily had experienced difficulties during this two-month period of uncertainty, writing, “Just frustrating [that] I had to get an advance on my wage from my work to survive. In addition to RTI-related errors, UC’s dynamic monthly payment presents another challenge for some working claimants. Noted previously by the Child Poverty Action Group [14] and Human RightsWatch [72], a punitive discrepancy can occur when a claimant's monthly assessment period, which reflects the amount of earnings a person receives within its time frame, is not in alignment with the period of work covered by the earnings. For most claimants,particularly those paid monthly, the UC assessment period will not pose problems. However, according to DWP’s own analysis,around 25 percent of claimants will find their benefits reduced because they are paid every two or four weeks. People who are not paid monthly but rather every two or four weeks will encounter certain assessment periods over the course of a year that captures two payments at once, one at the beginning and one at the end of the period. For instance, someone who receives their wage every four weeks will receive two sets of wages in one assessment pe-riod, roughly once every 13 months, and may receive reduced or no UC payment following this. DWP, well aware of this problem,calls these dual temporalities “different earning patterns” in their guidance on their official website. We detail what two users revealabout UC by interrogating the effects of the fixed assessment period on their payment.Fiona, a white Scottish woman, is a single mother in her late thirties with two children. She works as a cleaner for a school that pays her every four weeks. In her first interview she told us she was experiencing significant difficulties understanding the UC payment calculation and anticipating her monthly payment. At the beginning of August – six weeks after her first interview – she reported that she was trying to get information from UC, both through her online account and the phone helpline, regarding her entitlement. Fiona worried that, due to being paid every four weeks, she would not gether entitlement in an upcoming month. She wrote to us via text, “Itried phone uc to be told [to] write my worries and questions online,so i have done this yesterday and waiting on response.” Knowing Far in advance whether she would get her entitlement especially mattered as her children are “not entitled to school meals so [she would] need to make sure [her] kids have lunch money”.Throughout August, September and October we received fre-quent, instant updates from Fiona on her interactions with differentUC case workers as she tried to understand when she would not receive a UC payment. Fiona’s updates included screenshots of messages she exchanged with case managers and phone calls elab-orating her worries and confusion. (See Fig. 2)At the end of September, Fiona shared that she still had not received a definitive answer regarding the month she would not receive UC payment: “I don’t know if it will be november or decem-ber or both i don’t get paid , it’s horrible.” In October she wrote,“the system is hellish”.She finally learned she would not receive UC payment in No-vember from her UC statement that month, sent only a few days before her payment would have been put in her bank account. Shewrote over text, “I’m not getting a november pay it’s come up £0 no one told me.”Throughout, she interacted with several different case managers.In our second interview in mid-January 2023, she told us how frus-trating and impersonal these interactions were: “Even [just] the same person replying to me would be better than a half assed con-versation.” She described her experience during the previous three months, saying, “I keep emailing them and writing, ‘Good after-noon, could someone help me understand the calculation behind this madness?’.” She shared that she had borrowed money from her son to “to keep [her] head above water until [she] get[s] paid.”Conflicts between employers’ payment policies and the UC as-sessment period can happen as people start new jobs or change their working hours. Jennifer, a white Scottish woman, is a single mother of two children in her early thirties who worked 16 hours a week as a family support worker when we first interviewed her inJune 2022. Overall, Jennifer seemed content with UC, though she had once experienced a mix-up with her wage-reporting that she said had been quickly resolved.In July she left her job due to mental health difficulties. UC required her to look for 25 hours of work to qualify for the benefit,and by October she found a 16 hour-a-week contract serving school dinners. She worried this change in employment would affect UCs automated payment since her new employer had not yet paid her first wages for the month of October. In mid-October she sent a text to say she feared she would receive no UC payment the fol-lowing month: “If [my wage payment] doesn’t fall into the window that [UC] create. 21 to 21st of each month I wont receive any payment.” If she was paid for her October hours and November Hours in the same month, then her combined earnings could put her over the threshold to qualify for UC, resulting in no UC payment in November.When we interviewed Jennifer again in January, she informed us that, indeed, her employer’s late October pay had resulted ina “dip” in UC – though her November payment “wasn’t zero, no,it just wasn’t as high as what [she] thought”. She expressed her frustration with UC’s rigid assessment period and how it accounts for when you are paid according to HMRC, but not the period you actually worked I’d waited a long time for my first wage so it looks like they had paid me twice. [. . . ] They put it in the same month so it looked like I got more which is a really frustrating part of universal credit.Jennifer also partly blamed herself for her changing circumstances;she had quit the school dinner post in early December to take another job in January as a pupil support assistant – a position she was excited about and felt more qualified for – for 25 hours a week.Reflecting on her two jobs Jennifer told us, “It is partly my fault, Ihave leapt from job to job in such a short amount of time.",1103-8,the United Kingdom,

However, according to DWP’s own analysis,around 25 percent of claimants will find their benefits reduced because they are paid every two or four weeks. People who are not paid monthly but rather every two or four weeks will encounter certain assessment periods over the course of a year that captures two payments at once, one at the beginning and one at the end of the period. For instance, someone who receives their wage every four weeks will receive two sets of wages in one assessment pe-riod, roughly once every 13 months, and may receive reduced or no UC payment following this. DWP, well aware of this problem,calls these dual temporalities “different earning patterns” in their guidance on their official website. We detail what two users revealabout UC by interrogating the effects of the fixed assessment period on their payment.Fiona, a white Scottish woman, is a single mother in her late thirties with two children. She works as a cleaner for a school that pays her every four weeks. In her first interview she told us she was experiencing significant difficulties understanding the UC payment calculation and anticipating her monthly payment. At the beginning of August – six weeks after her first interview – she reported that she was trying to get information from UC, both through her online account and the phone helpline, regarding her entitlement. Fiona worried that, due to being paid every four weeks, she would not gether entitlement in an upcoming month. She wrote to us via text, “Itried phone uc to be told [to] write my worries and questions online,so i have done this yesterday and waiting on response.” Knowing Far in advance whether she would get her entitlement especially mattered as her children are “not entitled to school meals so [she would] need to make sure [her] kids have lunch money”.Throughout August, September and October we received fre-quent, instant updates from Fiona on her interactions with differentUC case workers as she tried to understand when she would not receive a UC payment. Fiona’s updates included screenshots of messages she exchanged with case managers and phone calls elab-orating her worries and confusion. (See Fig. 2)At the end of September, Fiona shared that she still had not received a definitive answer regarding the month she would not receive UC payment: “I don’t know if it will be november or decem-ber or both i don’t get paid , it’s horrible.” In October she wrote,“the system is hellish”.She finally learned she would not receive UC payment in No-vember from her UC statement that month, sent only a few days before her payment would have been put in her bank account. Shewrote over text, “I’m not getting a november pay it’s come up £0 no one told me.”Throughout, she interacted with several different case managers.In our second interview in mid-January 2023, she told us how frus-trating and impersonal these interactions were: “Even [just] the same person replying to me would be better than a half assed con-versation.” She described her experience during the previous three months, saying, “I keep emailing them and writing, ‘Good after-noon, could someone help me understand the calculation behind this madness?’.” She shared that she had borrowed money from her son to “to keep [her] head above water until [she] get[s] paid.”Conflicts between employers’ payment policies and the UC as-sessment period can happen as people start new jobs or change their working hours. Jennifer, a white Scottish woman, is a single mother of two children in her early thirties who worked 16 hours a week as a family support worker when we first interviewed her inJune 2022. Overall, Jennifer seemed content with UC, though she had once experienced a mix-up with her wage-reporting that she said had been quickly resolved.In July she left her job due to mental health difficulties. UC required her to look for 25 hours of work to qualify for the benefit,and by October she found a 16 hour-a-week contract serving school dinners. She worried this change in employment would affect UCs automated payment since her new employer had not yet paid her first wages for the month of October. In mid-October she sent a text to say she feared she would receive no UC payment the fol-lowing month: “If [my wage payment] doesn’t fall into the window that [UC] create. 21 to 21st of each month I wont receive any payment.” If she was paid for her October hours and November Hours in the same month, then her combined earnings could put her over the threshold to qualify for UC, resulting in no UC payment in November.When we interviewed Jennifer again in January, she informed us that, indeed, her employer’s late October pay had resulted ina “dip” in UC – though her November payment “wasn’t zero, no,it just wasn’t as high as what [she] thought”. She expressed her frustration with UC’s rigid assessment period and how it accounts for when you are paid according to HMRC, but not the period you actually worked I’d waited a long time for my first wage so it looks like they had paid me twice. [. . . ] They put it in the same month so it looked like I got more which is a really frustrating part of universal credit.Jennifer also partly blamed herself for her changing circumstances;she had quit the school dinner post in early December to take another job in January as a pupil support assistant – a position she was excited about and felt more qualified for – for 25 hours a week.Reflecting on her two jobs Jennifer told us, “It is partly my fault, Ihave leapt from job to job in such a short amount of time.",1103-8,Employers,
11,UCClaimants,Agent,"we draw on an ongoing, empirical study examining Universal Credit (UC), an automated social security payment used in the United Kingdom. UC uses a dynamic, means-testing payment calculation to determine the monthly amount of claim people are entitled to. In this study we use serial interviews plus phone texts as prompts for solicit-ing feedback from users. We argue that ALL provides a unique opportunity to gather information on ADMS, both over time and in situ. Capturing information over time allows for more granular accounts of dynamic trajectories. Through the personal accounts of users reacting in situ, QLR also gives researchers insight into the emotional dimensions of users’ interactions with ADMS.In the following literature review, we cover the challenges schol-ars have confronted while studying ADMS, how scholars have studied users of ADMS to overcome these challenges, and the value and drawbacks of longitudinal research. [...] Administered by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP),Universal Credit is the UK’s largest social security payment. DWPintroduced UC in 2012, and it is set to replace some of the previ-ous benefits by 2024. The DWP terms UC ‘digital-by-default’ [27] since recipients apply for and receive payments through an online account. The account also acts as the primary mode of communica-tion with DWP staff (though people unable to maintain the online account can opt to interact solely by phone). UC is a means-tested and conditional benefit; to qualify, some claimants must work or look for work for a certain number of hours per week, based on their capability to work and certain life circumstances, such as having dependents.This study focuses on an essential automated decision-making feature of UC: its dynamic payment algorithm. UC uses automation to determine the amount of money claimants receive each month,based on calculating data points collected during a prior monthly assessment period. The monthly assessment period is a personal-ized unit of time based on the day a person applied for the benefit –for instance, if a person applies on February 15th, their assessment period will be from the 15th of a given month until the 14th of the next month. Claimants’ start with a ‘minimum standard allowance based on their age and relationship status (either single or living with a partner) and other factors such as disability or number of dependents. Payments will then be adjusted negatively depending on monthly earnings and deductions. Deductions include repayments for advance claims the claimant may have been granted in the past,past overpayments from UC and third-party deductions made at the request of a creditor, including rent arrears, utility arrears, Council Tax bill arrears, child support maintenance and fines by UC.For those working, the adjustments to UC based on monthly earnings happen automatically through a data exchange with theHMRC’s (HM Revenue and Customs) Real Time Information (RTI)system. Employers report their employees’ earnings using payroll software to RTI for tax purposes, and DWP accesses this stream of data daily. A report by Human Rights Watch [72] uses the metaphor of a camera to describe how STI affects the UC monthly assessment period:If the RTI system is a camera, the assessment period functions like a timer that tells it when to take a photo.The resulting snapshot is the earnings data that Universal Credit’s algorithm uses to calculate an individ-ual’s benefit payment for that month.UC considers all income that is reported to HMRC for self-reported by the claimant to UC during each monthly assessment period,and the UC payment decreases accordingly. After the monthly assessment of earnings, most claimants in the UK receive their payment once a month. In Scotland, people can choose to receive their monthly pay in two, approximately bi-weekly instalments.One goal of UC’s month-to-month calculation, based on actual earnings, is to eliminate some of the problems claimants faced withUK’s legacy social security systems. A previous benefit, WorkingTax Credits, had based claimants’ monthly payment on an average of earnings from the past year as reported to HMRC, and this aver-age could over- or under-estimated the benefit owed if a claimant's earnings changed. The discrepancies in reported versus actual earn-ings led claimants into debt to DWP if their earnings fell and rose but their tax credit payment stayed the same. UC aims to eliminate over- or under-payments to claimants – and falling into arrears toDWP – and reduce the burden on claimants to report changes in earnings [49]. DWP publishes very little documentation about UC’s perfor-mance data, “despite the evidence that the Universal Credit team have built up a modern analytics capability where real-time data would be the expectation” [57] (p.70). Likewise, it does not publish any public domain data about its digital services, with the exception of blog and a smattering of one-off research projects [3] nor about their source code [57]. While DWP has consulted the researchers of this project and asked us for updates on our findings in the form of reports, they did not agree to formal interviews about how the system works. Conducting research that can account for the experiences of people who claim Universal Credit is particularly crucial given DWP’s lack of transparency about how they study and understand the user experience. As will be shown later through the use of screenshots, our research gained insight into the interac-tion between claimants and social security agents, a largely unseen aspect of social security.In the following sections, we demonstrate how ALL methods focused on users of ADMS can be a powerful approach to collect data about systems, such as UC, that are highly complex and pose problems of access. [...] The data presented in this paper is from an ongoing qualitative, lon-gitudinal panel study conducted as part of a larger project exploring the lived experiences of recipients of UC.Our panel study commenced in mid-2022 and is expected to run until the end of 2023; this paper reports on data collected in the first six-month period of the study from participants who were recruited in 2022. The study applies two distinct methods of qualitative data collection for each participant: 1. semi-structured interviews and2. bi-weekly prompted updates sent over phone text asking about participants' interactions with UC.We recruited twenty-six participants through local charities by participating in their in-person events and by advertising the study their social media and mailing lists. Participants take part in the study over six or twelve months and were interviewed at the beginning of this period as well as after six months. Participants also receive text message prompts from the researchers roughly every two weeks asking for any updates on their interactions with UC. Participants used different methods to convey information: sending messages and sometimes screenshots of their interactions and accounts. Five participants at some point phoned the researchers to explain their situation rather than text. If asked for advice, researchers pointed participants to their case managers, work coachesand a local advice charity. The exception was a participant who had significant financial troubles, and the researchers believed that the participants’ children were at serious risk. On this occasion the researchers recommended a specific financial aid the participant could apply for.We gave participants a £25 shopping voucher after their first interview and a second one for a second interview at the six-month period to reimburse them for their time. The first interviews with each participant lasted for approximately forty-five minutes and were conducted either online or in person at local charity offices,cafés or at the University of Edinburgh. Follow up interviews lasted 15-30 minutes. The four participants whose quotes are used below reviewed and consented to their quotations and the representation of their stories.Data collection for this study was not without challenges. Twoparticipants never responded to the prompts and were eventually removed from the study. Twenty-one respondents provided us with relevant data about their interactions with Universal Credit; the rest,despite replying to prompts, either did not share any information that was related to the study or did not experience any problems with US during the first six months.We refer to our participants by pseudonyms. As some of our data was based on text messages and screenshots from our participants,quotes from these data sources often contain incorrect spelling or grammar. In order to preserve the original voice of our partici-pants, we kept these as they were, unless changes were crucial for intelligibility.The results of our study cannot be interpreted without taking the limitations of this study into consideration. Firstly, as is often the case with qualitative research, our sample was not representative,so the findings are not generalizable. Secondly, the language of the interviews and data collection in general was English; therefore,our study only includes participants who were able to speak inEnglish at least on a conversational level. Thirdly, our sample has a high number of participants who identify as female, thus, the view of male and non-binary participants are less pronounced in our dataset.Researchers received ethics approval for the study from theUniversity of Edinburgh. [...] The RTI to UC data pipeline, as mentioned, entails the flow of data from claimants’ employers to HMRC, where it becomes aggregated in its Real Time Information system. Though the data is collected for tax purposes, HMRC shares this data with UC daily, and UC uses it to adjust claimants’ monthly UC payment.As is the case with many vital infrastructures when they breakdown [69], the pipeline became most visible to claimants when errors were made at some point in these data exchange processes. RTI error rates are endemic to the system. The UK’s National AuditOffice (NAO) reported in 2018 that UC is “sensitive to any change in claimants’ monthly income” and “employers sometimes supply information [to RTI] that is late or which contains errors”[54](p.61). NAO estimated that in 2017-18, UC made overpayment of 7.2 percent and underpayments of 1.3 percent in part for this reason. [54] A result of these errors are fluctuations in claimants pay, making it difficult to budget and plan.Participants’ accounts detail the steps they took to rectify the errors. In some cases, claimants contacted their employer and UCto report the error, but they then had little agency over the timing of its correction. The only data seen as relevant by UC to rectifying the pay calculation is the HMRC RTI data, not any evidence offered by the claimant.Gaja, a white Polish woman in her late 40s raising two children,experienced an RTI error during the course of the study. In her first interview in June 2022, she described her case as relatively simple,telling us, “for me personally it works great,” even though working at a charity as a case worker she had seen problems with the paycalculation affecting her clients.In October 2022 Gaja reported over a text that she had received more payment from UC than anticipated and assumed her earnings had not been reported to HMRC, resulting in larger-than-usual UCentitlement; she wrote, “Something was not reported to [HMRC]and I told them [UC] that my award is too high, but, they can’t do anything about it, need to wait for hmrc information.”Gaja was not worried about budgeting but understood such mistakes could pose problems for others:I’ve got far too much money that I need to return [toUC], not really changing anything if you are aware of the mistake, this could be a different story if I wouldn't understand how they work and spend all the money.She pursued the matter with UC, then told us in early November,“they [UC] are still waiting for my employer to send the report sofar no news.” By late November she was still waiting for an update on the case.When we interviewed Gaja a second time in January, she told us that HMRC had finally reported the September earnings two months later in December, and the overpayment from UC wouldnow be deducted automatically from her future UC payments. Heremployer told GaJa they had reported the earnings on time, so she never received an explanation for the delay and assumed that the mistake was due to her holding two jobs, and that HMRC had notregistered the wages for one. Gaja shared that she did not feel she could affect or speed up the process:I’ve informed universal credit that this will be a mis-take in payment. But they didn’t ask me about my wage slip or anything like that, they just said that it will clear up when they clear up because they need to listen to HMRC and not what I’m going to say.Gaja told us she was satisfied with how the situation was resolved and still much preferred UC, with its month-to-month calculations,to the older system used by Tax Credits, based on retrospective earnings data that so often led to overpayments and debt.Another participant in our study expressed more distress when she found an RTI error. Emily, who identifies as Black Caribbeanand white, is a single mother of two children in her late thirties. Sheworks as an administrator for a center that provides a safe place for children to meet parents they do not live with. In her first interview she was very unhappy with Universal Credit, highlighting that in the approximately three years she had been receiving it, she never felt supported and had received conflicting and wrong information [...] on her case from case workers and work coaches. She had also encountered difficulties reclaiming childcare costs.In mid-January 2023, Emily shared over a text that her employer made an error reporting her salary in November 2022, and as a result she received £300 less in her January payment than she was entitled to. Emily wrote, “I know the whole system [. . . ] is an absolute shambles. They are causing more hardship, it’s a horrible situation.” Emily shared screenshots of her exchange with her UC case manager after she reported the error in December. Her case manager told her that they would not be able to take action until January – UC needed to wait for confirmation from HMRC, which,in turn, needed a report from Emily’s employer. At the end ofDecember, she wrote to her case manager: “There is surely another way to rectify this so that I am not in financial crisis again. This is now adding to my mental health as I am not sleeping worrying.”(See Fig. 1)By mid-January Emily was distraught, texting us, “So I’m cur-rently waiting for that dispute to be resolved as I am once again out of pocket and struggling because of an error.”When we checked in at the end of January, Emily let us know,happily, that the error has been fixed thanks to her employer’s swift response: “My employer were very helpful and contacted HMRC atspeed and UC put the difference into my account on Friday. [. . . ]My work has been amazing, thankfully.”Despite this, Emily had experienced difficulties during this two-month period of uncertainty, writing, “Just frustrating [that] I had to get an advance on my wage from my work to survive. In addition to RTI-related errors, UC’s dynamic monthly payment presents another challenge for some working claimants. Noted previously by the Child Poverty Action Group [14] and Human RightsWatch [72], a punitive discrepancy can occur when a claimant's monthly assessment period, which reflects the amount of earnings a person receives within its time frame, is not in alignment with the period of work covered by the earnings.

People who are not paid monthly but rather every two or four weeks will encounter certain assessment periods over the course of a year that captures two payments at once, one at the beginning and one at the end of the period. For instance, someone who receives their wage every four weeks will receive two sets of wages in one assessment pe-riod, roughly once every 13 months, and may receive reduced or no UC payment following this. DWP, well aware of this problem,calls these dual temporalities “different earning patterns” in their guidance on their official website.

The only data seen as relevant by UC to rectifying the pay calculation is the HMRC RTI data, not any evidence offered by the claimant.Gaja, a white Polish woman in her late 40s raising two children,experienced an RTI error during the course of the study. In her first interview in June 2022, she described her case as relatively simple,telling us, “for me personally it works great,” even though working at a charity as a case worker she had seen problems with the paycalculation affecting her clients.In October 2022 Gaja reported over a text that she had received more payment from UC than anticipated and assumed her earnings had not been reported to HMRC, resulting in larger-than-usual UCentitlement; she wrote, “Something was not reported to [HMRC]and I told them [UC] that my award is too high, but, they can’t do anything about it, need to wait for hmrc information.”Gaja was not worried about budgeting but understood such mistakes could pose problems for others:I’ve got far too much money that I need to return [toUC], not really changing anything if you are aware of the mistake, this could be a different story if I wouldn't understand how they work and spend all the money.She pursued the matter with UC, then told us in early November,“they [UC] are still waiting for my employer to send the report sofar no news.” By late November she was still waiting for an update on the case.When we interviewed Gaja a second time in January, she told us that HMRC had finally reported the September earnings two months later in December, and the overpayment from UC wouldnow be deducted automatically from her future UC payments. Heremployer told GaJa they had reported the earnings on time, so she never received an explanation for the delay and assumed that the mistake was due to her holding two jobs, and that HMRC had notregistered the wages for one. Gaja shared that she did not feel she could affect or speed up the process:I’ve informed universal credit that this will be a mis-take in payment. But they didn’t ask me about my wage slip or anything like that, they just said that it will clear up when they clear up because they need to listen to HMRC and not what I’m going to say.Gaja told us she was satisfied with how the situation was resolved and still much preferred UC, with its month-to-month calculations,to the older system used by Tax Credits, based on retrospective earnings data that so often led to overpayments and debt.Another participant in our study expressed more distress when she found an RTI error. Emily, who identifies as Black Caribbeanand white, is a single mother of two children in her late thirties. Sheworks as an administrator for a center that provides a safe place for children to meet parents they do not live with. In her first interview she was very unhappy with Universal Credit, highlighting that in the approximately three years she had been receiving it, she never felt supported and had received conflicting and wrong information [...] on her case from case workers and work coaches. She had also encountered difficulties reclaiming childcare costs.In mid-January 2023, Emily shared over a text that her employer made an error reporting her salary in November 2022, and as a result she received £300 less in her January payment than she was entitled to. Emily wrote, “I know the whole system [. . . ] is an absolute shambles. They are causing more hardship, it’s a horrible situation.” Emily shared screenshots of her exchange with her UC case manager after she reported the error in December. Her case manager told her that they would not be able to take action until January – UC needed to wait for confirmation from HMRC, which,in turn, needed a report from Emily’s employer. At the end ofDecember, she wrote to her case manager: “There is surely another way to rectify this so that I am not in financial crisis again. This is now adding to my mental health as I am not sleeping worrying.”(See Fig. 1)By mid-January Emily was distraught, texting us, “So I’m cur-rently waiting for that dispute to be resolved as I am once again out of pocket and struggling because of an error.”When we checked in at the end of January, Emily let us know,happily, that the error has been fixed thanks to her employer’s swift response: “My employer were very helpful and contacted HMRC atspeed and UC put the difference into my account on Friday. [. . . ]My work has been amazing, thankfully.”Despite this, Emily had experienced difficulties during this two-month period of uncertainty, writing, “Just frustrating [that] I had to get an advance on my wage from my work to survive. In addition to RTI-related errors, UC’s dynamic monthly payment presents another challenge for some working claimants. Noted previously by the Child Poverty Action Group [14] and Human RightsWatch [72], a punitive discrepancy can occur when a claimant's monthly assessment period, which reflects the amount of earnings a person receives within its time frame, is not in alignment with the period of work covered by the earnings. For most claimants,particularly those paid monthly, the UC assessment period will not pose problems. However, according to DWP’s own analysis,around 25 percent of claimants will find their benefits reduced because they are paid every two or four weeks. People who are not paid monthly but rather every two or four weeks will encounter certain assessment periods over the course of a year that captures two payments at once, one at the beginning and one at the end of the period. For instance, someone who receives their wage every four weeks will receive two sets of wages in one assessment pe-riod, roughly once every 13 months, and may receive reduced or no UC payment following this. DWP, well aware of this problem,calls these dual temporalities “different earning patterns” in their guidance on their official website. We detail what two users revealabout UC by interrogating the effects of the fixed assessment period on their payment.Fiona, a white Scottish woman, is a single mother in her late thirties with two children. She works as a cleaner for a school that pays her every four weeks. In her first interview she told us she was experiencing significant difficulties understanding the UC payment calculation and anticipating her monthly payment. At the beginning of August – six weeks after her first interview – she reported that she was trying to get information from UC, both through her online account and the phone helpline, regarding her entitlement. Fiona worried that, due to being paid every four weeks, she would not gether entitlement in an upcoming month. She wrote to us via text, “Itried phone uc to be told [to] write my worries and questions online,so i have done this yesterday and waiting on response.” Knowing Far in advance whether she would get her entitlement especially mattered as her children are “not entitled to school meals so [she would] need to make sure [her] kids have lunch money”.Throughout August, September and October we received fre-quent, instant updates from Fiona on her interactions with differentUC case workers as she tried to understand when she would not receive a UC payment. Fiona’s updates included screenshots of messages she exchanged with case managers and phone calls elab-orating her worries and confusion. (See Fig. 2)At the end of September, Fiona shared that she still had not received a definitive answer regarding the month she would not receive UC payment: “I don’t know if it will be november or decem-ber or both i don’t get paid , it’s horrible.” In October she wrote,“the system is hellish”.She finally learned she would not receive UC payment in No-vember from her UC statement that month, sent only a few days before her payment would have been put in her bank account. Shewrote over text, “I’m not getting a november pay it’s come up £0 no one told me.”Throughout, she interacted with several different case managers.In our second interview in mid-January 2023, she told us how frus-trating and impersonal these interactions were: “Even [just] the same person replying to me would be better than a half assed con-versation.” She described her experience during the previous three months, saying, “I keep emailing them and writing, ‘Good after-noon, could someone help me understand the calculation behind this madness?’.” She shared that she had borrowed money from her son to “to keep [her] head above water until [she] get[s] paid.”Conflicts between employers’ payment policies and the UC as-sessment period can happen as people start new jobs or change their working hours. Jennifer, a white Scottish woman, is a single mother of two children in her early thirties who worked 16 hours a week as a family support worker when we first interviewed her inJune 2022. Overall, Jennifer seemed content with UC, though she had once experienced a mix-up with her wage-reporting that she said had been quickly resolved.In July she left her job due to mental health difficulties. UC required her to look for 25 hours of work to qualify for the benefit,and by October she found a 16 hour-a-week contract serving school dinners. She worried this change in employment would affect UCs automated payment since her new employer had not yet paid her first wages for the month of October. In mid-October she sent a text to say she feared she would receive no UC payment the fol-lowing month: “If [my wage payment] doesn’t fall into the window that [UC] create. 21 to 21st of each month I wont receive any payment.” If she was paid for her October hours and November Hours in the same month, then her combined earnings could put her over the threshold to qualify for UC, resulting in no UC payment in November.When we interviewed Jennifer again in January, she informed us that, indeed, her employer’s late October pay had resulted ina “dip” in UC – though her November payment “wasn’t zero, no,it just wasn’t as high as what [she] thought”. She expressed her frustration with UC’s rigid assessment period and how it accounts for when you are paid according to HMRC, but not the period you actually worked I’d waited a long time for my first wage so it looks like they had paid me twice. [. . . ] They put it in the same month so it looked like I got more which is a really frustrating part of universal credit.Jennifer also partly blamed herself for her changing circumstances;she had quit the school dinner post in early December to take another job in January as a pupil support assistant – a position she was excited about and felt more qualified for – for 25 hours a week.Reflecting on her two jobs Jennifer told us, “It is partly my fault, Ihave leapt from job to job in such a short amount of time.",1103-8,RTI error rates,
13,LackOfSupport,Perceived_Problem,"we draw on an ongoing, empirical study examining Universal Credit (UC), an automated social security payment used in the United Kingdom. UC uses a dynamic, means-testing payment calculation to determine the monthly amount of claim people are entitled to. In this study we use serial interviews plus phone texts as prompts for solicit-ing feedback from users. We argue that ALL provides a unique opportunity to gather information on ADMS, both over time and in situ. Capturing information over time allows for more granular accounts of dynamic trajectories. Through the personal accounts of users reacting in situ, QLR also gives researchers insight into the emotional dimensions of users’ interactions with ADMS.In the following literature review, we cover the challenges schol-ars have confronted while studying ADMS, how scholars have studied users of ADMS to overcome these challenges, and the value and drawbacks of longitudinal research. [...] Administered by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP),Universal Credit is the UK’s largest social security payment. DWPintroduced UC in 2012, and it is set to replace some of the previ-ous benefits by 2024. The DWP terms UC ‘digital-by-default’ [27] since recipients apply for and receive payments through an online account. The account also acts as the primary mode of communica-tion with DWP staff (though people unable to maintain the online account can opt to interact solely by phone). UC is a means-tested and conditional benefit; to qualify, some claimants must work or look for work for a certain number of hours per week, based on their capability to work and certain life circumstances, such as having dependents.This study focuses on an essential automated decision-making feature of UC: its dynamic payment algorithm. UC uses automation to determine the amount of money claimants receive each month,based on calculating data points collected during a prior monthly assessment period. The monthly assessment period is a personal-ized unit of time based on the day a person applied for the benefit –for instance, if a person applies on February 15th, their assessment period will be from the 15th of a given month until the 14th of the next month. Claimants’ start with a ‘minimum standard allowance based on their age and relationship status (either single or living with a partner) and other factors such as disability or number of dependents. Payments will then be adjusted negatively depending on monthly earnings and deductions. Deductions include repayments for advance claims the claimant may have been granted in the past,past overpayments from UC and third-party deductions made at the request of a creditor, including rent arrears, utility arrears, Council Tax bill arrears, child support maintenance and fines by UC.For those working, the adjustments to UC based on monthly earnings happen automatically through a data exchange with theHMRC’s (HM Revenue and Customs) Real Time Information (RTI)system. Employers report their employees’ earnings using payroll software to RTI for tax purposes, and DWP accesses this stream of data daily. A report by Human Rights Watch [72] uses the metaphor of a camera to describe how STI affects the UC monthly assessment period:If the RTI system is a camera, the assessment period functions like a timer that tells it when to take a photo.The resulting snapshot is the earnings data that Universal Credit’s algorithm uses to calculate an individ-ual’s benefit payment for that month.UC considers all income that is reported to HMRC for self-reported by the claimant to UC during each monthly assessment period,and the UC payment decreases accordingly. After the monthly assessment of earnings, most claimants in the UK receive their payment once a month. In Scotland, people can choose to receive their monthly pay in two, approximately bi-weekly instalments.One goal of UC’s month-to-month calculation, based on actual earnings, is to eliminate some of the problems claimants faced withUK’s legacy social security systems. A previous benefit, WorkingTax Credits, had based claimants’ monthly payment on an average of earnings from the past year as reported to HMRC, and this aver-age could over- or under-estimated the benefit owed if a claimant's earnings changed. The discrepancies in reported versus actual earn-ings led claimants into debt to DWP if their earnings fell and rose but their tax credit payment stayed the same. UC aims to eliminate over- or under-payments to claimants – and falling into arrears toDWP – and reduce the burden on claimants to report changes in earnings [49]. DWP publishes very little documentation about UC’s perfor-mance data, “despite the evidence that the Universal Credit team have built up a modern analytics capability where real-time data would be the expectation” [57] (p.70). Likewise, it does not publish any public domain data about its digital services, with the exception of blog and a smattering of one-off research projects [3] nor about their source code [57]. While DWP has consulted the researchers of this project and asked us for updates on our findings in the form of reports, they did not agree to formal interviews about how the system works. Conducting research that can account for the experiences of people who claim Universal Credit is particularly crucial given DWP’s lack of transparency about how they study and understand the user experience. As will be shown later through the use of screenshots, our research gained insight into the interac-tion between claimants and social security agents, a largely unseen aspect of social security.In the following sections, we demonstrate how ALL methods focused on users of ADMS can be a powerful approach to collect data about systems, such as UC, that are highly complex and pose problems of access. [...] The data presented in this paper is from an ongoing qualitative, lon-gitudinal panel study conducted as part of a larger project exploring the lived experiences of recipients of UC.Our panel study commenced in mid-2022 and is expected to run until the end of 2023; this paper reports on data collected in the first six-month period of the study from participants who were recruited in 2022. The study applies two distinct methods of qualitative data collection for each participant: 1. semi-structured interviews and2. bi-weekly prompted updates sent over phone text asking about participants' interactions with UC.We recruited twenty-six participants through local charities by participating in their in-person events and by advertising the study their social media and mailing lists. Participants take part in the study over six or twelve months and were interviewed at the beginning of this period as well as after six months. Participants also receive text message prompts from the researchers roughly every two weeks asking for any updates on their interactions with UC. Participants used different methods to convey information: sending messages and sometimes screenshots of their interactions and accounts. Five participants at some point phoned the researchers to explain their situation rather than text. If asked for advice, researchers pointed participants to their case managers, work coachesand a local advice charity. The exception was a participant who had significant financial troubles, and the researchers believed that the participants’ children were at serious risk. On this occasion the researchers recommended a specific financial aid the participant could apply for.We gave participants a £25 shopping voucher after their first interview and a second one for a second interview at the six-month period to reimburse them for their time. The first interviews with each participant lasted for approximately forty-five minutes and were conducted either online or in person at local charity offices,cafés or at the University of Edinburgh. Follow up interviews lasted 15-30 minutes. The four participants whose quotes are used below reviewed and consented to their quotations and the representation of their stories.Data collection for this study was not without challenges. Twoparticipants never responded to the prompts and were eventually removed from the study. Twenty-one respondents provided us with relevant data about their interactions with Universal Credit; the rest,despite replying to prompts, either did not share any information that was related to the study or did not experience any problems with US during the first six months.We refer to our participants by pseudonyms. As some of our data was based on text messages and screenshots from our participants,quotes from these data sources often contain incorrect spelling or grammar. In order to preserve the original voice of our partici-pants, we kept these as they were, unless changes were crucial for intelligibility.The results of our study cannot be interpreted without taking the limitations of this study into consideration. Firstly, as is often the case with qualitative research, our sample was not representative,so the findings are not generalizable. Secondly, the language of the interviews and data collection in general was English; therefore,our study only includes participants who were able to speak inEnglish at least on a conversational level. Thirdly, our sample has a high number of participants who identify as female, thus, the view of male and non-binary participants are less pronounced in our dataset.Researchers received ethics approval for the study from theUniversity of Edinburgh. [...] The RTI to UC data pipeline, as mentioned, entails the flow of data from claimants’ employers to HMRC, where it becomes aggregated in its Real Time Information system. Though the data is collected for tax purposes, HMRC shares this data with UC daily, and UC uses it to adjust claimants’ monthly UC payment.As is the case with many vital infrastructures when they breakdown [69], the pipeline became most visible to claimants when errors were made at some point in these data exchange processes. RTI error rates are endemic to the system. The UK’s National AuditOffice (NAO) reported in 2018 that UC is “sensitive to any change in claimants’ monthly income” and “employers sometimes supply information [to RTI] that is late or which contains errors”[54](p.61). NAO estimated that in 2017-18, UC made overpayment of 7.2 percent and underpayments of 1.3 percent in part for this reason. [54] A result of these errors are fluctuations in claimants pay, making it difficult to budget and plan.Participants’ accounts detail the steps they took to rectify the errors. In some cases, claimants contacted their employer and UCto report the error, but they then had little agency over the timing of its correction. The only data seen as relevant by UC to rectifying the pay calculation is the HMRC RTI data, not any evidence offered by the claimant.Gaja, a white Polish woman in her late 40s raising two children,experienced an RTI error during the course of the study. In her first interview in June 2022, she described her case as relatively simple,telling us, “for me personally it works great,” even though working at a charity as a case worker she had seen problems with the paycalculation affecting her clients.In October 2022 Gaja reported over a text that she had received more payment from UC than anticipated and assumed her earnings had not been reported to HMRC, resulting in larger-than-usual UCentitlement; she wrote, “Something was not reported to [HMRC]and I told them [UC] that my award is too high, but, they can’t do anything about it, need to wait for hmrc information.”Gaja was not worried about budgeting but understood such mistakes could pose problems for others:I’ve got far too much money that I need to return [toUC], not really changing anything if you are aware of the mistake, this could be a different story if I wouldn't understand how they work and spend all the money.She pursued the matter with UC, then told us in early November,“they [UC] are still waiting for my employer to send the report sofar no news.” By late November she was still waiting for an update on the case.When we interviewed Gaja a second time in January, she told us that HMRC had finally reported the September earnings two months later in December, and the overpayment from UC wouldnow be deducted automatically from her future UC payments.

While DWP has consulted the researchers of this project and asked us for updates on our findings in the form of reports, they did not agree to formal interviews about how the system works. Conducting research that can account for the experiences of people who claim Universal Credit is particularly crucial given DWP’s lack of transparency about how they study and understand the user experience. As will be shown later through the use of screenshots, our research gained insight into the interac-tion between claimants and social security agents, a largely unseen aspect of social security.In the following sections, we demonstrate how ALL methods focused on users of ADMS can be a powerful approach to collect data about systems, such as UC, that are highly complex and pose problems of access. [...] The data presented in this paper is from an ongoing qualitative, lon-gitudinal panel study conducted as part of a larger project exploring the lived experiences of recipients of UC.Our panel study commenced in mid-2022 and is expected to run until the end of 2023; this paper reports on data collected in the first six-month period of the study from participants who were recruited in 2022. The study applies two distinct methods of qualitative data collection for each participant: 1. semi-structured interviews and2. bi-weekly prompted updates sent over phone text asking about participants' interactions with UC.We recruited twenty-six participants through local charities by participating in their in-person events and by advertising the study their social media and mailing lists. Participants take part in the study over six or twelve months and were interviewed at the beginning of this period as well as after six months. Participants also receive text message prompts from the researchers roughly every two weeks asking for any updates on their interactions with UC. Participants used different methods to convey information: sending messages and sometimes screenshots of their interactions and accounts. Five participants at some point phoned the researchers to explain their situation rather than text. If asked for advice, researchers pointed participants to their case managers, work coachesand a local advice charity. The exception was a participant who had significant financial troubles, and the researchers believed that the participants’ children were at serious risk. On this occasion the researchers recommended a specific financial aid the participant could apply for.We gave participants a £25 shopping voucher after their first interview and a second one for a second interview at the six-month period to reimburse them for their time. The first interviews with each participant lasted for approximately forty-five minutes and were conducted either online or in person at local charity offices,cafés or at the University of Edinburgh. Follow up interviews lasted 15-30 minutes. The four participants whose quotes are used below reviewed and consented to their quotations and the representation of their stories.Data collection for this study was not without challenges. Twoparticipants never responded to the prompts and were eventually removed from the study. Twenty-one respondents provided us with relevant data about their interactions with Universal Credit; the rest,despite replying to prompts, either did not share any information that was related to the study or did not experience any problems with US during the first six months.We refer to our participants by pseudonyms. As some of our data was based on text messages and screenshots from our participants,quotes from these data sources often contain incorrect spelling or grammar. In order to preserve the original voice of our partici-pants, we kept these as they were, unless changes were crucial for intelligibility.The results of our study cannot be interpreted without taking the limitations of this study into consideration. Firstly, as is often the case with qualitative research, our sample was not representative,so the findings are not generalizable. Secondly, the language of the interviews and data collection in general was English; therefore,our study only includes participants who were able to speak inEnglish at least on a conversational level. Thirdly, our sample has a high number of participants who identify as female, thus, the view of male and non-binary participants are less pronounced in our dataset.Researchers received ethics approval for the study from theUniversity of Edinburgh. [...] The RTI to UC data pipeline, as mentioned, entails the flow of data from claimants’ employers to HMRC, where it becomes aggregated in its Real Time Information system. Though the data is collected for tax purposes, HMRC shares this data with UC daily, and UC uses it to adjust claimants’ monthly UC payment.As is the case with many vital infrastructures when they breakdown [69], the pipeline became most visible to claimants when errors were made at some point in these data exchange processes. RTI error rates are endemic to the system. The UK’s National AuditOffice (NAO) reported in 2018 that UC is “sensitive to any change in claimants’ monthly income” and “employers sometimes supply information [to RTI] that is late or which contains errors”[54](p.61). NAO estimated that in 2017-18, UC made overpayment of 7.2 percent and underpayments of 1.3 percent in part for this reason. [54] A result of these errors are fluctuations in claimants pay, making it difficult to budget and plan.Participants’ accounts detail the steps they took to rectify the errors. In some cases, claimants contacted their employer and UCto report the error, but they then had little agency over the timing of its correction. The only data seen as relevant by UC to rectifying the pay calculation is the HMRC RTI data, not any evidence offered by the claimant.Gaja, a white Polish woman in her late 40s raising two children,experienced an RTI error during the course of the study. In her first interview in June 2022, she described her case as relatively simple,telling us, “for me personally it works great,” even though working at a charity as a case worker she had seen problems with the paycalculation affecting her clients.In October 2022 Gaja reported over a text that she had received more payment from UC than anticipated and assumed her earnings had not been reported to HMRC, resulting in larger-than-usual UCentitlement; she wrote, “Something was not reported to [HMRC]and I told them [UC] that my award is too high, but, they can’t do anything about it, need to wait for hmrc information.”Gaja was not worried about budgeting but understood such mistakes could pose problems for others:I’ve got far too much money that I need to return [toUC], not really changing anything if you are aware of the mistake, this could be a different story if I wouldn't understand how they work and spend all the money.She pursued the matter with UC, then told us in early November,“they [UC] are still waiting for my employer to send the report sofar no news.” By late November she was still waiting for an update on the case.When we interviewed Gaja a second time in January, she told us that HMRC had finally reported the September earnings two months later in December, and the overpayment from UC wouldnow be deducted automatically from her future UC payments. Heremployer told GaJa they had reported the earnings on time, so she never received an explanation for the delay and assumed that the mistake was due to her holding two jobs, and that HMRC had notregistered the wages for one. Gaja shared that she did not feel she could affect or speed up the process:I’ve informed universal credit that this will be a mis-take in payment. But they didn’t ask me about my wage slip or anything like that, they just said that it will clear up when they clear up because they need to listen to HMRC and not what I’m going to say.Gaja told us she was satisfied with how the situation was resolved and still much preferred UC, with its month-to-month calculations,to the older system used by Tax Credits, based on retrospective earnings data that so often led to overpayments and debt.Another participant in our study expressed more distress when she found an RTI error. Emily, who identifies as Black Caribbeanand white, is a single mother of two children in her late thirties. Sheworks as an administrator for a center that provides a safe place for children to meet parents they do not live with. In her first interview she was very unhappy with Universal Credit, highlighting that in the approximately three years she had been receiving it, she never felt supported and had received conflicting and wrong information [...] on her case from case workers and work coaches. She had also encountered difficulties reclaiming childcare costs.In mid-January 2023, Emily shared over a text that her employer made an error reporting her salary in November 2022, and as a result she received £300 less in her January payment than she was entitled to. Emily wrote, “I know the whole system [. . . ] is an absolute shambles. They are causing more hardship, it’s a horrible situation.” Emily shared screenshots of her exchange with her UC case manager after she reported the error in December. Her case manager told her that they would not be able to take action until January – UC needed to wait for confirmation from HMRC, which,in turn, needed a report from Emily’s employer. At the end ofDecember, she wrote to her case manager: “There is surely another way to rectify this so that I am not in financial crisis again. This is now adding to my mental health as I am not sleeping worrying.”(See Fig. 1)By mid-January Emily was distraught, texting us, “So I’m cur-rently waiting for that dispute to be resolved as I am once again out of pocket and struggling because of an error.”When we checked in at the end of January, Emily let us know,happily, that the error has been fixed thanks to her employer’s swift response: “My employer were very helpful and contacted HMRC atspeed and UC put the difference into my account on Friday. [. . . ]My work has been amazing, thankfully.”Despite this, Emily had experienced difficulties during this two-month period of uncertainty, writing, “Just frustrating [that] I had to get an advance on my wage from my work to survive. In addition to RTI-related errors, UC’s dynamic monthly payment presents another challenge for some working claimants. Noted previously by the Child Poverty Action Group [14] and Human RightsWatch [72], a punitive discrepancy can occur when a claimant's monthly assessment period, which reflects the amount of earnings a person receives within its time frame, is not in alignment with the period of work covered by the earnings. For most claimants,particularly those paid monthly, the UC assessment period will not pose problems. However, according to DWP’s own analysis,around 25 percent of claimants will find their benefits reduced because they are paid every two or four weeks. People who are not paid monthly but rather every two or four weeks will encounter certain assessment periods over the course of a year that captures two payments at once, one at the beginning and one at the end of the period. For instance, someone who receives their wage every four weeks will receive two sets of wages in one assessment pe-riod, roughly once every 13 months, and may receive reduced or no UC payment following this. DWP, well aware of this problem,calls these dual temporalities “different earning patterns” in their guidance on their official website. We detail what two users revealabout UC by interrogating the effects of the fixed assessment period on their payment.Fiona, a white Scottish woman, is a single mother in her late thirties with two children. She works as a cleaner for a school that pays her every four weeks. In her first interview she told us she was experiencing significant difficulties understanding the UC payment calculation and anticipating her monthly payment. At the beginning of August – six weeks after her first interview – she reported that she was trying to get information from UC, both through her online account and the phone helpline, regarding her entitlement. Fiona worried that, due to being paid every four weeks, she would not gether entitlement in an upcoming month. She wrote to us via text, “Itried phone uc to be told [to] write my worries and questions online,so i have done this yesterday and waiting on response.” Knowing Far in advance whether she would get her entitlement especially mattered as her children are “not entitled to school meals so [she would] need to make sure [her] kids have lunch money”.Throughout August, September and October we received fre-quent, instant updates from Fiona on her interactions with differentUC case workers as she tried to understand when she would not receive a UC payment. Fiona’s updates included screenshots of messages she exchanged with case managers and phone calls elab-orating her worries and confusion. (See Fig. 2)At the end of September, Fiona shared that she still had not received a definitive answer regarding the month she would not receive UC payment: “I don’t know if it will be november or decem-ber or both i don’t get paid , it’s horrible.” In October she wrote,“the system is hellish”.She finally learned she would not receive UC payment in No-vember from her UC statement that month, sent only a few days before her payment would have been put in her bank account. Shewrote over text, “I’m not getting a november pay it’s come up £0 no one told me.”Throughout, she interacted with several different case managers.In our second interview in mid-January 2023, she told us how frus-trating and impersonal these interactions were: “Even [just] the same person replying to me would be better than a half assed con-versation.” She described her experience during the previous three months, saying, “I keep emailing them and writing, ‘Good after-noon, could someone help me understand the calculation behind this madness?’.” She shared that she had borrowed money from her son to “to keep [her] head above water until [she] get[s] paid.”Conflicts between employers’ payment policies and the UC as-sessment period can happen as people start new jobs or change their working hours. Jennifer, a white Scottish woman, is a single mother of two children in her early thirties who worked 16 hours a week as a family support worker when we first interviewed her inJune 2022. Overall, Jennifer seemed content with UC, though she had once experienced a mix-up with her wage-reporting that she said had been quickly resolved.In July she left her job due to mental health difficulties. UC required her to look for 25 hours of work to qualify for the benefit,and by October she found a 16 hour-a-week contract serving school dinners. She worried this change in employment would affect UCs automated payment since her new employer had not yet paid her first wages for the month of October. In mid-October she sent a text to say she feared she would receive no UC payment the fol-lowing month: “If [my wage payment] doesn’t fall into the window that [UC] create. 21 to 21st of each month I wont receive any payment.” If she was paid for her October hours and November Hours in the same month, then her combined earnings could put her over the threshold to qualify for UC, resulting in no UC payment in November.When we interviewed Jennifer again in January, she informed us that, indeed, her employer’s late October pay had resulted ina “dip” in UC – though her November payment “wasn’t zero, no,it just wasn’t as high as what [she] thought”. She expressed her frustration with UC’s rigid assessment period and how it accounts for when you are paid according to HMRC, but not the period you actually worked I’d waited a long time for my first wage so it looks like they had paid me twice. [. . . ] They put it in the same month so it looked like I got more which is a really frustrating part of universal credit.Jennifer also partly blamed herself for her changing circumstances;she had quit the school dinner post in early December to take another job in January as a pupil support assistant – a position she was excited about and felt more qualified for – for 25 hours a week.Reflecting on her two jobs Jennifer told us, “It is partly my fault, Ihave leapt from job to job in such a short amount of time.",1103-8,"Universal Credit (UC), an automated social security payment ",
15,ReductionDueToScheduling,Perceived_Problem,"we draw on an ongoing, empirical study examining Universal Credit (UC), an automated social security payment used in the United Kingdom. UC uses a dynamic, means-testing payment calculation to determine the monthly amount of claim people are entitled to. In this study we use serial interviews plus phone texts as prompts for solicit-ing feedback from users. We argue that ALL provides a unique opportunity to gather information on ADMS, both over time and in situ. Capturing information over time allows for more granular accounts of dynamic trajectories. Through the personal accounts of users reacting in situ, QLR also gives researchers insight into the emotional dimensions of users’ interactions with ADMS.In the following literature review, we cover the challenges schol-ars have confronted while studying ADMS, how scholars have studied users of ADMS to overcome these challenges, and the value and drawbacks of longitudinal research. [...] Administered by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP),Universal Credit is the UK’s largest social security payment. DWPintroduced UC in 2012, and it is set to replace some of the previ-ous benefits by 2024. The DWP terms UC ‘digital-by-default’ [27] since recipients apply for and receive payments through an online account. The account also acts as the primary mode of communica-tion with DWP staff (though people unable to maintain the online account can opt to interact solely by phone). UC is a means-tested and conditional benefit; to qualify, some claimants must work or look for work for a certain number of hours per week, based on their capability to work and certain life circumstances, such as having dependents.This study focuses on an essential automated decision-making feature of UC: its dynamic payment algorithm. UC uses automation to determine the amount of money claimants receive each month,based on calculating data points collected during a prior monthly assessment period. The monthly assessment period is a personal-ized unit of time based on the day a person applied for the benefit –for instance, if a person applies on February 15th, their assessment period will be from the 15th of a given month until the 14th of the next month. Claimants’ start with a ‘minimum standard allowance based on their age and relationship status (either single or living with a partner) and other factors such as disability or number of dependents. Payments will then be adjusted negatively depending on monthly earnings and deductions. Deductions include repayments for advance claims the claimant may have been granted in the past,past overpayments from UC and third-party deductions made at the request of a creditor, including rent arrears, utility arrears, Council Tax bill arrears, child support maintenance and fines by UC.For those working, the adjustments to UC based on monthly earnings happen automatically through a data exchange with theHMRC’s (HM Revenue and Customs) Real Time Information (RTI)system. Employers report their employees’ earnings using payroll software to RTI for tax purposes, and DWP accesses this stream of data daily. A report by Human Rights Watch [72] uses the metaphor of a camera to describe how STI affects the UC monthly assessment period:If the RTI system is a camera, the assessment period functions like a timer that tells it when to take a photo.The resulting snapshot is the earnings data that Universal Credit’s algorithm uses to calculate an individ-ual’s benefit payment for that month.UC considers all income that is reported to HMRC for self-reported by the claimant to UC during each monthly assessment period,and the UC payment decreases accordingly. After the monthly assessment of earnings, most claimants in the UK receive their payment once a month. In Scotland, people can choose to receive their monthly pay in two, approximately bi-weekly instalments.One goal of UC’s month-to-month calculation, based on actual earnings, is to eliminate some of the problems claimants faced withUK’s legacy social security systems. A previous benefit, WorkingTax Credits, had based claimants’ monthly payment on an average of earnings from the past year as reported to HMRC, and this aver-age could over- or under-estimated the benefit owed if a claimant's earnings changed. The discrepancies in reported versus actual earn-ings led claimants into debt to DWP if their earnings fell and rose but their tax credit payment stayed the same. UC aims to eliminate over- or under-payments to claimants – and falling into arrears toDWP – and reduce the burden on claimants to report changes in earnings [49]. DWP publishes very little documentation about UC’s perfor-mance data, “despite the evidence that the Universal Credit team have built up a modern analytics capability where real-time data would be the expectation” [57] (p.70). Likewise, it does not publish any public domain data about its digital services, with the exception of blog and a smattering of one-off research projects [3] nor about their source code [57]. While DWP has consulted the researchers of this project and asked us for updates on our findings in the form of reports, they did not agree to formal interviews about how the system works. Conducting research that can account for the experiences of people who claim Universal Credit is particularly crucial given DWP’s lack of transparency about how they study and understand the user experience.

[. . . ] They put it in the same month so it looked like I got more which is a really frustrating part of universal credit.Jennifer also partly blamed herself for her changing circumstances;she had quit the school dinner post in early December to take another job in January as a pupil support assistant – a position she was excited about and felt more qualified for – for 25 hours a week.Reflecting on her two jobs Jennifer told us, “It is partly my fault, Ihave leapt from job to job in such a short amount of time.",1103-8,find their benefits reduced because they are paid every two or four weeks.,
16,Frustration,Perceived_Problem,"we draw on an ongoing, empirical study examining Universal Credit (UC), an automated social security payment used in the United Kingdom. UC uses a dynamic, means-testing payment calculation to determine the monthly amount of claim people are entitled to. In this study we use serial interviews plus phone texts as prompts for solicit-ing feedback from users. We argue that ALL provides a unique opportunity to gather information on ADMS, both over time and in situ. Capturing information over time allows for more granular accounts of dynamic trajectories. Through the personal accounts of users reacting in situ, QLR also gives researchers insight into the emotional dimensions of users’ interactions with ADMS.In the following literature review, we cover the challenges schol-ars have confronted while studying ADMS, how scholars have studied users of ADMS to overcome these challenges, and the value and drawbacks of longitudinal research. [...] Administered by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP),Universal Credit is the UK’s largest social security payment. DWPintroduced UC in 2012, and it is set to replace some of the previ-ous benefits by 2024. The DWP terms UC ‘digital-by-default’ [27] since recipients apply for and receive payments through an online account. The account also acts as the primary mode of communica-tion with DWP staff (though people unable to maintain the online account can opt to interact solely by phone). UC is a means-tested and conditional benefit; to qualify, some claimants must work or look for work for a certain number of hours per week, based on their capability to work and certain life circumstances, such as having dependents.This study focuses on an essential automated decision-making feature of UC: its dynamic payment algorithm. UC uses automation to determine the amount of money claimants receive each month,based on calculating data points collected during a prior monthly assessment period. The monthly assessment period is a personal-ized unit of time based on the day a person applied for the benefit –for instance, if a person applies on February 15th, their assessment period will be from the 15th of a given month until the 14th of the next month. Claimants’ start with a ‘minimum standard allowance based on their age and relationship status (either single or living with a partner) and other factors such as disability or number of dependents. Payments will then be adjusted negatively depending on monthly earnings and deductions. Deductions include repayments for advance claims the claimant may have been granted in the past,past overpayments from UC and third-party deductions made at the request of a creditor, including rent arrears, utility arrears, Council Tax bill arrears, child support maintenance and fines by UC.For those working, the adjustments to UC based on monthly earnings happen automatically through a data exchange with theHMRC’s (HM Revenue and Customs) Real Time Information (RTI)system. Employers report their employees’ earnings using payroll software to RTI for tax purposes, and DWP accesses this stream of data daily. A report by Human Rights Watch [72] uses the metaphor of a camera to describe how STI affects the UC monthly assessment period:If the RTI system is a camera, the assessment period functions like a timer that tells it when to take a photo.The resulting snapshot is the earnings data that Universal Credit’s algorithm uses to calculate an individ-ual’s benefit payment for that month.UC considers all income that is reported to HMRC for self-reported by the claimant to UC during each monthly assessment period,and the UC payment decreases accordingly. After the monthly assessment of earnings, most claimants in the UK receive their payment once a month. In Scotland, people can choose to receive their monthly pay in two, approximately bi-weekly instalments.One goal of UC’s month-to-month calculation, based on actual earnings, is to eliminate some of the problems claimants faced withUK’s legacy social security systems. A previous benefit, WorkingTax Credits, had based claimants’ monthly payment on an average of earnings from the past year as reported to HMRC, and this aver-age could over- or under-estimated the benefit owed if a claimant's earnings changed. The discrepancies in reported versus actual earn-ings led claimants into debt to DWP if their earnings fell and rose but their tax credit payment stayed the same. UC aims to eliminate over- or under-payments to claimants – and falling into arrears toDWP – and reduce the burden on claimants to report changes in earnings [49]. DWP publishes very little documentation about UC’s perfor-mance data, “despite the evidence that the Universal Credit team have built up a modern analytics capability where real-time data would be the expectation” [57] (p.70). Likewise, it does not publish any public domain data about its digital services, with the exception of blog and a smattering of one-off research projects [3] nor about their source code [57]. While DWP has consulted the researchers of this project and asked us for updates on our findings in the form of reports, they did not agree to formal interviews about how the system works. Conducting research that can account for the experiences of people who claim Universal Credit is particularly crucial given DWP’s lack of transparency about how they study and understand the user experience. As will be shown later through the use of screenshots, our research gained insight into the interac-tion between claimants and social security agents, a largely unseen aspect of social security.In the following sections, we demonstrate how ALL methods focused on users of ADMS can be a powerful approach to collect data about systems, such as UC, that are highly complex and pose problems of access. [...] The data presented in this paper is from an ongoing qualitative, lon-gitudinal panel study conducted as part of a larger project exploring the lived experiences of recipients of UC.Our panel study commenced in mid-2022 and is expected to run until the end of 2023; this paper reports on data collected in the first six-month period of the study from participants who were recruited in 2022. The study applies two distinct methods of qualitative data collection for each participant: 1. semi-structured interviews and2. bi-weekly prompted updates sent over phone text asking about participants' interactions with UC.We recruited twenty-six participants through local charities by participating in their in-person events and by advertising the study their social media and mailing lists. Participants take part in the study over six or twelve months and were interviewed at the beginning of this period as well as after six months. Participants also receive text message prompts from the researchers roughly every two weeks asking for any updates on their interactions with UC. Participants used different methods to convey information: sending messages and sometimes screenshots of their interactions and accounts. Five participants at some point phoned the researchers to explain their situation rather than text. If asked for advice, researchers pointed participants to their case managers, work coachesand a local advice charity. The exception was a participant who had significant financial troubles, and the researchers believed that the participants’ children were at serious risk. On this occasion the researchers recommended a specific financial aid the participant could apply for.We gave participants a £25 shopping voucher after their first interview and a second one for a second interview at the six-month period to reimburse them for their time. The first interviews with each participant lasted for approximately forty-five minutes and were conducted either online or in person at local charity offices,cafés or at the University of Edinburgh. Follow up interviews lasted 15-30 minutes. The four participants whose quotes are used below reviewed and consented to their quotations and the representation of their stories.Data collection for this study was not without challenges. Twoparticipants never responded to the prompts and were eventually removed from the study. Twenty-one respondents provided us with relevant data about their interactions with Universal Credit; the rest,despite replying to prompts, either did not share any information that was related to the study or did not experience any problems with US during the first six months.We refer to our participants by pseudonyms. As some of our data was based on text messages and screenshots from our participants,quotes from these data sources often contain incorrect spelling or grammar. In order to preserve the original voice of our partici-pants, we kept these as they were, unless changes were crucial for intelligibility.The results of our study cannot be interpreted without taking the limitations of this study into consideration. Firstly, as is often the case with qualitative research, our sample was not representative,so the findings are not generalizable. Secondly, the language of the interviews and data collection in general was English; therefore,our study only includes participants who were able to speak inEnglish at least on a conversational level. Thirdly, our sample has a high number of participants who identify as female, thus, the view of male and non-binary participants are less pronounced in our dataset.Researchers received ethics approval for the study from theUniversity of Edinburgh. [...] The RTI to UC data pipeline, as mentioned, entails the flow of data from claimants’ employers to HMRC, where it becomes aggregated in its Real Time Information system. Though the data is collected for tax purposes, HMRC shares this data with UC daily, and UC uses it to adjust claimants’ monthly UC payment.As is the case with many vital infrastructures when they breakdown [69], the pipeline became most visible to claimants when errors were made at some point in these data exchange processes. RTI error rates are endemic to the system. The UK’s National AuditOffice (NAO) reported in 2018 that UC is “sensitive to any change in claimants’ monthly income” and “employers sometimes supply information [to RTI] that is late or which contains errors”[54](p.61). NAO estimated that in 2017-18, UC made overpayment of 7.2 percent and underpayments of 1.3 percent in part for this reason. [54] A result of these errors are fluctuations in claimants pay, making it difficult to budget and plan.Participants’ accounts detail the steps they took to rectify the errors. In some cases, claimants contacted their employer and UCto report the error, but they then had little agency over the timing of its correction. The only data seen as relevant by UC to rectifying the pay calculation is the HMRC RTI data, not any evidence offered by the claimant.Gaja, a white Polish woman in her late 40s raising two children,experienced an RTI error during the course of the study. In her first interview in June 2022, she described her case as relatively simple,telling us, “for me personally it works great,” even though working at a charity as a case worker she had seen problems with the paycalculation affecting her clients.In October 2022 Gaja reported over a text that she had received more payment from UC than anticipated and assumed her earnings had not been reported to HMRC, resulting in larger-than-usual UCentitlement; she wrote, “Something was not reported to [HMRC]and I told them [UC] that my award is too high, but, they can’t do anything about it, need to wait for hmrc information.”Gaja was not worried about budgeting but understood such mistakes could pose problems for others:I’ve got far too much money that I need to return [toUC], not really changing anything if you are aware of the mistake, this could be a different story if I wouldn't understand how they work and spend all the money.She pursued the matter with UC, then told us in early November,“they [UC] are still waiting for my employer to send the report sofar no news.” By late November she was still waiting for an update on the case.When we interviewed Gaja a second time in January, she told us that HMRC had finally reported the September earnings two months later in December, and the overpayment from UC wouldnow be deducted automatically from her future UC payments. Heremployer told GaJa they had reported the earnings on time, so she never received an explanation for the delay and assumed that the mistake was due to her holding two jobs, and that HMRC had notregistered the wages for one. Gaja shared that she did not feel she could affect or speed up the process:I’ve informed universal credit that this will be a mis-take in payment. But they didn’t ask me about my wage slip or anything like that, they just said that it will clear up when they clear up because they need to listen to HMRC and not what I’m going to say.Gaja told us she was satisfied with how the situation was resolved and still much preferred UC, with its month-to-month calculations,to the older system used by Tax Credits, based on retrospective earnings data that so often led to overpayments and debt.Another participant in our study expressed more distress when she found an RTI error. Emily, who identifies as Black Caribbeanand white, is a single mother of two children in her late thirties. Sheworks as an administrator for a center that provides a safe place for children to meet parents they do not live with. In her first interview she was very unhappy with Universal Credit, highlighting that in the approximately three years she had been receiving it, she never felt supported and had received conflicting and wrong information [...] on her case from case workers and work coaches. She had also encountered difficulties reclaiming childcare costs.In mid-January 2023, Emily shared over a text that her employer made an error reporting her salary in November 2022, and as a result she received £300 less in her January payment than she was entitled to. Emily wrote, “I know the whole system [. . . ] is an absolute shambles. They are causing more hardship, it’s a horrible situation.” Emily shared screenshots of her exchange with her UC case manager after she reported the error in December. Her case manager told her that they would not be able to take action until January – UC needed to wait for confirmation from HMRC, which,in turn, needed a report from Emily’s employer. At the end ofDecember, she wrote to her case manager: “There is surely another way to rectify this so that I am not in financial crisis again. This is now adding to my mental health as I am not sleeping worrying.”(See Fig. 1)By mid-January Emily was distraught, texting us, “So I’m cur-rently waiting for that dispute to be resolved as I am once again out of pocket and struggling because of an error.”When we checked in at the end of January, Emily let us know,happily, that the error has been fixed thanks to her employer’s swift response: “My employer were very helpful and contacted HMRC atspeed and UC put the difference into my account on Friday. [. . . ]My work has been amazing, thankfully.”Despite this, Emily had experienced difficulties during this two-month period of uncertainty, writing, “Just frustrating [that] I had to get an advance on my wage from my work to survive. In addition to RTI-related errors, UC’s dynamic monthly payment presents another challenge for some working claimants. Noted previously by the Child Poverty Action Group [14] and Human RightsWatch [72], a punitive discrepancy can occur when a claimant's monthly assessment period, which reflects the amount of earnings a person receives within its time frame, is not in alignment with the period of work covered by the earnings. For most claimants,particularly those paid monthly, the UC assessment period will not pose problems. However, according to DWP’s own analysis,around 25 percent of claimants will find their benefits reduced because they are paid every two or four weeks. People who are not paid monthly but rather every two or four weeks will encounter certain assessment periods over the course of a year that captures two payments at once, one at the beginning and one at the end of the period. For instance, someone who receives their wage every four weeks will receive two sets of wages in one assessment pe-riod, roughly once every 13 months, and may receive reduced or no UC payment following this. DWP, well aware of this problem,calls these dual temporalities “different earning patterns” in their guidance on their official website. We detail what two users revealabout UC by interrogating the effects of the fixed assessment period on their payment.Fiona, a white Scottish woman, is a single mother in her late thirties with two children. She works as a cleaner for a school that pays her every four weeks. In her first interview she told us she was experiencing significant difficulties understanding the UC payment calculation and anticipating her monthly payment. At the beginning of August – six weeks after her first interview – she reported that she was trying to get information from UC, both through her online account and the phone helpline, regarding her entitlement. Fiona worried that, due to being paid every four weeks, she would not gether entitlement in an upcoming month. She wrote to us via text, “Itried phone uc to be told [to] write my worries and questions online,so i have done this yesterday and waiting on response.” Knowing Far in advance whether she would get her entitlement especially mattered as her children are “not entitled to school meals so [she would] need to make sure [her] kids have lunch money”.Throughout August, September and October we received fre-quent, instant updates from Fiona on her interactions with differentUC case workers as she tried to understand when she would not receive a UC payment. Fiona’s updates included screenshots of messages she exchanged with case managers and phone calls elab-orating her worries and confusion. (See Fig. 2)At the end of September, Fiona shared that she still had not received a definitive answer regarding the month she would not receive UC payment: “I don’t know if it will be november or decem-ber or both i don’t get paid , it’s horrible.” In October she wrote,“the system is hellish”.She finally learned she would not receive UC payment in No-vember from her UC statement that month, sent only a few days before her payment would have been put in her bank account. Shewrote over text, “I’m not getting a november pay it’s come up £0 no one told me.”Throughout, she interacted with several different case managers.In our second interview in mid-January 2023, she told us how frus-trating and impersonal these interactions were: “Even [just] the same person replying to me would be better than a half assed con-versation.” She described her experience during the previous three months, saying, “I keep emailing them and writing, ‘Good after-noon, could someone help me understand the calculation behind this madness?’.” She shared that she had borrowed money from her son to “to keep [her] head above water until [she] get[s] paid.”Conflicts between employers’ payment policies and the UC as-sessment period can happen as people start new jobs or change their working hours. Jennifer, a white Scottish woman, is a single mother of two children in her early thirties who worked 16 hours a week as a family support worker when we first interviewed her inJune 2022. Overall, Jennifer seemed content with UC, though she had once experienced a mix-up with her wage-reporting that she said had been quickly resolved.In July she left her job due to mental health difficulties. UC required her to look for 25 hours of work to qualify for the benefit,and by October she found a 16 hour-a-week contract serving school dinners. She worried this change in employment would affect UCs automated payment since her new employer had not yet paid her first wages for the month of October. In mid-October she sent a text to say she feared she would receive no UC payment the fol-lowing month: “If [my wage payment] doesn’t fall into the window that [UC] create. 21 to 21st of each month I wont receive any payment.” If she was paid for her October hours and November Hours in the same month, then her combined earnings could put her over the threshold to qualify for UC, resulting in no UC payment in November.When we interviewed Jennifer again in January, she informed us that, indeed, her employer’s late October pay had resulted ina “dip” in UC – though her November payment “wasn’t zero, no,it just wasn’t as high as what [she] thought”.

This is now adding to my mental health as I am not sleeping worrying.”(See Fig. 1)By mid-January Emily was distraught, texting us, “So I’m cur-rently waiting for that dispute to be resolved as I am once again out of pocket and struggling because of an error.”When we checked in at the end of January, Emily let us know,happily, that the error has been fixed thanks to her employer’s swift response: “My employer were very helpful and contacted HMRC atspeed and UC put the difference into my account on Friday. [. . . ]My work has been amazing, thankfully.”Despite this, Emily had experienced difficulties during this two-month period of uncertainty, writing, “Just frustrating [that] I had to get an advance on my wage from my work to survive. In addition to RTI-related errors, UC’s dynamic monthly payment presents another challenge for some working claimants. Noted previously by the Child Poverty Action Group [14] and Human RightsWatch [72], a punitive discrepancy can occur when a claimant's monthly assessment period, which reflects the amount of earnings a person receives within its time frame, is not in alignment with the period of work covered by the earnings. For most claimants,particularly those paid monthly, the UC assessment period will not pose problems. However, according to DWP’s own analysis,around 25 percent of claimants will find their benefits reduced because they are paid every two or four weeks. People who are not paid monthly but rather every two or four weeks will encounter certain assessment periods over the course of a year that captures two payments at once, one at the beginning and one at the end of the period. For instance, someone who receives their wage every four weeks will receive two sets of wages in one assessment pe-riod, roughly once every 13 months, and may receive reduced or no UC payment following this. DWP, well aware of this problem,calls these dual temporalities “different earning patterns” in their guidance on their official website. We detail what two users revealabout UC by interrogating the effects of the fixed assessment period on their payment.Fiona, a white Scottish woman, is a single mother in her late thirties with two children. She works as a cleaner for a school that pays her every four weeks. In her first interview she told us she was experiencing significant difficulties understanding the UC payment calculation and anticipating her monthly payment. At the beginning of August – six weeks after her first interview – she reported that she was trying to get information from UC, both through her online account and the phone helpline, regarding her entitlement. Fiona worried that, due to being paid every four weeks, she would not gether entitlement in an upcoming month. She wrote to us via text, “Itried phone uc to be told [to] write my worries and questions online,so i have done this yesterday and waiting on response.” Knowing Far in advance whether she would get her entitlement especially mattered as her children are “not entitled to school meals so [she would] need to make sure [her] kids have lunch money”.Throughout August, September and October we received fre-quent, instant updates from Fiona on her interactions with differentUC case workers as she tried to understand when she would not receive a UC payment. Fiona’s updates included screenshots of messages she exchanged with case managers and phone calls elab-orating her worries and confusion. (See Fig. 2)At the end of September, Fiona shared that she still had not received a definitive answer regarding the month she would not receive UC payment: “I don’t know if it will be november or decem-ber or both i don’t get paid , it’s horrible.” In October she wrote,“the system is hellish”.She finally learned she would not receive UC payment in No-vember from her UC statement that month, sent only a few days before her payment would have been put in her bank account. Shewrote over text, “I’m not getting a november pay it’s come up £0 no one told me.”Throughout, she interacted with several different case managers.In our second interview in mid-January 2023, she told us how frus-trating and impersonal these interactions were: “Even [just] the same person replying to me would be better than a half assed con-versation.” She described her experience during the previous three months, saying, “I keep emailing them and writing, ‘Good after-noon, could someone help me understand the calculation behind this madness?’.” She shared that she had borrowed money from her son to “to keep [her] head above water until [she] get[s] paid.”Conflicts between employers’ payment policies and the UC as-sessment period can happen as people start new jobs or change their working hours. Jennifer, a white Scottish woman, is a single mother of two children in her early thirties who worked 16 hours a week as a family support worker when we first interviewed her inJune 2022. Overall, Jennifer seemed content with UC, though she had once experienced a mix-up with her wage-reporting that she said had been quickly resolved.In July she left her job due to mental health difficulties. UC required her to look for 25 hours of work to qualify for the benefit,and by October she found a 16 hour-a-week contract serving school dinners. She worried this change in employment would affect UCs automated payment since her new employer had not yet paid her first wages for the month of October. In mid-October she sent a text to say she feared she would receive no UC payment the fol-lowing month: “If [my wage payment] doesn’t fall into the window that [UC] create. 21 to 21st of each month I wont receive any payment.” If she was paid for her October hours and November Hours in the same month, then her combined earnings could put her over the threshold to qualify for UC, resulting in no UC payment in November.When we interviewed Jennifer again in January, she informed us that, indeed, her employer’s late October pay had resulted ina “dip” in UC – though her November payment “wasn’t zero, no,it just wasn’t as high as what [she] thought”. She expressed her frustration with UC’s rigid assessment period and how it accounts for when you are paid according to HMRC, but not the period you actually worked I’d waited a long time for my first wage so it looks like they had paid me twice. [. . . ] They put it in the same month so it looked like I got more which is a really frustrating part of universal credit.Jennifer also partly blamed herself for her changing circumstances;she had quit the school dinner post in early December to take another job in January as a pupil support assistant – a position she was excited about and felt more qualified for – for 25 hours a week.Reflecting on her two jobs Jennifer told us, “It is partly my fault, Ihave leapt from job to job in such a short amount of time.",1103-8,report their employees’ earnings using payroll software ,
18,DataOnUCExperience,Artifact,"we draw on an ongoing, empirical study examining Universal Credit (UC), an automated social security payment used in the United Kingdom. UC uses a dynamic, means-testing payment calculation to determine the monthly amount of claim people are entitled to. In this study we use serial interviews plus phone texts as prompts for solicit-ing feedback from users. We argue that ALL provides a unique opportunity to gather information on ADMS, both over time and in situ. Capturing information over time allows for more granular accounts of dynamic trajectories. Through the personal accounts of users reacting in situ, QLR also gives researchers insight into the emotional dimensions of users’ interactions with ADMS.In the following literature review, we cover the challenges schol-ars have confronted while studying ADMS, how scholars have studied users of ADMS to overcome these challenges, and the value and drawbacks of longitudinal research. [...] Administered by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP),Universal Credit is the UK’s largest social security payment. DWPintroduced UC in 2012, and it is set to replace some of the previ-ous benefits by 2024. The DWP terms UC ‘digital-by-default’ [27] since recipients apply for and receive payments through an online account. The account also acts as the primary mode of communica-tion with DWP staff (though people unable to maintain the online account can opt to interact solely by phone). UC is a means-tested and conditional benefit; to qualify, some claimants must work or look for work for a certain number of hours per week, based on their capability to work and certain life circumstances, such as having dependents.This study focuses on an essential automated decision-making feature of UC: its dynamic payment algorithm. UC uses automation to determine the amount of money claimants receive each month,based on calculating data points collected during a prior monthly assessment period. The monthly assessment period is a personal-ized unit of time based on the day a person applied for the benefit –for instance, if a person applies on February 15th, their assessment period will be from the 15th of a given month until the 14th of the next month. Claimants’ start with a ‘minimum standard allowance based on their age and relationship status (either single or living with a partner) and other factors such as disability or number of dependents. Payments will then be adjusted negatively depending on monthly earnings and deductions. Deductions include repayments for advance claims the claimant may have been granted in the past,past overpayments from UC and third-party deductions made at the request of a creditor, including rent arrears, utility arrears, Council Tax bill arrears, child support maintenance and fines by UC.For those working, the adjustments to UC based on monthly earnings happen automatically through a data exchange with theHMRC’s (HM Revenue and Customs) Real Time Information (RTI)system. Employers report their employees’ earnings using payroll software to RTI for tax purposes, and DWP accesses this stream of data daily. A report by Human Rights Watch [72] uses the metaphor of a camera to describe how STI affects the UC monthly assessment period:If the RTI system is a camera, the assessment period functions like a timer that tells it when to take a photo.The resulting snapshot is the earnings data that Universal Credit’s algorithm uses to calculate an individ-ual’s benefit payment for that month.UC considers all income that is reported to HMRC for self-reported by the claimant to UC during each monthly assessment period,and the UC payment decreases accordingly. After the monthly assessment of earnings, most claimants in the UK receive their payment once a month. In Scotland, people can choose to receive their monthly pay in two, approximately bi-weekly instalments.One goal of UC’s month-to-month calculation, based on actual earnings, is to eliminate some of the problems claimants faced withUK’s legacy social security systems. A previous benefit, WorkingTax Credits, had based claimants’ monthly payment on an average of earnings from the past year as reported to HMRC, and this aver-age could over- or under-estimated the benefit owed if a claimant's earnings changed. The discrepancies in reported versus actual earn-ings led claimants into debt to DWP if their earnings fell and rose but their tax credit payment stayed the same. UC aims to eliminate over- or under-payments to claimants – and falling into arrears toDWP – and reduce the burden on claimants to report changes in earnings [49]. DWP publishes very little documentation about UC’s perfor-mance data, “despite the evidence that the Universal Credit team have built up a modern analytics capability where real-time data would be the expectation” [57] (p.70). Likewise, it does not publish any public domain data about its digital services, with the exception of blog and a smattering of one-off research projects [3] nor about their source code [57]. While DWP has consulted the researchers of this project and asked us for updates on our findings in the form of reports, they did not agree to formal interviews about how the system works. Conducting research that can account for the experiences of people who claim Universal Credit is particularly crucial given DWP’s lack of transparency about how they study and understand the user experience. As will be shown later through the use of screenshots, our research gained insight into the interac-tion between claimants and social security agents, a largely unseen aspect of social security.In the following sections, we demonstrate how ALL methods focused on users of ADMS can be a powerful approach to collect data about systems, such as UC, that are highly complex and pose problems of access. [...] The data presented in this paper is from an ongoing qualitative, lon-gitudinal panel study conducted as part of a larger project exploring the lived experiences of recipients of UC.Our panel study commenced in mid-2022 and is expected to run until the end of 2023; this paper reports on data collected in the first six-month period of the study from participants who were recruited in 2022. The study applies two distinct methods of qualitative data collection for each participant: 1. semi-structured interviews and2. bi-weekly prompted updates sent over phone text asking about participants' interactions with UC.We recruited twenty-six participants through local charities by participating in their in-person events and by advertising the study their social media and mailing lists. Participants take part in the study over six or twelve months and were interviewed at the beginning of this period as well as after six months. Participants also receive text message prompts from the researchers roughly every two weeks asking for any updates on their interactions with UC. Participants used different methods to convey information: sending messages and sometimes screenshots of their interactions and accounts. Five participants at some point phoned the researchers to explain their situation rather than text. If asked for advice, researchers pointed participants to their case managers, work coachesand a local advice charity. The exception was a participant who had significant financial troubles, and the researchers believed that the participants’ children were at serious risk. On this occasion the researchers recommended a specific financial aid the participant could apply for.We gave participants a £25 shopping voucher after their first interview and a second one for a second interview at the six-month period to reimburse them for their time. The first interviews with each participant lasted for approximately forty-five minutes and were conducted either online or in person at local charity offices,cafés or at the University of Edinburgh. Follow up interviews lasted 15-30 minutes. The four participants whose quotes are used below reviewed and consented to their quotations and the representation of their stories.Data collection for this study was not without challenges. Twoparticipants never responded to the prompts and were eventually removed from the study. Twenty-one respondents provided us with relevant data about their interactions with Universal Credit; the rest,despite replying to prompts, either did not share any information that was related to the study or did not experience any problems with US during the first six months.We refer to our participants by pseudonyms. As some of our data was based on text messages and screenshots from our participants,quotes from these data sources often contain incorrect spelling or grammar. In order to preserve the original voice of our partici-pants, we kept these as they were, unless changes were crucial for intelligibility.The results of our study cannot be interpreted without taking the limitations of this study into consideration. Firstly, as is often the case with qualitative research, our sample was not representative,so the findings are not generalizable. Secondly, the language of the interviews and data collection in general was English; therefore,our study only includes participants who were able to speak inEnglish at least on a conversational level. Thirdly, our sample has a high number of participants who identify as female, thus, the view of male and non-binary participants are less pronounced in our dataset.Researchers received ethics approval for the study from theUniversity of Edinburgh. [...] The RTI to UC data pipeline, as mentioned, entails the flow of data from claimants’ employers to HMRC, where it becomes aggregated in its Real Time Information system. Though the data is collected for tax purposes, HMRC shares this data with UC daily, and UC uses it to adjust claimants’ monthly UC payment.As is the case with many vital infrastructures when they breakdown [69], the pipeline became most visible to claimants when errors were made at some point in these data exchange processes. RTI error rates are endemic to the system. The UK’s National AuditOffice (NAO) reported in 2018 that UC is “sensitive to any change in claimants’ monthly income” and “employers sometimes supply information [to RTI] that is late or which contains errors”[54](p.61). NAO estimated that in 2017-18, UC made overpayment of 7.2 percent and underpayments of 1.3 percent in part for this reason. [54] A result of these errors are fluctuations in claimants pay, making it difficult to budget and plan.Participants’ accounts detail the steps they took to rectify the errors. In some cases, claimants contacted their employer and UCto report the error, but they then had little agency over the timing of its correction. The only data seen as relevant by UC to rectifying the pay calculation is the HMRC RTI data, not any evidence offered by the claimant.Gaja, a white Polish woman in her late 40s raising two children,experienced an RTI error during the course of the study. In her first interview in June 2022, she described her case as relatively simple,telling us, “for me personally it works great,” even though working at a charity as a case worker she had seen problems with the paycalculation affecting her clients.In October 2022 Gaja reported over a text that she had received more payment from UC than anticipated and assumed her earnings had not been reported to HMRC, resulting in larger-than-usual UCentitlement; she wrote, “Something was not reported to [HMRC]and I told them [UC] that my award is too high, but, they can’t do anything about it, need to wait for hmrc information.”Gaja was not worried about budgeting but understood such mistakes could pose problems for others:I’ve got far too much money that I need to return [toUC], not really changing anything if you are aware of the mistake, this could be a different story if I wouldn't understand how they work and spend all the money.She pursued the matter with UC, then told us in early November,“they [UC] are still waiting for my employer to send the report sofar no news.” By late November she was still waiting for an update on the case.When we interviewed Gaja a second time in January, she told us that HMRC had finally reported the September earnings two months later in December, and the overpayment from UC wouldnow be deducted automatically from her future UC payments. Heremployer told GaJa they had reported the earnings on time, so she never received an explanation for the delay and assumed that the mistake was due to her holding two jobs, and that HMRC had notregistered the wages for one. Gaja shared that she did not feel she could affect or speed up the process:I’ve informed universal credit that this will be a mis-take in payment. But they didn’t ask me about my wage slip or anything like that, they just said that it will clear up when they clear up because they need to listen to HMRC and not what I’m going to say.Gaja told us she was satisfied with how the situation was resolved and still much preferred UC, with its month-to-month calculations,to the older system used by Tax Credits, based on retrospective earnings data that so often led to overpayments and debt.Another participant in our study expressed more distress when she found an RTI error. Emily, who identifies as Black Caribbeanand white, is a single mother of two children in her late thirties. Sheworks as an administrator for a center that provides a safe place for children to meet parents they do not live with. In her first interview she was very unhappy with Universal Credit, highlighting that in the approximately three years she had been receiving it, she never felt supported and had received conflicting and wrong information [...] on her case from case workers and work coaches. She had also encountered difficulties reclaiming childcare costs.In mid-January 2023, Emily shared over a text that her employer made an error reporting her salary in November 2022, and as a result she received £300 less in her January payment than she was entitled to. Emily wrote, “I know the whole system [. . . ] is an absolute shambles. They are causing more hardship, it’s a horrible situation.” Emily shared screenshots of her exchange with her UC case manager after she reported the error in December. Her case manager told her that they would not be able to take action until January – UC needed to wait for confirmation from HMRC, which,in turn, needed a report from Emily’s employer. At the end ofDecember, she wrote to her case manager: “There is surely another way to rectify this so that I am not in financial crisis again. This is now adding to my mental health as I am not sleeping worrying.”(See Fig. 1)By mid-January Emily was distraught, texting us, “So I’m cur-rently waiting for that dispute to be resolved as I am once again out of pocket and struggling because of an error.”When we checked in at the end of January, Emily let us know,happily, that the error has been fixed thanks to her employer’s swift response: “My employer were very helpful and contacted HMRC atspeed and UC put the difference into my account on Friday. [. . . ]My work has been amazing, thankfully.”Despite this, Emily had experienced difficulties during this two-month period of uncertainty, writing, “Just frustrating [that] I had to get an advance on my wage from my work to survive. In addition to RTI-related errors, UC’s dynamic monthly payment presents another challenge for some working claimants.

[...] The RTI to UC data pipeline, as mentioned, entails the flow of data from claimants’ employers to HMRC, where it becomes aggregated in its Real Time Information system. Though the data is collected for tax purposes, HMRC shares this data with UC daily, and UC uses it to adjust claimants’ monthly UC payment.As is the case with many vital infrastructures when they breakdown [69], the pipeline became most visible to claimants when errors were made at some point in these data exchange processes. RTI error rates are endemic to the system. The UK’s National AuditOffice (NAO) reported in 2018 that UC is “sensitive to any change in claimants’ monthly income” and “employers sometimes supply information [to RTI] that is late or which contains errors”[54](p.61). NAO estimated that in 2017-18, UC made overpayment of 7.2 percent and underpayments of 1.3 percent in part for this reason. [54] A result of these errors are fluctuations in claimants pay, making it difficult to budget and plan.Participants’ accounts detail the steps they took to rectify the errors. In some cases, claimants contacted their employer and UCto report the error, but they then had little agency over the timing of its correction. The only data seen as relevant by UC to rectifying the pay calculation is the HMRC RTI data, not any evidence offered by the claimant.Gaja, a white Polish woman in her late 40s raising two children,experienced an RTI error during the course of the study. In her first interview in June 2022, she described her case as relatively simple,telling us, “for me personally it works great,” even though working at a charity as a case worker she had seen problems with the paycalculation affecting her clients.In October 2022 Gaja reported over a text that she had received more payment from UC than anticipated and assumed her earnings had not been reported to HMRC, resulting in larger-than-usual UCentitlement; she wrote, “Something was not reported to [HMRC]and I told them [UC] that my award is too high, but, they can’t do anything about it, need to wait for hmrc information.”Gaja was not worried about budgeting but understood such mistakes could pose problems for others:I’ve got far too much money that I need to return [toUC], not really changing anything if you are aware of the mistake, this could be a different story if I wouldn't understand how they work and spend all the money.She pursued the matter with UC, then told us in early November,“they [UC] are still waiting for my employer to send the report sofar no news.” By late November she was still waiting for an update on the case.When we interviewed Gaja a second time in January, she told us that HMRC had finally reported the September earnings two months later in December, and the overpayment from UC wouldnow be deducted automatically from her future UC payments. Heremployer told GaJa they had reported the earnings on time, so she never received an explanation for the delay and assumed that the mistake was due to her holding two jobs, and that HMRC had notregistered the wages for one. Gaja shared that she did not feel she could affect or speed up the process:I’ve informed universal credit that this will be a mis-take in payment. But they didn’t ask me about my wage slip or anything like that, they just said that it will clear up when they clear up because they need to listen to HMRC and not what I’m going to say.Gaja told us she was satisfied with how the situation was resolved and still much preferred UC, with its month-to-month calculations,to the older system used by Tax Credits, based on retrospective earnings data that so often led to overpayments and debt.Another participant in our study expressed more distress when she found an RTI error. Emily, who identifies as Black Caribbeanand white, is a single mother of two children in her late thirties. Sheworks as an administrator for a center that provides a safe place for children to meet parents they do not live with. In her first interview she was very unhappy with Universal Credit, highlighting that in the approximately three years she had been receiving it, she never felt supported and had received conflicting and wrong information [...] on her case from case workers and work coaches. She had also encountered difficulties reclaiming childcare costs.In mid-January 2023, Emily shared over a text that her employer made an error reporting her salary in November 2022, and as a result she received £300 less in her January payment than she was entitled to. Emily wrote, “I know the whole system [. . . ] is an absolute shambles. They are causing more hardship, it’s a horrible situation.” Emily shared screenshots of her exchange with her UC case manager after she reported the error in December. Her case manager told her that they would not be able to take action until January – UC needed to wait for confirmation from HMRC, which,in turn, needed a report from Emily’s employer. At the end ofDecember, she wrote to her case manager: “There is surely another way to rectify this so that I am not in financial crisis again. This is now adding to my mental health as I am not sleeping worrying.”(See Fig. 1)By mid-January Emily was distraught, texting us, “So I’m cur-rently waiting for that dispute to be resolved as I am once again out of pocket and struggling because of an error.”When we checked in at the end of January, Emily let us know,happily, that the error has been fixed thanks to her employer’s swift response: “My employer were very helpful and contacted HMRC atspeed and UC put the difference into my account on Friday. [. . . ]My work has been amazing, thankfully.”Despite this, Emily had experienced difficulties during this two-month period of uncertainty, writing, “Just frustrating [that] I had to get an advance on my wage from my work to survive. In addition to RTI-related errors, UC’s dynamic monthly payment presents another challenge for some working claimants. Noted previously by the Child Poverty Action Group [14] and Human RightsWatch [72], a punitive discrepancy can occur when a claimant's monthly assessment period, which reflects the amount of earnings a person receives within its time frame, is not in alignment with the period of work covered by the earnings. For most claimants,particularly those paid monthly, the UC assessment period will not pose problems. However, according to DWP’s own analysis,around 25 percent of claimants will find their benefits reduced because they are paid every two or four weeks. People who are not paid monthly but rather every two or four weeks will encounter certain assessment periods over the course of a year that captures two payments at once, one at the beginning and one at the end of the period. For instance, someone who receives their wage every four weeks will receive two sets of wages in one assessment pe-riod, roughly once every 13 months, and may receive reduced or no UC payment following this. DWP, well aware of this problem,calls these dual temporalities “different earning patterns” in their guidance on their official website. We detail what two users revealabout UC by interrogating the effects of the fixed assessment period on their payment.Fiona, a white Scottish woman, is a single mother in her late thirties with two children. She works as a cleaner for a school that pays her every four weeks. In her first interview she told us she was experiencing significant difficulties understanding the UC payment calculation and anticipating her monthly payment. At the beginning of August – six weeks after her first interview – she reported that she was trying to get information from UC, both through her online account and the phone helpline, regarding her entitlement. Fiona worried that, due to being paid every four weeks, she would not gether entitlement in an upcoming month. She wrote to us via text, “Itried phone uc to be told [to] write my worries and questions online,so i have done this yesterday and waiting on response.” Knowing Far in advance whether she would get her entitlement especially mattered as her children are “not entitled to school meals so [she would] need to make sure [her] kids have lunch money”.Throughout August, September and October we received fre-quent, instant updates from Fiona on her interactions with differentUC case workers as she tried to understand when she would not receive a UC payment. Fiona’s updates included screenshots of messages she exchanged with case managers and phone calls elab-orating her worries and confusion. (See Fig. 2)At the end of September, Fiona shared that she still had not received a definitive answer regarding the month she would not receive UC payment: “I don’t know if it will be november or decem-ber or both i don’t get paid , it’s horrible.” In October she wrote,“the system is hellish”.She finally learned she would not receive UC payment in No-vember from her UC statement that month, sent only a few days before her payment would have been put in her bank account. Shewrote over text, “I’m not getting a november pay it’s come up £0 no one told me.”Throughout, she interacted with several different case managers.In our second interview in mid-January 2023, she told us how frus-trating and impersonal these interactions were: “Even [just] the same person replying to me would be better than a half assed con-versation.” She described her experience during the previous three months, saying, “I keep emailing them and writing, ‘Good after-noon, could someone help me understand the calculation behind this madness?’.” She shared that she had borrowed money from her son to “to keep [her] head above water until [she] get[s] paid.”Conflicts between employers’ payment policies and the UC as-sessment period can happen as people start new jobs or change their working hours. Jennifer, a white Scottish woman, is a single mother of two children in her early thirties who worked 16 hours a week as a family support worker when we first interviewed her inJune 2022. Overall, Jennifer seemed content with UC, though she had once experienced a mix-up with her wage-reporting that she said had been quickly resolved.In July she left her job due to mental health difficulties. UC required her to look for 25 hours of work to qualify for the benefit,and by October she found a 16 hour-a-week contract serving school dinners. She worried this change in employment would affect UCs automated payment since her new employer had not yet paid her first wages for the month of October. In mid-October she sent a text to say she feared she would receive no UC payment the fol-lowing month: “If [my wage payment] doesn’t fall into the window that [UC] create. 21 to 21st of each month I wont receive any payment.” If she was paid for her October hours and November Hours in the same month, then her combined earnings could put her over the threshold to qualify for UC, resulting in no UC payment in November.When we interviewed Jennifer again in January, she informed us that, indeed, her employer’s late October pay had resulted ina “dip” in UC – though her November payment “wasn’t zero, no,it just wasn’t as high as what [she] thought”. She expressed her frustration with UC’s rigid assessment period and how it accounts for when you are paid according to HMRC, but not the period you actually worked I’d waited a long time for my first wage so it looks like they had paid me twice. [. . . ] They put it in the same month so it looked like I got more which is a really frustrating part of universal credit.Jennifer also partly blamed herself for her changing circumstances;she had quit the school dinner post in early December to take another job in January as a pupil support assistant – a position she was excited about and felt more qualified for – for 25 hours a week.Reflecting on her two jobs Jennifer told us, “It is partly my fault, Ihave leapt from job to job in such a short amount of time.",1103-8,so that I am not in financial crisis again. This is now adding to my mental health as I am not sleeping worrying.,

23,UnitedKingdom,hasProducedArtifact,UniversalCredit,"we draw on an ongoing, empirical study examining Universal Credit (UC), an automated social security payment used in the United Kingdom. UC uses a dynamic, means-testing payment calculation to determine the monthly amount of claim people are entitled to. In this study we use serial interviews plus phone texts as prompts for solicit-ing feedback from users. We argue that ALL provides a unique opportunity to gather information on ADMS, both over time and in situ. Capturing information over time allows for more granular accounts of dynamic trajectories. Through the personal accounts of users reacting in situ, QLR also gives researchers insight into the emotional dimensions of users’ interactions with ADMS.In the following literature review, we cover the challenges schol-ars have confronted while studying ADMS, how scholars have studied users of ADMS to overcome these challenges, and the value and drawbacks of longitudinal research. [...] Administered by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP),Universal Credit is the UK’s largest social security payment. DWPintroduced UC in 2012, and it is set to replace some of the previ-ous benefits by 2024. The DWP terms UC ‘digital-by-default’ [27] since recipients apply for and receive payments through an online account. The account also acts as the primary mode of communica-tion with DWP staff (though people unable to maintain the online account can opt to interact solely by phone). UC is a means-tested and conditional benefit; to qualify, some claimants must work or look for work for a certain number of hours per week, based on their capability to work and certain life circumstances, such as having dependents.This study focuses on an essential automated decision-making feature of UC: its dynamic payment algorithm. UC uses automation to determine the amount of money claimants receive each month,based on calculating data points collected during a prior monthly assessment period. The monthly assessment period is a personal-ized unit of time based on the day a person applied for the benefit –for instance, if a person applies on February 15th, their assessment period will be from the 15th of a given month until the 14th of the next month. Claimants’ start with a ‘minimum standard allowance based on their age and relationship status (either single or living with a partner) and other factors such as disability or number of dependents. Payments will then be adjusted negatively depending on monthly earnings and deductions. Deductions include repayments for advance claims the claimant may have been granted in the past,past overpayments from UC and third-party deductions made at the request of a creditor, including rent arrears, utility arrears, Council Tax bill arrears, child support maintenance and fines by UC.For those working, the adjustments to UC based on monthly earnings happen automatically through a data exchange with theHMRC’s (HM Revenue and Customs) Real Time Information (RTI)system. Employers report their employees’ earnings using payroll software to RTI for tax purposes, and DWP accesses this stream of data daily. A report by Human Rights Watch [72] uses the metaphor of a camera to describe how STI affects the UC monthly assessment period:If the RTI system is a camera, the assessment period functions like a timer that tells it when to take a photo.The resulting snapshot is the earnings data that Universal Credit’s algorithm uses to calculate an individ-ual’s benefit payment for that month.UC considers all income that is reported to HMRC for self-reported by the claimant to UC during each monthly assessment period,and the UC payment decreases accordingly. After the monthly assessment of earnings, most claimants in the UK receive their payment once a month. In Scotland, people can choose to receive their monthly pay in two, approximately bi-weekly instalments.One goal of UC’s month-to-month calculation, based on actual earnings, is to eliminate some of the problems claimants faced withUK’s legacy social security systems. A previous benefit, WorkingTax Credits, had based claimants’ monthly payment on an average of earnings from the past year as reported to HMRC, and this aver-age could over- or under-estimated the benefit owed if a claimant's earnings changed. The discrepancies in reported versus actual earn-ings led claimants into debt to DWP if their earnings fell and rose but their tax credit payment stayed the same. UC aims to eliminate over- or under-payments to claimants – and falling into arrears toDWP – and reduce the burden on claimants to report changes in earnings [49]. DWP publishes very little documentation about UC’s perfor-mance data, “despite the evidence that the Universal Credit team have built up a modern analytics capability where real-time data would be the expectation” [57] (p.70). Likewise, it does not publish any public domain data about its digital services, with the exception of blog and a smattering of one-off research projects [3] nor about their source code [57]. While DWP has consulted the researchers of this project and asked us for updates on our findings in the form of reports, they did not agree to formal interviews about how the system works. Conducting research that can account for the experiences of people who claim Universal Credit is particularly crucial given DWP’s lack of transparency about how they study and understand the user experience. As will be shown later through the use of screenshots, our research gained insight into the interac-tion between claimants and social security agents, a largely unseen aspect of social security.In the following sections, we demonstrate how ALL methods focused on users of ADMS can be a powerful approach to collect data about systems, such as UC, that are highly complex and pose problems of access. [...] The data presented in this paper is from an ongoing qualitative, lon-gitudinal panel study conducted as part of a larger project exploring the lived experiences of recipients of UC.Our panel study commenced in mid-2022 and is expected to run until the end of 2023; this paper reports on data collected in the first six-month period of the study from participants who were recruited in 2022. The study applies two distinct methods of qualitative data collection for each participant: 1. semi-structured interviews and2. bi-weekly prompted updates sent over phone text asking about participants' interactions with UC.We recruited twenty-six participants through local charities by participating in their in-person events and by advertising the study their social media and mailing lists. Participants take part in the study over six or twelve months and were interviewed at the beginning of this period as well as after six months. Participants also receive text message prompts from the researchers roughly every two weeks asking for any updates on their interactions with UC. Participants used different methods to convey information: sending messages and sometimes screenshots of their interactions and accounts. Five participants at some point phoned the researchers to explain their situation rather than text. If asked for advice, researchers pointed participants to their case managers, work coachesand a local advice charity. The exception was a participant who had significant financial troubles, and the researchers believed that the participants’ children were at serious risk. On this occasion the researchers recommended a specific financial aid the participant could apply for.We gave participants a £25 shopping voucher after their first interview and a second one for a second interview at the six-month period to reimburse them for their time. The first interviews with each participant lasted for approximately forty-five minutes and were conducted either online or in person at local charity offices,cafés or at the University of Edinburgh. Follow up interviews lasted 15-30 minutes. The four participants whose quotes are used below reviewed and consented to their quotations and the representation of their stories.Data collection for this study was not without challenges. Twoparticipants never responded to the prompts and were eventually removed from the study. Twenty-one respondents provided us with relevant data about their interactions with Universal Credit; the rest,despite replying to prompts, either did not share any information that was related to the study or did not experience any problems with US during the first six months.We refer to our participants by pseudonyms. As some of our data was based on text messages and screenshots from our participants,quotes from these data sources often contain incorrect spelling or grammar. In order to preserve the original voice of our partici-pants, we kept these as they were, unless changes were crucial for intelligibility.The results of our study cannot be interpreted without taking the limitations of this study into consideration. Firstly, as is often the case with qualitative research, our sample was not representative,so the findings are not generalizable. Secondly, the language of the interviews and data collection in general was English; therefore,our study only includes participants who were able to speak inEnglish at least on a conversational level. Thirdly, our sample has a high number of participants who identify as female, thus, the view of male and non-binary participants are less pronounced in our dataset.Researchers received ethics approval for the study from theUniversity of Edinburgh.

A report by Human Rights Watch [72] uses the metaphor of a camera to describe how STI affects the UC monthly assessment period:If the RTI system is a camera, the assessment period functions like a timer that tells it when to take a photo.The resulting snapshot is the earnings data that Universal Credit’s algorithm uses to calculate an individ-ual’s benefit payment for that month.UC considers all income that is reported to HMRC for self-reported by the claimant to UC during each monthly assessment period,and the UC payment decreases accordingly. After the monthly assessment of earnings, most claimants in the UK receive their payment once a month. In Scotland, people can choose to receive their monthly pay in two, approximately bi-weekly instalments.One goal of UC’s month-to-month calculation, based on actual earnings, is to eliminate some of the problems claimants faced withUK’s legacy social security systems. A previous benefit, WorkingTax Credits, had based claimants’ monthly payment on an average of earnings from the past year as reported to HMRC, and this aver-age could over- or under-estimated the benefit owed if a claimant's earnings changed. The discrepancies in reported versus actual earn-ings led claimants into debt to DWP if their earnings fell and rose but their tax credit payment stayed the same. UC aims to eliminate over- or under-payments to claimants – and falling into arrears toDWP – and reduce the burden on claimants to report changes in earnings [49]. DWP publishes very little documentation about UC’s perfor-mance data, “despite the evidence that the Universal Credit team have built up a modern analytics capability where real-time data would be the expectation” [57] (p.70). Likewise, it does not publish any public domain data about its digital services, with the exception of blog and a smattering of one-off research projects [3] nor about their source code [57]. While DWP has consulted the researchers of this project and asked us for updates on our findings in the form of reports, they did not agree to formal interviews about how the system works. Conducting research that can account for the experiences of people who claim Universal Credit is particularly crucial given DWP’s lack of transparency about how they study and understand the user experience. As will be shown later through the use of screenshots, our research gained insight into the interac-tion between claimants and social security agents, a largely unseen aspect of social security.In the following sections, we demonstrate how ALL methods focused on users of ADMS can be a powerful approach to collect data about systems, such as UC, that are highly complex and pose problems of access. [...] The data presented in this paper is from an ongoing qualitative, lon-gitudinal panel study conducted as part of a larger project exploring the lived experiences of recipients of UC.Our panel study commenced in mid-2022 and is expected to run until the end of 2023; this paper reports on data collected in the first six-month period of the study from participants who were recruited in 2022. The study applies two distinct methods of qualitative data collection for each participant: 1. semi-structured interviews and2. bi-weekly prompted updates sent over phone text asking about participants' interactions with UC.We recruited twenty-six participants through local charities by participating in their in-person events and by advertising the study their social media and mailing lists. Participants take part in the study over six or twelve months and were interviewed at the beginning of this period as well as after six months. Participants also receive text message prompts from the researchers roughly every two weeks asking for any updates on their interactions with UC. Participants used different methods to convey information: sending messages and sometimes screenshots of their interactions and accounts. Five participants at some point phoned the researchers to explain their situation rather than text. If asked for advice, researchers pointed participants to their case managers, work coachesand a local advice charity. The exception was a participant who had significant financial troubles, and the researchers believed that the participants’ children were at serious risk. On this occasion the researchers recommended a specific financial aid the participant could apply for.We gave participants a £25 shopping voucher after their first interview and a second one for a second interview at the six-month period to reimburse them for their time. The first interviews with each participant lasted for approximately forty-five minutes and were conducted either online or in person at local charity offices,cafés or at the University of Edinburgh. Follow up interviews lasted 15-30 minutes. The four participants whose quotes are used below reviewed and consented to their quotations and the representation of their stories.Data collection for this study was not without challenges. Twoparticipants never responded to the prompts and were eventually removed from the study. Twenty-one respondents provided us with relevant data about their interactions with Universal Credit; the rest,despite replying to prompts, either did not share any information that was related to the study or did not experience any problems with US during the first six months.We refer to our participants by pseudonyms. As some of our data was based on text messages and screenshots from our participants,quotes from these data sources often contain incorrect spelling or grammar. In order to preserve the original voice of our partici-pants, we kept these as they were, unless changes were crucial for intelligibility.The results of our study cannot be interpreted without taking the limitations of this study into consideration. Firstly, as is often the case with qualitative research, our sample was not representative,so the findings are not generalizable. Secondly, the language of the interviews and data collection in general was English; therefore,our study only includes participants who were able to speak inEnglish at least on a conversational level. Thirdly, our sample has a high number of participants who identify as female, thus, the view of male and non-binary participants are less pronounced in our dataset.Researchers received ethics approval for the study from theUniversity of Edinburgh. [...] The RTI to UC data pipeline, as mentioned, entails the flow of data from claimants’ employers to HMRC, where it becomes aggregated in its Real Time Information system. Though the data is collected for tax purposes, HMRC shares this data with UC daily, and UC uses it to adjust claimants’ monthly UC payment.As is the case with many vital infrastructures when they breakdown [69], the pipeline became most visible to claimants when errors were made at some point in these data exchange processes. RTI error rates are endemic to the system. The UK’s National AuditOffice (NAO) reported in 2018 that UC is “sensitive to any change in claimants’ monthly income” and “employers sometimes supply information [to RTI] that is late or which contains errors”[54](p.61). NAO estimated that in 2017-18, UC made overpayment of 7.2 percent and underpayments of 1.3 percent in part for this reason. [54] A result of these errors are fluctuations in claimants pay, making it difficult to budget and plan.Participants’ accounts detail the steps they took to rectify the errors. In some cases, claimants contacted their employer and UCto report the error, but they then had little agency over the timing of its correction. The only data seen as relevant by UC to rectifying the pay calculation is the HMRC RTI data, not any evidence offered by the claimant.Gaja, a white Polish woman in her late 40s raising two children,experienced an RTI error during the course of the study. In her first interview in June 2022, she described her case as relatively simple,telling us, “for me personally it works great,” even though working at a charity as a case worker she had seen problems with the paycalculation affecting her clients.In October 2022 Gaja reported over a text that she had received more payment from UC than anticipated and assumed her earnings had not been reported to HMRC, resulting in larger-than-usual UCentitlement; she wrote, “Something was not reported to [HMRC]and I told them [UC] that my award is too high, but, they can’t do anything about it, need to wait for hmrc information.”Gaja was not worried about budgeting but understood such mistakes could pose problems for others:I’ve got far too much money that I need to return [toUC], not really changing anything if you are aware of the mistake, this could be a different story if I wouldn't understand how they work and spend all the money.She pursued the matter with UC, then told us in early November,“they [UC] are still waiting for my employer to send the report sofar no news.” By late November she was still waiting for an update on the case.When we interviewed Gaja a second time in January, she told us that HMRC had finally reported the September earnings two months later in December, and the overpayment from UC wouldnow be deducted automatically from her future UC payments. Heremployer told GaJa they had reported the earnings on time, so she never received an explanation for the delay and assumed that the mistake was due to her holding two jobs, and that HMRC had notregistered the wages for one. Gaja shared that she did not feel she could affect or speed up the process:I’ve informed universal credit that this will be a mis-take in payment. But they didn’t ask me about my wage slip or anything like that, they just said that it will clear up when they clear up because they need to listen to HMRC and not what I’m going to say.Gaja told us she was satisfied with how the situation was resolved and still much preferred UC, with its month-to-month calculations,to the older system used by Tax Credits, based on retrospective earnings data that so often led to overpayments and debt.Another participant in our study expressed more distress when she found an RTI error. Emily, who identifies as Black Caribbeanand white, is a single mother of two children in her late thirties. Sheworks as an administrator for a center that provides a safe place for children to meet parents they do not live with. In her first interview she was very unhappy with Universal Credit, highlighting that in the approximately three years she had been receiving it, she never felt supported and had received conflicting and wrong information [...] on her case from case workers and work coaches. She had also encountered difficulties reclaiming childcare costs.In mid-January 2023, Emily shared over a text that her employer made an error reporting her salary in November 2022, and as a result she received £300 less in her January payment than she was entitled to. Emily wrote, “I know the whole system [. . . ] is an absolute shambles. They are causing more hardship, it’s a horrible situation.” Emily shared screenshots of her exchange with her UC case manager after she reported the error in December. Her case manager told her that they would not be able to take action until January – UC needed to wait for confirmation from HMRC, which,in turn, needed a report from Emily’s employer. At the end ofDecember, she wrote to her case manager: “There is surely another way to rectify this so that I am not in financial crisis again. This is now adding to my mental health as I am not sleeping worrying.”(See Fig. 1)By mid-January Emily was distraught, texting us, “So I’m cur-rently waiting for that dispute to be resolved as I am once again out of pocket and struggling because of an error.”When we checked in at the end of January, Emily let us know,happily, that the error has been fixed thanks to her employer’s swift response: “My employer were very helpful and contacted HMRC atspeed and UC put the difference into my account on Friday. [. . . ]My work has been amazing, thankfully.”Despite this, Emily had experienced difficulties during this two-month period of uncertainty, writing, “Just frustrating [that] I had to get an advance on my wage from my work to survive. In addition to RTI-related errors, UC’s dynamic monthly payment presents another challenge for some working claimants. Noted previously by the Child Poverty Action Group [14] and Human RightsWatch [72], a punitive discrepancy can occur when a claimant's monthly assessment period, which reflects the amount of earnings a person receives within its time frame, is not in alignment with the period of work covered by the earnings. For most claimants,particularly those paid monthly, the UC assessment period will not pose problems. However, according to DWP’s own analysis,around 25 percent of claimants will find their benefits reduced because they are paid every two or four weeks. People who are not paid monthly but rather every two or four weeks will encounter certain assessment periods over the course of a year that captures two payments at once, one at the beginning and one at the end of the period. For instance, someone who receives their wage every four weeks will receive two sets of wages in one assessment pe-riod, roughly once every 13 months, and may receive reduced or no UC payment following this. DWP, well aware of this problem,calls these dual temporalities “different earning patterns” in their guidance on their official website. We detail what two users revealabout UC by interrogating the effects of the fixed assessment period on their payment.Fiona, a white Scottish woman, is a single mother in her late thirties with two children. She works as a cleaner for a school that pays her every four weeks. In her first interview she told us she was experiencing significant difficulties understanding the UC payment calculation and anticipating her monthly payment. At the beginning of August – six weeks after her first interview – she reported that she was trying to get information from UC, both through her online account and the phone helpline, regarding her entitlement. Fiona worried that, due to being paid every four weeks, she would not gether entitlement in an upcoming month. She wrote to us via text, “Itried phone uc to be told [to] write my worries and questions online,so i have done this yesterday and waiting on response.” Knowing Far in advance whether she would get her entitlement especially mattered as her children are “not entitled to school meals so [she would] need to make sure [her] kids have lunch money”.Throughout August, September and October we received fre-quent, instant updates from Fiona on her interactions with differentUC case workers as she tried to understand when she would not receive a UC payment. Fiona’s updates included screenshots of messages she exchanged with case managers and phone calls elab-orating her worries and confusion. (See Fig. 2)At the end of September, Fiona shared that she still had not received a definitive answer regarding the month she would not receive UC payment: “I don’t know if it will be november or decem-ber or both i don’t get paid , it’s horrible.” In October she wrote,“the system is hellish”.She finally learned she would not receive UC payment in No-vember from her UC statement that month, sent only a few days before her payment would have been put in her bank account. Shewrote over text, “I’m not getting a november pay it’s come up £0 no one told me.”Throughout, she interacted with several different case managers.In our second interview in mid-January 2023, she told us how frus-trating and impersonal these interactions were: “Even [just] the same person replying to me would be better than a half assed con-versation.” She described her experience during the previous three months, saying, “I keep emailing them and writing, ‘Good after-noon, could someone help me understand the calculation behind this madness?’.” She shared that she had borrowed money from her son to “to keep [her] head above water until [she] get[s] paid.”Conflicts between employers’ payment policies and the UC as-sessment period can happen as people start new jobs or change their working hours. Jennifer, a white Scottish woman, is a single mother of two children in her early thirties who worked 16 hours a week as a family support worker when we first interviewed her inJune 2022. Overall, Jennifer seemed content with UC, though she had once experienced a mix-up with her wage-reporting that she said had been quickly resolved.In July she left her job due to mental health difficulties. UC required her to look for 25 hours of work to qualify for the benefit,and by October she found a 16 hour-a-week contract serving school dinners. She worried this change in employment would affect UCs automated payment since her new employer had not yet paid her first wages for the month of October. In mid-October she sent a text to say she feared she would receive no UC payment the fol-lowing month: “If [my wage payment] doesn’t fall into the window that [UC] create. 21 to 21st of each month I wont receive any payment.” If she was paid for her October hours and November Hours in the same month, then her combined earnings could put her over the threshold to qualify for UC, resulting in no UC payment in November.When we interviewed Jennifer again in January, she informed us that, indeed, her employer’s late October pay had resulted ina “dip” in UC – though her November payment “wasn’t zero, no,it just wasn’t as high as what [she] thought”. She expressed her frustration with UC’s rigid assessment period and how it accounts for when you are paid according to HMRC, but not the period you actually worked I’d waited a long time for my first wage so it looks like they had paid me twice. [. . . ] They put it in the same month so it looked like I got more which is a really frustrating part of universal credit.Jennifer also partly blamed herself for her changing circumstances;she had quit the school dinner post in early December to take another job in January as a pupil support assistant – a position she was excited about and felt more qualified for – for 25 hours a week.Reflecting on her two jobs Jennifer told us, “It is partly my fault, Ihave leapt from job to job in such a short amount of time.",1103-8,Employers report their employees’ earnings using payroll software
25,UCClaimants,hasProducedArtifact,DataOnUCExperience,"we draw on an ongoing, empirical study examining Universal Credit (UC), an automated social security payment used in the United Kingdom. UC uses a dynamic, means-testing payment calculation to determine the monthly amount of claim people are entitled to. In this study we use serial interviews plus phone texts as prompts for solicit-ing feedback from users. We argue that ALL provides a unique opportunity to gather information on ADMS, both over time and in situ. Capturing information over time allows for more granular accounts of dynamic trajectories. Through the personal accounts of users reacting in situ, QLR also gives researchers insight into the emotional dimensions of users’ interactions with ADMS.In the following literature review, we cover the challenges schol-ars have confronted while studying ADMS, how scholars have studied users of ADMS to overcome these challenges, and the value and drawbacks of longitudinal research. [...] Administered by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP),Universal Credit is the UK’s largest social security payment. DWPintroduced UC in 2012, and it is set to replace some of the previ-ous benefits by 2024. The DWP terms UC ‘digital-by-default’ [27] since recipients apply for and receive payments through an online account. The account also acts as the primary mode of communica-tion with DWP staff (though people unable to maintain the online account can opt to interact solely by phone). UC is a means-tested and conditional benefit; to qualify, some claimants must work or look for work for a certain number of hours per week, based on their capability to work and certain life circumstances, such as having dependents.This study focuses on an essential automated decision-making feature of UC: its dynamic payment algorithm. UC uses automation to determine the amount of money claimants receive each month,based on calculating data points collected during a prior monthly assessment period. The monthly assessment period is a personal-ized unit of time based on the day a person applied for the benefit –for instance, if a person applies on February 15th, their assessment period will be from the 15th of a given month until the 14th of the next month. Claimants’ start with a ‘minimum standard allowance based on their age and relationship status (either single or living with a partner) and other factors such as disability or number of dependents. Payments will then be adjusted negatively depending on monthly earnings and deductions. Deductions include repayments for advance claims the claimant may have been granted in the past,past overpayments from UC and third-party deductions made at the request of a creditor, including rent arrears, utility arrears, Council Tax bill arrears, child support maintenance and fines by UC.For those working, the adjustments to UC based on monthly earnings happen automatically through a data exchange with theHMRC’s (HM Revenue and Customs) Real Time Information (RTI)system. Employers report their employees’ earnings using payroll software to RTI for tax purposes, and DWP accesses this stream of data daily. A report by Human Rights Watch [72] uses the metaphor of a camera to describe how STI affects the UC monthly assessment period:If the RTI system is a camera, the assessment period functions like a timer that tells it when to take a photo.The resulting snapshot is the earnings data that Universal Credit’s algorithm uses to calculate an individ-ual’s benefit payment for that month.UC considers all income that is reported to HMRC for self-reported by the claimant to UC during each monthly assessment period,and the UC payment decreases accordingly. After the monthly assessment of earnings, most claimants in the UK receive their payment once a month. In Scotland, people can choose to receive their monthly pay in two, approximately bi-weekly instalments.One goal of UC’s month-to-month calculation, based on actual earnings, is to eliminate some of the problems claimants faced withUK’s legacy social security systems.

The discrepancies in reported versus actual earn-ings led claimants into debt to DWP if their earnings fell and rose but their tax credit payment stayed the same. UC aims to eliminate over- or under-payments to claimants – and falling into arrears toDWP – and reduce the burden on claimants to report changes in earnings [49]. DWP publishes very little documentation about UC’s perfor-mance data, “despite the evidence that the Universal Credit team have built up a modern analytics capability where real-time data would be the expectation” [57] (p.70). Likewise, it does not publish any public domain data about its digital services, with the exception of blog and a smattering of one-off research projects [3] nor about their source code [57].

Shewrote over text, “I’m not getting a november pay it’s come up £0 no one told me.”Throughout, she interacted with several different case managers.In our second interview in mid-January 2023, she told us how frus-trating and impersonal these interactions were: “Even [just] the same person replying to me would be better than a half assed con-versation.” She described her experience during the previous three months, saying, “I keep emailing them and writing, ‘Good after-noon, could someone help me understand the calculation behind this madness?’.” She shared that she had borrowed money from her son to “to keep [her] head above water until [she] get[s] paid.”Conflicts between employers’ payment policies and the UC as-sessment period can happen as people start new jobs or change their working hours. Jennifer, a white Scottish woman, is a single mother of two children in her early thirties who worked 16 hours a week as a family support worker when we first interviewed her inJune 2022. Overall, Jennifer seemed content with UC, though she had once experienced a mix-up with her wage-reporting that she said had been quickly resolved.In July she left her job due to mental health difficulties. UC required her to look for 25 hours of work to qualify for the benefit,and by October she found a 16 hour-a-week contract serving school dinners. She worried this change in employment would affect UCs automated payment since her new employer had not yet paid her first wages for the month of October. In mid-October she sent a text to say she feared she would receive no UC payment the fol-lowing month: “If [my wage payment] doesn’t fall into the window that [UC] create. 21 to 21st of each month I wont receive any payment.” If she was paid for her October hours and November Hours in the same month, then her combined earnings could put her over the threshold to qualify for UC, resulting in no UC payment in November.When we interviewed Jennifer again in January, she informed us that, indeed, her employer’s late October pay had resulted ina “dip” in UC – though her November payment “wasn’t zero, no,it just wasn’t as high as what [she] thought”. She expressed her frustration with UC’s rigid assessment period and how it accounts for when you are paid according to HMRC, but not the period you actually worked I’d waited a long time for my first wage so it looks like they had paid me twice. [. . . ] They put it in the same month so it looked like I got more which is a really frustrating part of universal credit.Jennifer also partly blamed herself for her changing circumstances;she had quit the school dinner post in early December to take another job in January as a pupil support assistant – a position she was excited about and felt more qualified for – for 25 hours a week.Reflecting on her two jobs Jennifer told us, “It is partly my fault, Ihave leapt from job to job in such a short amount of time.",1103-8,The study applies two distinct methods of qualitative data collection for each participant: 1. semi-structured interviews and2. bi-weekly prompted updates sent over phone text asking about participants' interactions with UC.
26,UniversalCredit,reflectsPrecept,Errors,"we draw on an ongoing, empirical study examining Universal Credit (UC), an automated social security payment used in the United Kingdom. UC uses a dynamic, means-testing payment calculation to determine the monthly amount of claim people are entitled to. In this study we use serial interviews plus phone texts as prompts for solicit-ing feedback from users. We argue that ALL provides a unique opportunity to gather information on ADMS, both over time and in situ. Capturing information over time allows for more granular accounts of dynamic trajectories. Through the personal accounts of users reacting in situ, QLR also gives researchers insight into the emotional dimensions of users’ interactions with ADMS.In the following literature review, we cover the challenges schol-ars have confronted while studying ADMS, how scholars have studied users of ADMS to overcome these challenges, and the value and drawbacks of longitudinal research. [...] Administered by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP),Universal Credit is the UK’s largest social security payment. DWPintroduced UC in 2012, and it is set to replace some of the previ-ous benefits by 2024. The DWP terms UC ‘digital-by-default’ [27] since recipients apply for and receive payments through an online account. The account also acts as the primary mode of communica-tion with DWP staff (though people unable to maintain the online account can opt to interact solely by phone). UC is a means-tested and conditional benefit; to qualify, some claimants must work or look for work for a certain number of hours per week, based on their capability to work and certain life circumstances, such as having dependents.This study focuses on an essential automated decision-making feature of UC: its dynamic payment algorithm. UC uses automation to determine the amount of money claimants receive each month,based on calculating data points collected during a prior monthly assessment period. The monthly assessment period is a personal-ized unit of time based on the day a person applied for the benefit –for instance, if a person applies on February 15th, their assessment period will be from the 15th of a given month until the 14th of the next month. Claimants’ start with a ‘minimum standard allowance based on their age and relationship status (either single or living with a partner) and other factors such as disability or number of dependents. Payments will then be adjusted negatively depending on monthly earnings and deductions. Deductions include repayments for advance claims the claimant may have been granted in the past,past overpayments from UC and third-party deductions made at the request of a creditor, including rent arrears, utility arrears, Council Tax bill arrears, child support maintenance and fines by UC.For those working, the adjustments to UC based on monthly earnings happen automatically through a data exchange with theHMRC’s (HM Revenue and Customs) Real Time Information (RTI)system. Employers report their employees’ earnings using payroll software to RTI for tax purposes, and DWP accesses this stream of data daily. A report by Human Rights Watch [72] uses the metaphor of a camera to describe how STI affects the UC monthly assessment period:If the RTI system is a camera, the assessment period functions like a timer that tells it when to take a photo.The resulting snapshot is the earnings data that Universal Credit’s algorithm uses to calculate an individ-ual’s benefit payment for that month.UC considers all income that is reported to HMRC for self-reported by the claimant to UC during each monthly assessment period,and the UC payment decreases accordingly. After the monthly assessment of earnings, most claimants in the UK receive their payment once a month. In Scotland, people can choose to receive their monthly pay in two, approximately bi-weekly instalments.One goal of UC’s month-to-month calculation, based on actual earnings, is to eliminate some of the problems claimants faced withUK’s legacy social security systems. A previous benefit, WorkingTax Credits, had based claimants’ monthly payment on an average of earnings from the past year as reported to HMRC, and this aver-age could over- or under-estimated the benefit owed if a claimant's earnings changed. The discrepancies in reported versus actual earn-ings led claimants into debt to DWP if their earnings fell and rose but their tax credit payment stayed the same. UC aims to eliminate over- or under-payments to claimants – and falling into arrears toDWP – and reduce the burden on claimants to report changes in earnings [49]. DWP publishes very little documentation about UC’s perfor-mance data, “despite the evidence that the Universal Credit team have built up a modern analytics capability where real-time data would be the expectation” [57] (p.70). Likewise, it does not publish any public domain data about its digital services, with the exception of blog and a smattering of one-off research projects [3] nor about their source code [57]. While DWP has consulted the researchers of this project and asked us for updates on our findings in the form of reports, they did not agree to formal interviews about how the system works. Conducting research that can account for the experiences of people who claim Universal Credit is particularly crucial given DWP’s lack of transparency about how they study and understand the user experience. As will be shown later through the use of screenshots, our research gained insight into the interac-tion between claimants and social security agents, a largely unseen aspect of social security.In the following sections, we demonstrate how ALL methods focused on users of ADMS can be a powerful approach to collect data about systems, such as UC, that are highly complex and pose problems of access. [...] The data presented in this paper is from an ongoing qualitative, lon-gitudinal panel study conducted as part of a larger project exploring the lived experiences of recipients of UC.Our panel study commenced in mid-2022 and is expected to run until the end of 2023; this paper reports on data collected in the first six-month period of the study from participants who were recruited in 2022. The study applies two distinct methods of qualitative data collection for each participant: 1. semi-structured interviews and2. bi-weekly prompted updates sent over phone text asking about participants' interactions with UC.We recruited twenty-six participants through local charities by participating in their in-person events and by advertising the study their social media and mailing lists. Participants take part in the study over six or twelve months and were interviewed at the beginning of this period as well as after six months. Participants also receive text message prompts from the researchers roughly every two weeks asking for any updates on their interactions with UC. Participants used different methods to convey information: sending messages and sometimes screenshots of their interactions and accounts. Five participants at some point phoned the researchers to explain their situation rather than text. If asked for advice, researchers pointed participants to their case managers, work coachesand a local advice charity. The exception was a participant who had significant financial troubles, and the researchers believed that the participants’ children were at serious risk. On this occasion the researchers recommended a specific financial aid the participant could apply for.We gave participants a £25 shopping voucher after their first interview and a second one for a second interview at the six-month period to reimburse them for their time. The first interviews with each participant lasted for approximately forty-five minutes and were conducted either online or in person at local charity offices,cafés or at the University of Edinburgh. Follow up interviews lasted 15-30 minutes. The four participants whose quotes are used below reviewed and consented to their quotations and the representation of their stories.Data collection for this study was not without challenges. Twoparticipants never responded to the prompts and were eventually removed from the study. Twenty-one respondents provided us with relevant data about their interactions with Universal Credit; the rest,despite replying to prompts, either did not share any information that was related to the study or did not experience any problems with US during the first six months.We refer to our participants by pseudonyms. As some of our data was based on text messages and screenshots from our participants,quotes from these data sources often contain incorrect spelling or grammar. In order to preserve the original voice of our partici-pants, we kept these as they were, unless changes were crucial for intelligibility.The results of our study cannot be interpreted without taking the limitations of this study into consideration. Firstly, as is often the case with qualitative research, our sample was not representative,so the findings are not generalizable. Secondly, the language of the interviews and data collection in general was English; therefore,our study only includes participants who were able to speak inEnglish at least on a conversational level. Thirdly, our sample has a high number of participants who identify as female, thus, the view of male and non-binary participants are less pronounced in our dataset.Researchers received ethics approval for the study from theUniversity of Edinburgh. [...] The RTI to UC data pipeline, as mentioned, entails the flow of data from claimants’ employers to HMRC, where it becomes aggregated in its Real Time Information system. Though the data is collected for tax purposes, HMRC shares this data with UC daily, and UC uses it to adjust claimants’ monthly UC payment.As is the case with many vital infrastructures when they breakdown [69], the pipeline became most visible to claimants when errors were made at some point in these data exchange processes. RTI error rates are endemic to the system. The UK’s National AuditOffice (NAO) reported in 2018 that UC is “sensitive to any change in claimants’ monthly income” and “employers sometimes supply information [to RTI] that is late or which contains errors”[54](p.61). NAO estimated that in 2017-18, UC made overpayment of 7.2 percent and underpayments of 1.3 percent in part for this reason. [54] A result of these errors are fluctuations in claimants pay, making it difficult to budget and plan.Participants’ accounts detail the steps they took to rectify the errors. In some cases, claimants contacted their employer and UCto report the error, but they then had little agency over the timing of its correction. The only data seen as relevant by UC to rectifying the pay calculation is the HMRC RTI data, not any evidence offered by the claimant.Gaja, a white Polish woman in her late 40s raising two children,experienced an RTI error during the course of the study. In her first interview in June 2022, she described her case as relatively simple,telling us, “for me personally it works great,” even though working at a charity as a case worker she had seen problems with the paycalculation affecting her clients.In October 2022 Gaja reported over a text that she had received more payment from UC than anticipated and assumed her earnings had not been reported to HMRC, resulting in larger-than-usual UCentitlement; she wrote, “Something was not reported to [HMRC]and I told them [UC] that my award is too high, but, they can’t do anything about it, need to wait for hmrc information.”Gaja was not worried about budgeting but understood such mistakes could pose problems for others:I’ve got far too much money that I need to return [toUC], not really changing anything if you are aware of the mistake, this could be a different story if I wouldn't understand how they work and spend all the money.She pursued the matter with UC, then told us in early November,“they [UC] are still waiting for my employer to send the report sofar no news.” By late November she was still waiting for an update on the case.When we interviewed Gaja a second time in January, she told us that HMRC had finally reported the September earnings two months later in December, and the overpayment from UC wouldnow be deducted automatically from her future UC payments. Heremployer told GaJa they had reported the earnings on time, so she never received an explanation for the delay and assumed that the mistake was due to her holding two jobs, and that HMRC had notregistered the wages for one. Gaja shared that she did not feel she could affect or speed up the process:I’ve informed universal credit that this will be a mis-take in payment. But they didn’t ask me about my wage slip or anything like that, they just said that it will clear up when they clear up because they need to listen to HMRC and not what I’m going to say.Gaja told us she was satisfied with how the situation was resolved and still much preferred UC, with its month-to-month calculations,to the older system used by Tax Credits, based on retrospective earnings data that so often led to overpayments and debt.Another participant in our study expressed more distress when she found an RTI error. Emily, who identifies as Black Caribbeanand white, is a single mother of two children in her late thirties. Sheworks as an administrator for a center that provides a safe place for children to meet parents they do not live with. In her first interview she was very unhappy with Universal Credit, highlighting that in the approximately three years she had been receiving it, she never felt supported and had received conflicting and wrong information [...] on her case from case workers and work coaches. She had also encountered difficulties reclaiming childcare costs.In mid-January 2023, Emily shared over a text that her employer made an error reporting her salary in November 2022, and as a result she received £300 less in her January payment than she was entitled to. Emily wrote, “I know the whole system [. . . ] is an absolute shambles. They are causing more hardship, it’s a horrible situation.” Emily shared screenshots of her exchange with her UC case manager after she reported the error in December. Her case manager told her that they would not be able to take action until January – UC needed to wait for confirmation from HMRC, which,in turn, needed a report from Emily’s employer. At the end ofDecember, she wrote to her case manager: “There is surely another way to rectify this so that I am not in financial crisis again. This is now adding to my mental health as I am not sleeping worrying.”(See Fig. 1)By mid-January Emily was distraught, texting us, “So I’m cur-rently waiting for that dispute to be resolved as I am once again out of pocket and struggling because of an error.”When we checked in at the end of January, Emily let us know,happily, that the error has been fixed thanks to her employer’s swift response: “My employer were very helpful and contacted HMRC atspeed and UC put the difference into my account on Friday. [. . . ]My work has been amazing, thankfully.”Despite this, Emily had experienced difficulties during this two-month period of uncertainty, writing, “Just frustrating [that] I had to get an advance on my wage from my work to survive. In addition to RTI-related errors, UC’s dynamic monthly payment presents another challenge for some working claimants. Noted previously by the Child Poverty Action Group [14] and Human RightsWatch [72], a punitive discrepancy can occur when a claimant's monthly assessment period, which reflects the amount of earnings a person receives within its time frame, is not in alignment with the period of work covered by the earnings. For most claimants,particularly those paid monthly, the UC assessment period will not pose problems. However, according to DWP’s own analysis,around 25 percent of claimants will find their benefits reduced because they are paid every two or four weeks. People who are not paid monthly but rather every two or four weeks will encounter certain assessment periods over the course of a year that captures two payments at once, one at the beginning and one at the end of the period. For instance, someone who receives their wage every four weeks will receive two sets of wages in one assessment pe-riod, roughly once every 13 months, and may receive reduced or no UC payment following this. DWP, well aware of this problem,calls these dual temporalities “different earning patterns” in their guidance on their official website. We detail what two users revealabout UC by interrogating the effects of the fixed assessment period on their payment.Fiona, a white Scottish woman, is a single mother in her late thirties with two children. She works as a cleaner for a school that pays her every four weeks. In her first interview she told us she was experiencing significant difficulties understanding the UC payment calculation and anticipating her monthly payment. At the beginning of August – six weeks after her first interview – she reported that she was trying to get information from UC, both through her online account and the phone helpline, regarding her entitlement. Fiona worried that, due to being paid every four weeks, she would not gether entitlement in an upcoming month. She wrote to us via text, “Itried phone uc to be told [to] write my worries and questions online,so i have done this yesterday and waiting on response.” Knowing Far in advance whether she would get her entitlement especially mattered as her children are “not entitled to school meals so [she would] need to make sure [her] kids have lunch money”.Throughout August, September and October we received fre-quent, instant updates from Fiona on her interactions with differentUC case workers as she tried to understand when she would not receive a UC payment. Fiona’s updates included screenshots of messages she exchanged with case managers and phone calls elab-orating her worries and confusion. (See Fig. 2)At the end of September, Fiona shared that she still had not received a definitive answer regarding the month she would not receive UC payment: “I don’t know if it will be november or decem-ber or both i don’t get paid , it’s horrible.” In October she wrote,“the system is hellish”.She finally learned she would not receive UC payment in No-vember from her UC statement that month, sent only a few days before her payment would have been put in her bank account. Shewrote over text, “I’m not getting a november pay it’s come up £0 no one told me.”Throughout, she interacted with several different case managers.In our second interview in mid-January 2023, she told us how frus-trating and impersonal these interactions were: “Even [just] the same person replying to me would be better than a half assed con-versation.” She described her experience during the previous three months, saying, “I keep emailing them and writing, ‘Good after-noon, could someone help me understand the calculation behind this madness?’.” She shared that she had borrowed money from her son to “to keep [her] head above water until [she] get[s] paid.”Conflicts between employers’ payment policies and the UC as-sessment period can happen as people start new jobs or change their working hours. Jennifer, a white Scottish woman, is a single mother of two children in her early thirties who worked 16 hours a week as a family support worker when we first interviewed her inJune 2022.

Gaja shared that she did not feel she could affect or speed up the process:I’ve informed universal credit that this will be a mis-take in payment. But they didn’t ask me about my wage slip or anything like that, they just said that it will clear up when they clear up because they need to listen to HMRC and not what I’m going to say.Gaja told us she was satisfied with how the situation was resolved and still much preferred UC, with its month-to-month calculations,to the older system used by Tax Credits, based on retrospective earnings data that so often led to overpayments and debt.Another participant in our study expressed more distress when she found an RTI error. Emily, who identifies as Black Caribbeanand white, is a single mother of two children in her late thirties. Sheworks as an administrator for a center that provides a safe place for children to meet parents they do not live with. In her first interview she was very unhappy with Universal Credit, highlighting that in the approximately three years she had been receiving it, she never felt supported and had received conflicting and wrong information [...] on her case from case workers and work coaches. She had also encountered difficulties reclaiming childcare costs.In mid-January 2023, Emily shared over a text that her employer made an error reporting her salary in November 2022, and as a result she received £300 less in her January payment than she was entitled to. Emily wrote, “I know the whole system [. . . ] is an absolute shambles. They are causing more hardship, it’s a horrible situation.” Emily shared screenshots of her exchange with her UC case manager after she reported the error in December. Her case manager told her that they would not be able to take action until January – UC needed to wait for confirmation from HMRC, which,in turn, needed a report from Emily’s employer. At the end ofDecember, she wrote to her case manager: “There is surely another way to rectify this so that I am not in financial crisis again. This is now adding to my mental health as I am not sleeping worrying.”(See Fig. 1)By mid-January Emily was distraught, texting us, “So I’m cur-rently waiting for that dispute to be resolved as I am once again out of pocket and struggling because of an error.”When we checked in at the end of January, Emily let us know,happily, that the error has been fixed thanks to her employer’s swift response: “My employer were very helpful and contacted HMRC atspeed and UC put the difference into my account on Friday. [. . . ]My work has been amazing, thankfully.”Despite this, Emily had experienced difficulties during this two-month period of uncertainty, writing, “Just frustrating [that] I had to get an advance on my wage from my work to survive. In addition to RTI-related errors, UC’s dynamic monthly payment presents another challenge for some working claimants. Noted previously by the Child Poverty Action Group [14] and Human RightsWatch [72], a punitive discrepancy can occur when a claimant's monthly assessment period, which reflects the amount of earnings a person receives within its time frame, is not in alignment with the period of work covered by the earnings. For most claimants,particularly those paid monthly, the UC assessment period will not pose problems. However, according to DWP’s own analysis,around 25 percent of claimants will find their benefits reduced because they are paid every two or four weeks. People who are not paid monthly but rather every two or four weeks will encounter certain assessment periods over the course of a year that captures two payments at once, one at the beginning and one at the end of the period. For instance, someone who receives their wage every four weeks will receive two sets of wages in one assessment pe-riod, roughly once every 13 months, and may receive reduced or no UC payment following this. DWP, well aware of this problem,calls these dual temporalities “different earning patterns” in their guidance on their official website. We detail what two users revealabout UC by interrogating the effects of the fixed assessment period on their payment.Fiona, a white Scottish woman, is a single mother in her late thirties with two children. She works as a cleaner for a school that pays her every four weeks. In her first interview she told us she was experiencing significant difficulties understanding the UC payment calculation and anticipating her monthly payment. At the beginning of August – six weeks after her first interview – she reported that she was trying to get information from UC, both through her online account and the phone helpline, regarding her entitlement. Fiona worried that, due to being paid every four weeks, she would not gether entitlement in an upcoming month. She wrote to us via text, “Itried phone uc to be told [to] write my worries and questions online,so i have done this yesterday and waiting on response.” Knowing Far in advance whether she would get her entitlement especially mattered as her children are “not entitled to school meals so [she would] need to make sure [her] kids have lunch money”.Throughout August, September and October we received fre-quent, instant updates from Fiona on her interactions with differentUC case workers as she tried to understand when she would not receive a UC payment. Fiona’s updates included screenshots of messages she exchanged with case managers and phone calls elab-orating her worries and confusion. (See Fig. 2)At the end of September, Fiona shared that she still had not received a definitive answer regarding the month she would not receive UC payment: “I don’t know if it will be november or decem-ber or both i don’t get paid , it’s horrible.” In October she wrote,“the system is hellish”.She finally learned she would not receive UC payment in No-vember from her UC statement that month, sent only a few days before her payment would have been put in her bank account. Shewrote over text, “I’m not getting a november pay it’s come up £0 no one told me.”Throughout, she interacted with several different case managers.In our second interview in mid-January 2023, she told us how frus-trating and impersonal these interactions were: “Even [just] the same person replying to me would be better than a half assed con-versation.” She described her experience during the previous three months, saying, “I keep emailing them and writing, ‘Good after-noon, could someone help me understand the calculation behind this madness?’.” She shared that she had borrowed money from her son to “to keep [her] head above water until [she] get[s] paid.”Conflicts between employers’ payment policies and the UC as-sessment period can happen as people start new jobs or change their working hours. Jennifer, a white Scottish woman, is a single mother of two children in her early thirties who worked 16 hours a week as a family support worker when we first interviewed her inJune 2022. Overall, Jennifer seemed content with UC, though she had once experienced a mix-up with her wage-reporting that she said had been quickly resolved.In July she left her job due to mental health difficulties. UC required her to look for 25 hours of work to qualify for the benefit,and by October she found a 16 hour-a-week contract serving school dinners. She worried this change in employment would affect UCs automated payment since her new employer had not yet paid her first wages for the month of October. In mid-October she sent a text to say she feared she would receive no UC payment the fol-lowing month: “If [my wage payment] doesn’t fall into the window that [UC] create. 21 to 21st of each month I wont receive any payment.” If she was paid for her October hours and November Hours in the same month, then her combined earnings could put her over the threshold to qualify for UC, resulting in no UC payment in November.When we interviewed Jennifer again in January, she informed us that, indeed, her employer’s late October pay had resulted ina “dip” in UC – though her November payment “wasn’t zero, no,it just wasn’t as high as what [she] thought”. She expressed her frustration with UC’s rigid assessment period and how it accounts for when you are paid according to HMRC, but not the period you actually worked I’d waited a long time for my first wage so it looks like they had paid me twice. [. . . ] They put it in the same month so it looked like I got more which is a really frustrating part of universal credit.Jennifer also partly blamed herself for her changing circumstances;she had quit the school dinner post in early December to take another job in January as a pupil support assistant – a position she was excited about and felt more qualified for – for 25 hours a week.Reflecting on her two jobs Jennifer told us, “It is partly my fault, Ihave leapt from job to job in such a short amount of time.",1103-8,"In her first interview she was very unhappy with Universal Credit, highlighting that in the approximately three years she had been receiving it, she never felt supported and had received conflicting and wrong information [...] on her case from case workers and work coaches"
28,UniversalCredit,influencesPrecept,MentalHealthStrain,"we draw on an ongoing, empirical study examining Universal Credit (UC), an automated social security payment used in the United Kingdom. UC uses a dynamic, means-testing payment calculation to determine the monthly amount of claim people are entitled to. In this study we use serial interviews plus phone texts as prompts for solicit-ing feedback from users. We argue that ALL provides a unique opportunity to gather information on ADMS, both over time and in situ. Capturing information over time allows for more granular accounts of dynamic trajectories. Through the personal accounts of users reacting in situ, QLR also gives researchers insight into the emotional dimensions of users’ interactions with ADMS.In the following literature review, we cover the challenges schol-ars have confronted while studying ADMS, how scholars have studied users of ADMS to overcome these challenges, and the value and drawbacks of longitudinal research. [...] Administered by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP),Universal Credit is the UK’s largest social security payment. DWPintroduced UC in 2012, and it is set to replace some of the previ-ous benefits by 2024. The DWP terms UC ‘digital-by-default’ [27] since recipients apply for and receive payments through an online account. The account also acts as the primary mode of communica-tion with DWP staff (though people unable to maintain the online account can opt to interact solely by phone). UC is a means-tested and conditional benefit; to qualify, some claimants must work or look for work for a certain number of hours per week, based on their capability to work and certain life circumstances, such as having dependents.This study focuses on an essential automated decision-making feature of UC: its dynamic payment algorithm. UC uses automation to determine the amount of money claimants receive each month,based on calculating data points collected during a prior monthly assessment period. The monthly assessment period is a personal-ized unit of time based on the day a person applied for the benefit –for instance, if a person applies on February 15th, their assessment period will be from the 15th of a given month until the 14th of the next month. Claimants’ start with a ‘minimum standard allowance based on their age and relationship status (either single or living with a partner) and other factors such as disability or number of dependents. Payments will then be adjusted negatively depending on monthly earnings and deductions. Deductions include repayments for advance claims the claimant may have been granted in the past,past overpayments from UC and third-party deductions made at the request of a creditor, including rent arrears, utility arrears, Council Tax bill arrears, child support maintenance and fines by UC.For those working, the adjustments to UC based on monthly earnings happen automatically through a data exchange with theHMRC’s (HM Revenue and Customs) Real Time Information (RTI)system. Employers report their employees’ earnings using payroll software to RTI for tax purposes, and DWP accesses this stream of data daily. A report by Human Rights Watch [72] uses the metaphor of a camera to describe how STI affects the UC monthly assessment period:If the RTI system is a camera, the assessment period functions like a timer that tells it when to take a photo.The resulting snapshot is the earnings data that Universal Credit’s algorithm uses to calculate an individ-ual’s benefit payment for that month.UC considers all income that is reported to HMRC for self-reported by the claimant to UC during each monthly assessment period,and the UC payment decreases accordingly. After the monthly assessment of earnings, most claimants in the UK receive their payment once a month. In Scotland, people can choose to receive their monthly pay in two, approximately bi-weekly instalments.One goal of UC’s month-to-month calculation, based on actual earnings, is to eliminate some of the problems claimants faced withUK’s legacy social security systems. A previous benefit, WorkingTax Credits, had based claimants’ monthly payment on an average of earnings from the past year as reported to HMRC, and this aver-age could over- or under-estimated the benefit owed if a claimant's earnings changed. The discrepancies in reported versus actual earn-ings led claimants into debt to DWP if their earnings fell and rose but their tax credit payment stayed the same. UC aims to eliminate over- or under-payments to claimants – and falling into arrears toDWP – and reduce the burden on claimants to report changes in earnings [49]. DWP publishes very little documentation about UC’s perfor-mance data, “despite the evidence that the Universal Credit team have built up a modern analytics capability where real-time data would be the expectation” [57] (p.70). Likewise, it does not publish any public domain data about its digital services, with the exception of blog and a smattering of one-off research projects [3] nor about their source code [57]. While DWP has consulted the researchers of this project and asked us for updates on our findings in the form of reports, they did not agree to formal interviews about how the system works. Conducting research that can account for the experiences of people who claim Universal Credit is particularly crucial given DWP’s lack of transparency about how they study and understand the user experience. As will be shown later through the use of screenshots, our research gained insight into the interac-tion between claimants and social security agents, a largely unseen aspect of social security.In the following sections, we demonstrate how ALL methods focused on users of ADMS can be a powerful approach to collect data about systems, such as UC, that are highly complex and pose problems of access. [...] The data presented in this paper is from an ongoing qualitative, lon-gitudinal panel study conducted as part of a larger project exploring the lived experiences of recipients of UC.Our panel study commenced in mid-2022 and is expected to run until the end of 2023; this paper reports on data collected in the first six-month period of the study from participants who were recruited in 2022. The study applies two distinct methods of qualitative data collection for each participant: 1. semi-structured interviews and2. bi-weekly prompted updates sent over phone text asking about participants' interactions with UC.We recruited twenty-six participants through local charities by participating in their in-person events and by advertising the study their social media and mailing lists. Participants take part in the study over six or twelve months and were interviewed at the beginning of this period as well as after six months. Participants also receive text message prompts from the researchers roughly every two weeks asking for any updates on their interactions with UC. Participants used different methods to convey information: sending messages and sometimes screenshots of their interactions and accounts. Five participants at some point phoned the researchers to explain their situation rather than text. If asked for advice, researchers pointed participants to their case managers, work coachesand a local advice charity. The exception was a participant who had significant financial troubles, and the researchers believed that the participants’ children were at serious risk. On this occasion the researchers recommended a specific financial aid the participant could apply for.We gave participants a £25 shopping voucher after their first interview and a second one for a second interview at the six-month period to reimburse them for their time. The first interviews with each participant lasted for approximately forty-five minutes and were conducted either online or in person at local charity offices,cafés or at the University of Edinburgh. Follow up interviews lasted 15-30 minutes. The four participants whose quotes are used below reviewed and consented to their quotations and the representation of their stories.Data collection for this study was not without challenges. Twoparticipants never responded to the prompts and were eventually removed from the study. Twenty-one respondents provided us with relevant data about their interactions with Universal Credit; the rest,despite replying to prompts, either did not share any information that was related to the study or did not experience any problems with US during the first six months.We refer to our participants by pseudonyms. As some of our data was based on text messages and screenshots from our participants,quotes from these data sources often contain incorrect spelling or grammar. In order to preserve the original voice of our partici-pants, we kept these as they were, unless changes were crucial for intelligibility.The results of our study cannot be interpreted without taking the limitations of this study into consideration. Firstly, as is often the case with qualitative research, our sample was not representative,so the findings are not generalizable. Secondly, the language of the interviews and data collection in general was English; therefore,our study only includes participants who were able to speak inEnglish at least on a conversational level. Thirdly, our sample has a high number of participants who identify as female, thus, the view of male and non-binary participants are less pronounced in our dataset.Researchers received ethics approval for the study from theUniversity of Edinburgh. [...] The RTI to UC data pipeline, as mentioned, entails the flow of data from claimants’ employers to HMRC, where it becomes aggregated in its Real Time Information system. Though the data is collected for tax purposes, HMRC shares this data with UC daily, and UC uses it to adjust claimants’ monthly UC payment.As is the case with many vital infrastructures when they breakdown [69], the pipeline became most visible to claimants when errors were made at some point in these data exchange processes. RTI error rates are endemic to the system. The UK’s National AuditOffice (NAO) reported in 2018 that UC is “sensitive to any change in claimants’ monthly income” and “employers sometimes supply information [to RTI] that is late or which contains errors”[54](p.61). NAO estimated that in 2017-18, UC made overpayment of 7.2 percent and underpayments of 1.3 percent in part for this reason. [54] A result of these errors are fluctuations in claimants pay, making it difficult to budget and plan.Participants’ accounts detail the steps they took to rectify the errors. In some cases, claimants contacted their employer and UCto report the error, but they then had little agency over the timing of its correction. The only data seen as relevant by UC to rectifying the pay calculation is the HMRC RTI data, not any evidence offered by the claimant.Gaja, a white Polish woman in her late 40s raising two children,experienced an RTI error during the course of the study. In her first interview in June 2022, she described her case as relatively simple,telling us, “for me personally it works great,” even though working at a charity as a case worker she had seen problems with the paycalculation affecting her clients.In October 2022 Gaja reported over a text that she had received more payment from UC than anticipated and assumed her earnings had not been reported to HMRC, resulting in larger-than-usual UCentitlement; she wrote, “Something was not reported to [HMRC]and I told them [UC] that my award is too high, but, they can’t do anything about it, need to wait for hmrc information.”Gaja was not worried about budgeting but understood such mistakes could pose problems for others:I’ve got far too much money that I need to return [toUC], not really changing anything if you are aware of the mistake, this could be a different story if I wouldn't understand how they work and spend all the money.She pursued the matter with UC, then told us in early November,“they [UC] are still waiting for my employer to send the report sofar no news.” By late November she was still waiting for an update on the case.When we interviewed Gaja a second time in January, she told us that HMRC had finally reported the September earnings two months later in December, and the overpayment from UC wouldnow be deducted automatically from her future UC payments.

Emily, who identifies as Black Caribbeanand white, is a single mother of two children in her late thirties. Sheworks as an administrator for a center that provides a safe place for children to meet parents they do not live with. In her first interview she was very unhappy with Universal Credit, highlighting that in the approximately three years she had been receiving it, she never felt supported and had received conflicting and wrong information [...] on her case from case workers and work coaches. She had also encountered difficulties reclaiming childcare costs.In mid-January 2023, Emily shared over a text that her employer made an error reporting her salary in November 2022, and as a result she received £300 less in her January payment than she was entitled to.

As will be shown later through the use of screenshots, our research gained insight into the interac-tion between claimants and social security agents, a largely unseen aspect of social security.In the following sections, we demonstrate how ALL methods focused on users of ADMS can be a powerful approach to collect data about systems, such as UC, that are highly complex and pose problems of access. [...] The data presented in this paper is from an ongoing qualitative, lon-gitudinal panel study conducted as part of a larger project exploring the lived experiences of recipients of UC.Our panel study commenced in mid-2022 and is expected to run until the end of 2023; this paper reports on data collected in the first six-month period of the study from participants who were recruited in 2022. The study applies two distinct methods of qualitative data collection for each participant: 1. semi-structured interviews and2. bi-weekly prompted updates sent over phone text asking about participants' interactions with UC.We recruited twenty-six participants through local charities by participating in their in-person events and by advertising the study their social media and mailing lists. Participants take part in the study over six or twelve months and were interviewed at the beginning of this period as well as after six months. Participants also receive text message prompts from the researchers roughly every two weeks asking for any updates on their interactions with UC. Participants used different methods to convey information: sending messages and sometimes screenshots of their interactions and accounts. Five participants at some point phoned the researchers to explain their situation rather than text. If asked for advice, researchers pointed participants to their case managers, work coachesand a local advice charity. The exception was a participant who had significant financial troubles, and the researchers believed that the participants’ children were at serious risk. On this occasion the researchers recommended a specific financial aid the participant could apply for.We gave participants a £25 shopping voucher after their first interview and a second one for a second interview at the six-month period to reimburse them for their time. The first interviews with each participant lasted for approximately forty-five minutes and were conducted either online or in person at local charity offices,cafés or at the University of Edinburgh. Follow up interviews lasted 15-30 minutes. The four participants whose quotes are used below reviewed and consented to their quotations and the representation of their stories.Data collection for this study was not without challenges. Twoparticipants never responded to the prompts and were eventually removed from the study. Twenty-one respondents provided us with relevant data about their interactions with Universal Credit; the rest,despite replying to prompts, either did not share any information that was related to the study or did not experience any problems with US during the first six months.We refer to our participants by pseudonyms. As some of our data was based on text messages and screenshots from our participants,quotes from these data sources often contain incorrect spelling or grammar. In order to preserve the original voice of our partici-pants, we kept these as they were, unless changes were crucial for intelligibility.The results of our study cannot be interpreted without taking the limitations of this study into consideration. Firstly, as is often the case with qualitative research, our sample was not representative,so the findings are not generalizable. Secondly, the language of the interviews and data collection in general was English; therefore,our study only includes participants who were able to speak inEnglish at least on a conversational level. Thirdly, our sample has a high number of participants who identify as female, thus, the view of male and non-binary participants are less pronounced in our dataset.Researchers received ethics approval for the study from theUniversity of Edinburgh. [...] The RTI to UC data pipeline, as mentioned, entails the flow of data from claimants’ employers to HMRC, where it becomes aggregated in its Real Time Information system. Though the data is collected for tax purposes, HMRC shares this data with UC daily, and UC uses it to adjust claimants’ monthly UC payment.As is the case with many vital infrastructures when they breakdown [69], the pipeline became most visible to claimants when errors were made at some point in these data exchange processes. RTI error rates are endemic to the system. The UK’s National AuditOffice (NAO) reported in 2018 that UC is “sensitive to any change in claimants’ monthly income” and “employers sometimes supply information [to RTI] that is late or which contains errors”[54](p.61). NAO estimated that in 2017-18, UC made overpayment of 7.2 percent and underpayments of 1.3 percent in part for this reason. [54] A result of these errors are fluctuations in claimants pay, making it difficult to budget and plan.Participants’ accounts detail the steps they took to rectify the errors. In some cases, claimants contacted their employer and UCto report the error, but they then had little agency over the timing of its correction. The only data seen as relevant by UC to rectifying the pay calculation is the HMRC RTI data, not any evidence offered by the claimant.Gaja, a white Polish woman in her late 40s raising two children,experienced an RTI error during the course of the study. In her first interview in June 2022, she described her case as relatively simple,telling us, “for me personally it works great,” even though working at a charity as a case worker she had seen problems with the paycalculation affecting her clients.In October 2022 Gaja reported over a text that she had received more payment from UC than anticipated and assumed her earnings had not been reported to HMRC, resulting in larger-than-usual UCentitlement; she wrote, “Something was not reported to [HMRC]and I told them [UC] that my award is too high, but, they can’t do anything about it, need to wait for hmrc information.”Gaja was not worried about budgeting but understood such mistakes could pose problems for others:I’ve got far too much money that I need to return [toUC], not really changing anything if you are aware of the mistake, this could be a different story if I wouldn't understand how they work and spend all the money.She pursued the matter with UC, then told us in early November,“they [UC] are still waiting for my employer to send the report sofar no news.” By late November she was still waiting for an update on the case.When we interviewed Gaja a second time in January, she told us that HMRC had finally reported the September earnings two months later in December, and the overpayment from UC wouldnow be deducted automatically from her future UC payments. Heremployer told GaJa they had reported the earnings on time, so she never received an explanation for the delay and assumed that the mistake was due to her holding two jobs, and that HMRC had notregistered the wages for one. Gaja shared that she did not feel she could affect or speed up the process:I’ve informed universal credit that this will be a mis-take in payment. But they didn’t ask me about my wage slip or anything like that, they just said that it will clear up when they clear up because they need to listen to HMRC and not what I’m going to say.Gaja told us she was satisfied with how the situation was resolved and still much preferred UC, with its month-to-month calculations,to the older system used by Tax Credits, based on retrospective earnings data that so often led to overpayments and debt.Another participant in our study expressed more distress when she found an RTI error. Emily, who identifies as Black Caribbeanand white, is a single mother of two children in her late thirties. Sheworks as an administrator for a center that provides a safe place for children to meet parents they do not live with. In her first interview she was very unhappy with Universal Credit, highlighting that in the approximately three years she had been receiving it, she never felt supported and had received conflicting and wrong information [...] on her case from case workers and work coaches. She had also encountered difficulties reclaiming childcare costs.In mid-January 2023, Emily shared over a text that her employer made an error reporting her salary in November 2022, and as a result she received £300 less in her January payment than she was entitled to. Emily wrote, “I know the whole system [. . . ] is an absolute shambles. They are causing more hardship, it’s a horrible situation.” Emily shared screenshots of her exchange with her UC case manager after she reported the error in December. Her case manager told her that they would not be able to take action until January – UC needed to wait for confirmation from HMRC, which,in turn, needed a report from Emily’s employer. At the end ofDecember, she wrote to her case manager: “There is surely another way to rectify this so that I am not in financial crisis again. This is now adding to my mental health as I am not sleeping worrying.”(See Fig. 1)By mid-January Emily was distraught, texting us, “So I’m cur-rently waiting for that dispute to be resolved as I am once again out of pocket and struggling because of an error.”When we checked in at the end of January, Emily let us know,happily, that the error has been fixed thanks to her employer’s swift response: “My employer were very helpful and contacted HMRC atspeed and UC put the difference into my account on Friday. [. . . ]My work has been amazing, thankfully.”Despite this, Emily had experienced difficulties during this two-month period of uncertainty, writing, “Just frustrating [that] I had to get an advance on my wage from my work to survive. In addition to RTI-related errors, UC’s dynamic monthly payment presents another challenge for some working claimants. Noted previously by the Child Poverty Action Group [14] and Human RightsWatch [72], a punitive discrepancy can occur when a claimant's monthly assessment period, which reflects the amount of earnings a person receives within its time frame, is not in alignment with the period of work covered by the earnings. For most claimants,particularly those paid monthly, the UC assessment period will not pose problems. However, according to DWP’s own analysis,around 25 percent of claimants will find their benefits reduced because they are paid every two or four weeks. People who are not paid monthly but rather every two or four weeks will encounter certain assessment periods over the course of a year that captures two payments at once, one at the beginning and one at the end of the period. For instance, someone who receives their wage every four weeks will receive two sets of wages in one assessment pe-riod, roughly once every 13 months, and may receive reduced or no UC payment following this. DWP, well aware of this problem,calls these dual temporalities “different earning patterns” in their guidance on their official website. We detail what two users revealabout UC by interrogating the effects of the fixed assessment period on their payment.Fiona, a white Scottish woman, is a single mother in her late thirties with two children. She works as a cleaner for a school that pays her every four weeks. In her first interview she told us she was experiencing significant difficulties understanding the UC payment calculation and anticipating her monthly payment. At the beginning of August – six weeks after her first interview – she reported that she was trying to get information from UC, both through her online account and the phone helpline, regarding her entitlement. Fiona worried that, due to being paid every four weeks, she would not gether entitlement in an upcoming month. She wrote to us via text, “Itried phone uc to be told [to] write my worries and questions online,so i have done this yesterday and waiting on response.” Knowing Far in advance whether she would get her entitlement especially mattered as her children are “not entitled to school meals so [she would] need to make sure [her] kids have lunch money”.Throughout August, September and October we received fre-quent, instant updates from Fiona on her interactions with differentUC case workers as she tried to understand when she would not receive a UC payment. Fiona’s updates included screenshots of messages she exchanged with case managers and phone calls elab-orating her worries and confusion. (See Fig. 2)At the end of September, Fiona shared that she still had not received a definitive answer regarding the month she would not receive UC payment: “I don’t know if it will be november or decem-ber or both i don’t get paid , it’s horrible.” In October she wrote,“the system is hellish”.She finally learned she would not receive UC payment in No-vember from her UC statement that month, sent only a few days before her payment would have been put in her bank account. Shewrote over text, “I’m not getting a november pay it’s come up £0 no one told me.”Throughout, she interacted with several different case managers.In our second interview in mid-January 2023, she told us how frus-trating and impersonal these interactions were: “Even [just] the same person replying to me would be better than a half assed con-versation.” She described her experience during the previous three months, saying, “I keep emailing them and writing, ‘Good after-noon, could someone help me understand the calculation behind this madness?’.” She shared that she had borrowed money from her son to “to keep [her] head above water until [she] get[s] paid.”Conflicts between employers’ payment policies and the UC as-sessment period can happen as people start new jobs or change their working hours. Jennifer, a white Scottish woman, is a single mother of two children in her early thirties who worked 16 hours a week as a family support worker when we first interviewed her inJune 2022. Overall, Jennifer seemed content with UC, though she had once experienced a mix-up with her wage-reporting that she said had been quickly resolved.In July she left her job due to mental health difficulties. UC required her to look for 25 hours of work to qualify for the benefit,and by October she found a 16 hour-a-week contract serving school dinners. She worried this change in employment would affect UCs automated payment since her new employer had not yet paid her first wages for the month of October. In mid-October she sent a text to say she feared she would receive no UC payment the fol-lowing month: “If [my wage payment] doesn’t fall into the window that [UC] create. 21 to 21st of each month I wont receive any payment.” If she was paid for her October hours and November Hours in the same month, then her combined earnings could put her over the threshold to qualify for UC, resulting in no UC payment in November.When we interviewed Jennifer again in January, she informed us that, indeed, her employer’s late October pay had resulted ina “dip” in UC – though her November payment “wasn’t zero, no,it just wasn’t as high as what [she] thought”. She expressed her frustration with UC’s rigid assessment period and how it accounts for when you are paid according to HMRC, but not the period you actually worked I’d waited a long time for my first wage so it looks like they had paid me twice. [. . . ] They put it in the same month so it looked like I got more which is a really frustrating part of universal credit.Jennifer also partly blamed herself for her changing circumstances;she had quit the school dinner post in early December to take another job in January as a pupil support assistant – a position she was excited about and felt more qualified for – for 25 hours a week.Reflecting on her two jobs Jennifer told us, “It is partly my fault, Ihave leapt from job to job in such a short amount of time.",1103-8,25 percent of claimants will find their benefits reduced because they are paid every two or four weeks.
30,Frustration,constrainsAgent,UCClaimants,"we draw on an ongoing, empirical study examining Universal Credit (UC), an automated social security payment used in the United Kingdom. UC uses a dynamic, means-testing payment calculation to determine the monthly amount of claim people are entitled to. In this study we use serial interviews plus phone texts as prompts for solicit-ing feedback from users. We argue that ALL provides a unique opportunity to gather information on ADMS, both over time and in situ. Capturing information over time allows for more granular accounts of dynamic trajectories. Through the personal accounts of users reacting in situ, QLR also gives researchers insight into the emotional dimensions of users’ interactions with ADMS.In the following literature review, we cover the challenges schol-ars have confronted while studying ADMS, how scholars have studied users of ADMS to overcome these challenges, and the value and drawbacks of longitudinal research. [...] Administered by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP),Universal Credit is the UK’s largest social security payment. DWPintroduced UC in 2012, and it is set to replace some of the previ-ous benefits by 2024. The DWP terms UC ‘digital-by-default’ [27] since recipients apply for and receive payments through an online account. The account also acts as the primary mode of communica-tion with DWP staff (though people unable to maintain the online account can opt to interact solely by phone). UC is a means-tested and conditional benefit; to qualify, some claimants must work or look for work for a certain number of hours per week, based on their capability to work and certain life circumstances, such as having dependents.This study focuses on an essential automated decision-making feature of UC: its dynamic payment algorithm. UC uses automation to determine the amount of money claimants receive each month,based on calculating data points collected during a prior monthly assessment period. The monthly assessment period is a personal-ized unit of time based on the day a person applied for the benefit –for instance, if a person applies on February 15th, their assessment period will be from the 15th of a given month until the 14th of the next month. Claimants’ start with a ‘minimum standard allowance based on their age and relationship status (either single or living with a partner) and other factors such as disability or number of dependents. Payments will then be adjusted negatively depending on monthly earnings and deductions. Deductions include repayments for advance claims the claimant may have been granted in the past,past overpayments from UC and third-party deductions made at the request of a creditor, including rent arrears, utility arrears, Council Tax bill arrears, child support maintenance and fines by UC.For those working, the adjustments to UC based on monthly earnings happen automatically through a data exchange with theHMRC’s (HM Revenue and Customs) Real Time Information (RTI)system. Employers report their employees’ earnings using payroll software to RTI for tax purposes, and DWP accesses this stream of data daily. A report by Human Rights Watch [72] uses the metaphor of a camera to describe how STI affects the UC monthly assessment period:If the RTI system is a camera, the assessment period functions like a timer that tells it when to take a photo.The resulting snapshot is the earnings data that Universal Credit’s algorithm uses to calculate an individ-ual’s benefit payment for that month.UC considers all income that is reported to HMRC for self-reported by the claimant to UC during each monthly assessment period,and the UC payment decreases accordingly. After the monthly assessment of earnings, most claimants in the UK receive their payment once a month. In Scotland, people can choose to receive their monthly pay in two, approximately bi-weekly instalments.One goal of UC’s month-to-month calculation, based on actual earnings, is to eliminate some of the problems claimants faced withUK’s legacy social security systems. A previous benefit, WorkingTax Credits, had based claimants’ monthly payment on an average of earnings from the past year as reported to HMRC, and this aver-age could over- or under-estimated the benefit owed if a claimant's earnings changed. The discrepancies in reported versus actual earn-ings led claimants into debt to DWP if their earnings fell and rose but their tax credit payment stayed the same. UC aims to eliminate over- or under-payments to claimants – and falling into arrears toDWP – and reduce the burden on claimants to report changes in earnings [49]. DWP publishes very little documentation about UC’s perfor-mance data, “despite the evidence that the Universal Credit team have built up a modern analytics capability where real-time data would be the expectation” [57] (p.70). Likewise, it does not publish any public domain data about its digital services, with the exception of blog and a smattering of one-off research projects [3] nor about their source code [57]. While DWP has consulted the researchers of this project and asked us for updates on our findings in the form of reports, they did not agree to formal interviews about how the system works. Conducting research that can account for the experiences of people who claim Universal Credit is particularly crucial given DWP’s lack of transparency about how they study and understand the user experience. As will be shown later through the use of screenshots, our research gained insight into the interac-tion between claimants and social security agents, a largely unseen aspect of social security.In the following sections, we demonstrate how ALL methods focused on users of ADMS can be a powerful approach to collect data about systems, such as UC, that are highly complex and pose problems of access.

[. . . ] They put it in the same month so it looked like I got more which is a really frustrating part of universal credit.Jennifer also partly blamed herself for her changing circumstances;she had quit the school dinner post in early December to take another job in January as a pupil support assistant – a position she was excited about and felt more qualified for – for 25 hours a week.Reflecting on her two jobs Jennifer told us, “It is partly my fault, Ihave leapt from job to job in such a short amount of time.",1103-8,"She expressed her frustration with UC’s rigid assessment period and how it accounts for when you are paid according to HMRC, but not the period you actually worked I’d waited a long time for my first wage so it looks like they had paid me twice."
