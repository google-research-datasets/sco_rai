9,CausalInferenceAndML,Strategy,"The third case example shifts the target of focus. Examples 1 & 2 apply affordance framing to ML applications. Here instead, the analytic target isa social system, with affordances that can be identified and transformedthrough ML models. This move requires a reading of institutions (and their policies and practices) as artifacts of human making—implements that can be scrutinized and (re)designed in much the same way as material technologies.With this reading, institutions are subject to an affordance lens, while MLacts as a both a reflective mirror and constructive tool for social change.Specifically, the mechanisms and conditions framework can pair with MLoutputs to collaboratively reveal, and thus diagnose and amend, structural social patterns.A burgeoning argument contends that for purposes of addressing in-equality and human bias, ML is more effective at diagnosis and redress the prediction and decision making [47, 87]. This has been demonstrated across various spheres, in which ML decision systems consistently exacerbate inequality, yet also reveal the historical and ingrained circumstances that make inequality endemic. Here, I draw out one such instance: housing jus-tice and related wealth disparities as studied by So and colleagues out of the MIT Data Feminism Lab [88]. Using a combination of causal inference methods and ML, these researchers estimated the racial wealth gaps caused by generations of disparate access to home ownership and differential property values, calculating the reparations required to redress for these enduring im-balances and comparing that figure to an extant reparations program. Their Analyses of housing maps, census data, and economic indicators of return on investment (ROI) reveal significant wealth costs to borrowers of color due to institutional features such as redlining, subprime mortgages, and property grading that concentrate Black homeowners into poorly valued areas while devaluing the homes and neighborhoods where Black people live. They then devised an ML algorithm which calculates the amount necessary to remediate racial wealth gaps, comparing this calculation to a real reparations program in Evanston, Ill. Their findings show that the compensation levels of this reparations program are under-funded, requiring greater downpayment assistance and reconfigured debt-to-income ratios. Conveyed with an affordance framing in Table 5, we can thus say that in-stitutionalized lending practices have historically encouraged banks to denyBlack borrowers, requested disproportionate White wealth, and discouraged(perhaps refused) racial equity and neighborhood integration, while exist-ing reparative measures encourage remediation, but in their present form,refuse full compensation. Of note, ML is not necessary to recognize the intergenerational economic (and social) consequences of institutionalized wealth inequities tied to housing, loan, and insurance access. Nor do we need computational models to understand the validity of economic repara-tions. However, in the pairing of affordances with ML, these realities obtain not only clear articulation, but also weight and precision.ML-enabled indicators lay bare how social systems afford privilege and disadvantage, for whom, and to what effect. This sets the stage for interventions of both policy and practice. Such interventions are vital, lest we fall into datafied injustice, repeatedly quantifying a problem as though itis not already obvious [51]. In this vein, Barabas and colleagues point toML as a useful tool in hypothesis formation for causal inference procedures that enable randomized controlled trials of risk-needs interventions in the criminal justice system [87], while So et al., in the example from this section,use ML methods to not just evince racial wealth disparities in the US, but also to evaluate policies aimed at redress [88]. For each, the point is to shift institutional arrangements that encouraged housing, wealth, and freedom for White people disproportionately, to those that request recompense for these historically rooted circumstances and demand equity across racial groups.

This has been demonstrated across various spheres, in which ML decision systems consistently exacerbate inequality, yet also reveal the historical and ingrained circumstances that make inequality endemic. Here, I draw out one such instance: housing jus-tice and related wealth disparities as studied by So and colleagues out of the MIT Data Feminism Lab [88]. Using a combination of causal inference methods and ML, these researchers estimated the racial wealth gaps caused by generations of disparate access to home ownership and differential property values, calculating the reparations required to redress for these enduring im-balances and comparing that figure to an extant reparations program. Their Analyses of housing maps, census data, and economic indicators of return on investment (ROI) reveal significant wealth costs to borrowers of color due to institutional features such as redlining, subprime mortgages, and property grading that concentrate Black homeowners into poorly valued areas while devaluing the homes and neighborhoods where Black people live. They then devised an ML algorithm which calculates the amount necessary to remediate racial wealth gaps, comparing this calculation to a real reparations program in Evanston, Ill. Their findings show that the compensation levels of this reparations program are under-funded, requiring greater downpayment assistance and reconfigured debt-to-income ratios. Conveyed with an affordance framing in Table 5, we can thus say that in-stitutionalized lending practices have historically encouraged banks to denyBlack borrowers, requested disproportionate White wealth, and discouraged(perhaps refused) racial equity and neighborhood integration, while exist-ing reparative measures encourage remediation, but in their present form,refuse full compensation. Of note, ML is not necessary to recognize the intergenerational economic (and social) consequences of institutionalized wealth inequities tied to housing, loan, and insurance access. Nor do we need computational models to understand the validity of economic repara-tions. However, in the pairing of affordances with ML, these realities obtain not only clear articulation, but also weight and precision.ML-enabled indicators lay bare how social systems afford privilege and disadvantage, for whom, and to what effect. This sets the stage for interventions of both policy and practice. Such interventions are vital, lest we fall into datafied injustice, repeatedly quantifying a problem as though itis not already obvious [51]. In this vein, Barabas and colleagues point toML as a useful tool in hypothesis formation for causal inference procedures that enable randomized controlled trials of risk-needs interventions in the criminal justice system [87], while So et al., in the example from this section,use ML methods to not just evince racial wealth disparities in the US, but also to evaluate policies aimed at redress [88]. For each, the point is to shift institutional arrangements that encouraged housing, wealth, and freedom for White people disproportionately, to those that request recompense for these historically rooted circumstances and demand equity across racial groups.

Here instead, the analytic target isa social system, with affordances that can be identified and transformedthrough ML models. This move requires a reading of institutions (and their policies and practices) as artifacts of human making—implements that can be scrutinized and (re)designed in much the same way as material technologies.With this reading, institutions are subject to an affordance lens, while MLacts as a both a reflective mirror and constructive tool for social change.Specifically, the mechanisms and conditions framework can pair with MLoutputs to collaboratively reveal, and thus diagnose and amend, structural social patterns.A burgeoning argument contends that for purposes of addressing in-equality and human bias, ML is more effective at diagnosis and redress the prediction and decision making [47, 87].
