9,PrivacyConcerns,Perceived_Problem,"In cases where agencies consider expanding data collection require-ments for third party service providers, these third parties have reacted with privacy concerns. For example, the CFPB issued pol-icy guidance in 2018 regarding loan-level data collected under theHome Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA), which requires lenders to collect demographic data from mortgage applicants [20, p. 18]. The Guidance recommended that loan-level data should be modified before public releases to prevent individual borrower re-identification.CFPB noted several industry comments which argued that privacy measures “did not sufficiently address” the risks of disclosure, but these comments “offered little evidence or analysis to support their views.” Some industry commenters stated that the CFPB should only release aggregate-level data, or not release any data to protect borrowers' privacy. One commenter stated, “if there is ‘any chance that HMDA data could be used for criminal purposes, the benefits of disclosure could not outweigh the privacy risks.” In contrast, con-sumer advocates argued that loan-level data has “long been publicly disclosed without any evidence the data has been used to harm ap-plicants and borrowers.” CFPB concluded that the risks—which are nonzero—“are justified by the benefits in light of HMDA’s purposes”[20]. A similar tension when the Equal Employment OpportunityCommission (EEOC) considered collecting pay data in addition to demographic data to target wage discrimination. During the initial research process in 2012, employers’ representatives expressed con-cerns about protecting individual privacy in aggregate data releases,so the EEOC re-examined statistical confidentiality standards to ensure tables with small cell-counts would be kept private [43].After a multi-year, intensive research process, OMB decided in 2016 to begin collecting pay data. In 2017, OMB abruptly changed course,staying pay data collection on the grounds that it “lacks practical utility, is unnecessarily burdensome, and does not adequately ad-dress privacy and confidentiality issues” [116]. After worker groups sued, a federal judge reinstated pay data collection in 2019, findingOMB’s decision arbitrary and capricious and reiterating the value of pay data for self-monitoring and enforcement purposes [129].Even so, in 2020, Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (R-NC) said in a hearing “that the commission has no way of keeping [pay data]confidential” [84].These cases illustrate the tension between protecting individ-ual privacy and collecting and releasing data necessary for bias assessment. Even in cases where federal agencies institute technical privacy protections to mitigate concerns, the question of how pri-vacy risks should be weighed against the benefits of data collection remains.",498-9,reacted with privacy concerns.,
