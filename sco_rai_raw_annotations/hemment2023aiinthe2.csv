9,ResponsibilityJudgements,Perceived_Problem,"Here we consider what workshop participants thought is and isn't an artist’s responsibility in regard to AI literacies (RQ2). One of the main themes discussed was the degree to which it is or isn’t for artists to be positioned as educators. The workshop participants agreed that art can play a pedagogic role, though there was some nuanced understanding of how this might play out. There was agreement among participants not to ‘instrumentalise’ art. Participant 7 talked about the role of artistic autonomy, separate from academic or commercial spheres: “an artist is not an educationalist.” An artist can contribute pedagogically, but in ways that don’t undermine their autonomy. As Anna put it, art is not “glorified graphic design for how ML works,” functioning at the service of one specific edifying purpose – the aesthetic dimensions of an artwork cannot be tied to a particular utility. A difference, therefore, between art and other AI public literacy approaches is that an artwork can function at the same time as an aesthetic piece in its own right, even if it also aims to educate. The Artists who took part, for instance, mentioned other motivations for their work, beyond edifying.The artists in the workshop all saw their art as political, and a sense of responsibility is integral to their practice. Jake viewed themselves as part of a relatively small group of creators who used ML as a tool of their practice but also to comment on MLas a political and ethical concern. Caroline positioned her work explicitly within traditions of social justice and human rights-drivenart. Caroline linked the ability for art to engage in explainability and legibility of AI systems directly to a political project itself –she didn’t see a distinction between giving greater visibility to the technical aspects of systems and linking them to a broader political economic context. To her, “art can totally provide solutions, explanatory and also at times even ridiculously pedantic.” Making AI systems legible was a political project and part of her work as an activist.",937-8,thought is and isn't an artist’s responsibility in regard to AI literacies,
