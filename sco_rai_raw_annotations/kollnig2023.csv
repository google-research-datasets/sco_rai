9,DesireForChangesToApps,Perceived_Problem,"To explore the space of potential user needs that might be served by an ability to extend and change the functionality of existing mobile apps, we conducted an open-ended survey with 100 partici-pants and a fictional app repair tool. We studied what individuals,if given a chance, would like to change about the apps they of-ten use concerning the user interface and underlying app logic through a speculative role-playing design prompt, similar to previous work [82]. We chose to conduct a survey to be able to scale across more individuals and elicit a more diverse range of response than we could do with other methods, such as interviews.Study Design. Our survey had three parts: 1) demographics and app use, 2) speculative role-playing design of app changes, and 3)user reflections. In the speculative design exercise, we introduced the concept of app changes through a speculative role-playing de-sign prompt, similar to previous work by Merrill [82]. We asked participants to imagine being granted two ‘app-modification su-perpowers’ by a benevolent ‘app genie’, thereby comparing app changes to magic – almost anything is possible. We then repeatedly asked participants how they would use those two superpowers to change the apps that they often use. Such repeated questioning is a commonly used method in user research to spur creativity, e.g., bySakichi Toyoda’s ‘Five Whys’ [99]. Firstly, participants were asked to make between four and seven suggestions on how to change their three most used apps (as provided in the first part of the survey).This first part is visualized in Figure ?? in the Appendix. Secondly,participants were asked to make between three and six suggestions on how to change any app on their phone. We encouraged partic-ipants to take out their phones as part of this process to help the design exercise. In total, participants would make between seven and 13 suggestions for app changes. The full survey can be found in the Appendix.Recruitment and Ethics Approval. Due to the qualitative na-ture of our survey, we did not need a large sample size to achieve saturation [60]. Therefore, we recruited 100 participants using Prolific, an online platform for research participant recruitment. We Restricted recruitment to current or past Android users (who would be more likely to be able to adopt app repair technology, due to iOSrestrictions), aged 18–40 years (to focus on those adults who spend most time with mobile devices for their day-to-day social and professional activities [106]). Participants were compensated for their time. Our departmental ethics board approved the study (approval reference CS_C1A_021_021). It took participants a median of 19.8minutes to complete the survey.Data Analysis and Sharing. For open-ended responses, we con-ducted a thematic analysis to look for underlying patterns within our dataset. Initially, we started with an inductive approach, where three authors of this paper independently developed an initial set of codes, from a different set of 100 suggested app changes. Theauthors then met and discussed the codes to achieve consensus and develop a codebook. Finally, the first author completed the coding using a deductive method, and formed themes based on the previously-identified codes. In total, we identified 29 codes, and 5 themes.3.1 Results 3.1.1 Participant Demographics. Fifty-nine participants identified as men and 40 as women. One participant did not disclose this information. Fifty-one participants resided in Poland, 21 in SouthAfrica, five in Portugal, five in Greece, four in Spain, four in Italy,and the remaining seven in other European countries (with the exception of one participant from Israel).3.1.2 Overview of Suggested App Changes. Throughout the survey,the most commonly selected apps to make modifications to wereInstagram (selected by 54 participants), Messenger (52), Facebook(49), YouTube (45), and WhatsApp (41). Participants suggested a total of 734 app changes. After a review of all changes, we excluded five responses because we did not understand them or because they did not include any changes. We also excluded another 166 suggestions that were not directly actionable or relevant for apprepair, e.g., because they pertained to changes to server-side code or were too abstract.The set of actionable and relevant app changes represents those that may actually be implemented through app repair and client-side changes. These changes related to three themes namely, i)making apps’ business models more user-friendly and respectful,ii) the wish for more attractive, user-friendly, and accessible user interfaces, and iii) rebalancing privacy and security in apps. Wedescribe each of these themes in the following.Making apps’ business models more user-friendly and respectful. In this theme, 60% of participants complained about how apps generate revenue. This was mainly related to advertising (42%of users), being the predominant monetisation model in the app ecosystem.[I would wish for] A built-in ad blocker in the browser that blocks intrusive ads (P65, Chrome)ads, ads, ads, ads, ads, ads, ads, ads, ads, ads (P65, YouTube)Beyond ads, another common monetisation model on Androidare in-app purchases. This model can, by its design, conflict with the actions that users take within apps. 4% of participants expressed such annoyance with regards to non-ad app monetisation.Less pay to win system and a better leaderboard for ranked(P56, Clash Royale) Paid options and subscriptions everywhere. It is very annoy-ing when using the app (P66, Tinder)A related category comprises patches that provide paid features for free (wished for by 19% of participants). A common concern was monetisation by YouTube, which does not allow playing videos in the background without a subscription.I would have free access to premium content because most people cannot afford it (P71, YouTube)Since such modifications might constitute fraud, they should not be developed.The wish for more attractive, user-friendly, and accessible user interfaces. Within this theme, the most common suggestions related to modifications to the user interface (UI) – mentioned by92% of participants. A common complaint was that a specific app was not ‘user-friendly’ (P22) or not ‘accessible’ (P13) enough. A Particular case of such UI improvements were cosmetic changes,e.g. to the color or theme of certain apps.The app looks very primitive and uninspired, almost unpro-fessional. (P23, about Steam) Change the app to to another color. I am getting tired of the blue bird (P1, about Twitter)Given that 39% of participants expressed such sentiments, there seems to be a rather widespread desire for self-expression and customisation in apps’ user interfaces.As for how to improve the UI, 47% of participants suggested removing certain interface elements or features. Many were unhappy with the prominently placed ‘Reels’ (P67) and ‘Stories’ (P95) in theInstagram app, the WhatsApp status page (P82), the promotion of podcasts in the Spotify app (P73), or the new TikTok-like YouTube‘Shorts’ (P32). Participants wanted to hide these elements because all of these apps do not currently provide options to do so. I hate the ""YouTube Shorts"" feature, I don’t use it at all and Idon’t find it necessary. I just don’t need it. (P32, YouTube)Have options to hide Instagram stories (P95, Instagram)Some participants complained about the metrification of social media apps and the resulting impact on individuals. Such can be present in many different forms on social media, e.g. in terms of number of friends, post views, and likes. Metrification allows users to judge the virality of social media content but can also put pressure on individuals to create and post more viral content. I would hide the amount of like when someone posts. be-cause I feel that most people just post nonsensical thing just to get likes. (P94, Twitter)15% of participants complained about forced actions, a kind of deceptive design [55], that forces individuals to take certain actions.One example is the design of Google Mail, where it is deliberately challenging to sign out only one user at a time.I would make it easier to log out and also not to log out all accounts at once. (P2, Google Mail)Another aspect that participants complained about was that Insta-gram recently replaced the ‘New Post’ button with a new button to access the new ‘Reels’ (i.e. short videos like on TikTok) – and wanted to roll back to the previous design (a class of patches mentioned by 8% of participants).Rebalancing privacy and security in apps. The last theme related to changing apps’ privacy and security practices (mentioned by 55% of participants). Users’ desire for more privacy and secu-rity in apps is well documented in the research literature, as is the relative lack of such in practice [100, 113]. Recent initiatives like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the EU and new privacy protections measures on iOS and Android have ar-guably further spurred this desire. This theme included the wish for protection from other users of the service (25%), as illustrated here:Must not allow people to take screenshots or save what others have posted on their status (P37, WhatsApp)This desire was in tension with a wish by others to more conve-niently save others’ activities (11%).Be able to save people’s videos or pictures from the app with-out the need of installing downloading app (P37, Instagram)Finally, participants expressed a need to protect their own data from the companies. 13% of participants wished for better protection of their location, and 12% of participants wanted less tracking of their activities in general and better protection from them:Ensure no data is being sent to Facebook, I dislike knowing that Whatsapp is owned by Facebook (P84, WhatsApp)Browse without cookies and no product tracking. (P1, Chrome)3.1.3 Participant Reflections. In the last survey part, we asked participants to reflect on their previous app experiences. Asked What they did in the past when they were unhappy with an app,most said that they did nothing (54%). Many researched how to fix the problem themselves (40%) or complained on social media (30%).Some reached out to app developers either in private (17%) or public(7%). This suggests that many end-users are resigned to the current design of their apps. 85 participants (85%) said that the ability to make changes to their apps would be ‘rather’ useful for them. This is in line with previous research which suggests that users want more control over online services they use, especially as a protection from deceptive designs [18, 54]. Among the remaining 15 participants(answering ‘rather no’), 7 expressed that they would not want to make changes that they find sufficiently important (‘I don’t really care that much as long as it works’, P46), while another 7 said that this would not be possible in practice or that they lacked the time and skills (‘I don’t have the knowledge for that’, P12). Choosingbetween ‘rather yes’ and ‘rather no’, sixty-nine participants said rather yes’ to giving everyone the ability to make such changes.Among those that did not want this (answering ‘rather no’), the reasons were varied and included concerns around feasibility (5%,‘it would be too hard to programme that’, P10), security (4%, ‘devices are designed to function in certain way’, P42), and the acts of others(4%, ‘they should have the independent right to change the setting on their OWN phone but it should limit to that’, P65).

Choosingbetween ‘rather yes’ and ‘rather no’, sixty-nine participants said rather yes’ to giving everyone the ability to make such changes.Among those that did not want this (answering ‘rather no’), the reasons were varied and included concerns around feasibility (5%,‘it would be too hard to programme that’, P10), security (4%, ‘devices are designed to function in certain way’, P42), and the acts of others(4%, ‘they should have the independent right to change the setting on their OWN phone but it should limit to that’, P65).

12,DesireForPrivacyAndSecurity,Perceived_Need,"To explore the space of potential user needs that might be served by an ability to extend and change the functionality of existing mobile apps, we conducted an open-ended survey with 100 partici-pants and a fictional app repair tool. We studied what individuals,if given a chance, would like to change about the apps they of-ten use concerning the user interface and underlying app logic through a speculative role-playing design prompt, similar to previous work [82]. We chose to conduct a survey to be able to scale across more individuals and elicit a more diverse range of response than we could do with other methods, such as interviews.Study Design. Our survey had three parts: 1) demographics and app use, 2) speculative role-playing design of app changes, and 3)user reflections. In the speculative design exercise, we introduced the concept of app changes through a speculative role-playing de-sign prompt, similar to previous work by Merrill [82]. We asked participants to imagine being granted two ‘app-modification su-perpowers’ by a benevolent ‘app genie’, thereby comparing app changes to magic – almost anything is possible. We then repeatedly asked participants how they would use those two superpowers to change the apps that they often use. Such repeated questioning is a commonly used method in user research to spur creativity, e.g., bySakichi Toyoda’s ‘Five Whys’ [99]. Firstly, participants were asked to make between four and seven suggestions on how to change their three most used apps (as provided in the first part of the survey).This first part is visualized in Figure ?? in the Appendix. Secondly,participants were asked to make between three and six suggestions on how to change any app on their phone. We encouraged partic-ipants to take out their phones as part of this process to help the design exercise. In total, participants would make between seven and 13 suggestions for app changes. The full survey can be found in the Appendix.Recruitment and Ethics Approval. Due to the qualitative na-ture of our survey, we did not need a large sample size to achieve saturation [60]. Therefore, we recruited 100 participants using Prolific, an online platform for research participant recruitment. We Restricted recruitment to current or past Android users (who would be more likely to be able to adopt app repair technology, due to iOSrestrictions), aged 18–40 years (to focus on those adults who spend most time with mobile devices for their day-to-day social and professional activities [106]). Participants were compensated for their time. Our departmental ethics board approved the study (approval reference CS_C1A_021_021). It took participants a median of 19.8minutes to complete the survey.Data Analysis and Sharing. For open-ended responses, we con-ducted a thematic analysis to look for underlying patterns within our dataset. Initially, we started with an inductive approach, where three authors of this paper independently developed an initial set of codes, from a different set of 100 suggested app changes. Theauthors then met and discussed the codes to achieve consensus and develop a codebook. Finally, the first author completed the coding using a deductive method, and formed themes based on the previously-identified codes. In total, we identified 29 codes, and 5 themes.3.1 Results 3.1.1 Participant Demographics. Fifty-nine participants identified as men and 40 as women. One participant did not disclose this information. Fifty-one participants resided in Poland, 21 in SouthAfrica, five in Portugal, five in Greece, four in Spain, four in Italy,and the remaining seven in other European countries (with the exception of one participant from Israel).3.1.2 Overview of Suggested App Changes. Throughout the survey,the most commonly selected apps to make modifications to wereInstagram (selected by 54 participants), Messenger (52), Facebook(49), YouTube (45), and WhatsApp (41). Participants suggested a total of 734 app changes. After a review of all changes, we excluded five responses because we did not understand them or because they did not include any changes. We also excluded another 166 suggestions that were not directly actionable or relevant for apprepair, e.g., because they pertained to changes to server-side code or were too abstract.The set of actionable and relevant app changes represents those that may actually be implemented through app repair and client-side changes. These changes related to three themes namely, i)making apps’ business models more user-friendly and respectful,ii) the wish for more attractive, user-friendly, and accessible user interfaces, and iii) rebalancing privacy and security in apps. Wedescribe each of these themes in the following.Making apps’ business models more user-friendly and respectful. In this theme, 60% of participants complained about how apps generate revenue. This was mainly related to advertising (42%of users), being the predominant monetisation model in the app ecosystem.[I would wish for] A built-in ad blocker in the browser that blocks intrusive ads (P65, Chrome)ads, ads, ads, ads, ads, ads, ads, ads, ads, ads (P65, YouTube)Beyond ads, another common monetisation model on Androidare in-app purchases. This model can, by its design, conflict with the actions that users take within apps. 4% of participants expressed such annoyance with regards to non-ad app monetisation.Less pay to win system and a better leaderboard for ranked(P56, Clash Royale) Paid options and subscriptions everywhere. It is very annoy-ing when using the app (P66, Tinder)A related category comprises patches that provide paid features for free (wished for by 19% of participants). A common concern was monetisation by YouTube, which does not allow playing videos in the background without a subscription.I would have free access to premium content because most people cannot afford it (P71, YouTube)Since such modifications might constitute fraud, they should not be developed.The wish for more attractive, user-friendly, and accessible user interfaces. Within this theme, the most common suggestions related to modifications to the user interface (UI) – mentioned by92% of participants. A common complaint was that a specific app was not ‘user-friendly’ (P22) or not ‘accessible’ (P13) enough. A Particular case of such UI improvements were cosmetic changes,e.g. to the color or theme of certain apps.The app looks very primitive and uninspired, almost unpro-fessional. (P23, about Steam) Change the app to to another color. I am getting tired of the blue bird (P1, about Twitter)Given that 39% of participants expressed such sentiments, there seems to be a rather widespread desire for self-expression and customisation in apps’ user interfaces.As for how to improve the UI, 47% of participants suggested removing certain interface elements or features. Many were unhappy with the prominently placed ‘Reels’ (P67) and ‘Stories’ (P95) in theInstagram app, the WhatsApp status page (P82), the promotion of podcasts in the Spotify app (P73), or the new TikTok-like YouTube‘Shorts’ (P32). Participants wanted to hide these elements because all of these apps do not currently provide options to do so. I hate the ""YouTube Shorts"" feature, I don’t use it at all and Idon’t find it necessary. I just don’t need it. (P32, YouTube)Have options to hide Instagram stories (P95, Instagram)Some participants complained about the metrification of social media apps and the resulting impact on individuals. Such can be present in many different forms on social media, e.g. in terms of number of friends, post views, and likes. Metrification allows users to judge the virality of social media content but can also put pressure on individuals to create and post more viral content. I would hide the amount of like when someone posts. be-cause I feel that most people just post nonsensical thing just to get likes. (P94, Twitter)15% of participants complained about forced actions, a kind of deceptive design [55], that forces individuals to take certain actions.One example is the design of Google Mail, where it is deliberately challenging to sign out only one user at a time.I would make it easier to log out and also not to log out all accounts at once. (P2, Google Mail)Another aspect that participants complained about was that Insta-gram recently replaced the ‘New Post’ button with a new button to access the new ‘Reels’ (i.e. short videos like on TikTok) – and wanted to roll back to the previous design (a class of patches mentioned by 8% of participants).Rebalancing privacy and security in apps. The last theme related to changing apps’ privacy and security practices (mentioned by 55% of participants). Users’ desire for more privacy and secu-rity in apps is well documented in the research literature, as is the relative lack of such in practice [100, 113]. Recent initiatives like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the EU and new privacy protections measures on iOS and Android have ar-guably further spurred this desire. This theme included the wish for protection from other users of the service (25%), as illustrated here:Must not allow people to take screenshots or save what others have posted on their status (P37, WhatsApp)This desire was in tension with a wish by others to more conve-niently save others’ activities (11%).Be able to save people’s videos or pictures from the app with-out the need of installing downloading app (P37, Instagram)Finally, participants expressed a need to protect their own data from the companies. 13% of participants wished for better protection of their location, and 12% of participants wanted less tracking of their activities in general and better protection from them:Ensure no data is being sent to Facebook, I dislike knowing that Whatsapp is owned by Facebook (P84, WhatsApp)Browse without cookies and no product tracking. (P1, Chrome)3.1.3 Participant Reflections. In the last survey part, we asked participants to reflect on their previous app experiences. Asked What they did in the past when they were unhappy with an app,most said that they did nothing (54%). Many researched how to fix the problem themselves (40%) or complained on social media (30%).Some reached out to app developers either in private (17%) or public(7%). This suggests that many end-users are resigned to the current design of their apps. 85 participants (85%) said that the ability to make changes to their apps would be ‘rather’ useful for them. This is in line with previous research which suggests that users want more control over online services they use, especially as a protection from deceptive designs [18, 54]. Among the remaining 15 participants(answering ‘rather no’), 7 expressed that they would not want to make changes that they find sufficiently important (‘I don’t really care that much as long as it works’, P46), while another 7 said that this would not be possible in practice or that they lacked the time and skills (‘I don’t have the knowledge for that’, P12).

Choosingbetween ‘rather yes’ and ‘rather no’, sixty-nine participants said rather yes’ to giving everyone the ability to make such changes.Among those that did not want this (answering ‘rather no’), the reasons were varied and included concerns around feasibility (5%,‘it would be too hard to programme that’, P10), security (4%, ‘devices are designed to function in certain way’, P42), and the acts of others(4%, ‘they should have the independent right to change the setting on their OWN phone but it should limit to that’, P65).

15,Resignation,Strategy,"To explore the space of potential user needs that might be served by an ability to extend and change the functionality of existing mobile apps, we conducted an open-ended survey with 100 partici-pants and a fictional app repair tool. We studied what individuals,if given a chance, would like to change about the apps they of-ten use concerning the user interface and underlying app logic through a speculative role-playing design prompt, similar to previous work [82]. We chose to conduct a survey to be able to scale across more individuals and elicit a more diverse range of response than we could do with other methods, such as interviews.Study Design. Our survey had three parts: 1) demographics and app use, 2) speculative role-playing design of app changes, and 3)user reflections. In the speculative design exercise, we introduced the concept of app changes through a speculative role-playing de-sign prompt, similar to previous work by Merrill [82]. We asked participants to imagine being granted two ‘app-modification su-perpowers’ by a benevolent ‘app genie’, thereby comparing app changes to magic – almost anything is possible. We then repeatedly asked participants how they would use those two superpowers to change the apps that they often use. Such repeated questioning is a commonly used method in user research to spur creativity, e.g., bySakichi Toyoda’s ‘Five Whys’ [99]. Firstly, participants were asked to make between four and seven suggestions on how to change their three most used apps (as provided in the first part of the survey).This first part is visualized in Figure ?? in the Appendix. Secondly,participants were asked to make between three and six suggestions on how to change any app on their phone. We encouraged partic-ipants to take out their phones as part of this process to help the design exercise. In total, participants would make between seven and 13 suggestions for app changes. The full survey can be found in the Appendix.Recruitment and Ethics Approval. Due to the qualitative na-ture of our survey, we did not need a large sample size to achieve saturation [60]. Therefore, we recruited 100 participants using Prolific, an online platform for research participant recruitment. We Restricted recruitment to current or past Android users (who would be more likely to be able to adopt app repair technology, due to iOSrestrictions), aged 18–40 years (to focus on those adults who spend most time with mobile devices for their day-to-day social and professional activities [106]). Participants were compensated for their time. Our departmental ethics board approved the study (approval reference CS_C1A_021_021). It took participants a median of 19.8minutes to complete the survey.Data Analysis and Sharing. For open-ended responses, we con-ducted a thematic analysis to look for underlying patterns within our dataset. Initially, we started with an inductive approach, where three authors of this paper independently developed an initial set of codes, from a different set of 100 suggested app changes. Theauthors then met and discussed the codes to achieve consensus and develop a codebook. Finally, the first author completed the coding using a deductive method, and formed themes based on the previously-identified codes. In total, we identified 29 codes, and 5 themes.3.1 Results 3.1.1 Participant Demographics. Fifty-nine participants identified as men and 40 as women. One participant did not disclose this information. Fifty-one participants resided in Poland, 21 in SouthAfrica, five in Portugal, five in Greece, four in Spain, four in Italy,and the remaining seven in other European countries (with the exception of one participant from Israel).3.1.2 Overview of Suggested App Changes. Throughout the survey,the most commonly selected apps to make modifications to wereInstagram (selected by 54 participants), Messenger (52), Facebook(49), YouTube (45), and WhatsApp (41). Participants suggested a total of 734 app changes. After a review of all changes, we excluded five responses because we did not understand them or because they did not include any changes. We also excluded another 166 suggestions that were not directly actionable or relevant for apprepair, e.g., because they pertained to changes to server-side code or were too abstract.The set of actionable and relevant app changes represents those that may actually be implemented through app repair and client-side changes. These changes related to three themes namely, i)making apps’ business models more user-friendly and respectful,ii) the wish for more attractive, user-friendly, and accessible user interfaces, and iii) rebalancing privacy and security in apps. Wedescribe each of these themes in the following.Making apps’ business models more user-friendly and respectful. In this theme, 60% of participants complained about how apps generate revenue. This was mainly related to advertising (42%of users), being the predominant monetisation model in the app ecosystem.[I would wish for] A built-in ad blocker in the browser that blocks intrusive ads (P65, Chrome)ads, ads, ads, ads, ads, ads, ads, ads, ads, ads (P65, YouTube)Beyond ads, another common monetisation model on Androidare in-app purchases. This model can, by its design, conflict with the actions that users take within apps. 4% of participants expressed such annoyance with regards to non-ad app monetisation.Less pay to win system and a better leaderboard for ranked(P56, Clash Royale) Paid options and subscriptions everywhere. It is very annoy-ing when using the app (P66, Tinder)A related category comprises patches that provide paid features for free (wished for by 19% of participants). A common concern was monetisation by YouTube, which does not allow playing videos in the background without a subscription.I would have free access to premium content because most people cannot afford it (P71, YouTube)Since such modifications might constitute fraud, they should not be developed.The wish for more attractive, user-friendly, and accessible user interfaces. Within this theme, the most common suggestions related to modifications to the user interface (UI) – mentioned by92% of participants. A common complaint was that a specific app was not ‘user-friendly’ (P22) or not ‘accessible’ (P13) enough. A Particular case of such UI improvements were cosmetic changes,e.g. to the color or theme of certain apps.The app looks very primitive and uninspired, almost unpro-fessional. (P23, about Steam) Change the app to to another color. I am getting tired of the blue bird (P1, about Twitter)Given that 39% of participants expressed such sentiments, there seems to be a rather widespread desire for self-expression and customisation in apps’ user interfaces.As for how to improve the UI, 47% of participants suggested removing certain interface elements or features. Many were unhappy with the prominently placed ‘Reels’ (P67) and ‘Stories’ (P95) in theInstagram app, the WhatsApp status page (P82), the promotion of podcasts in the Spotify app (P73), or the new TikTok-like YouTube‘Shorts’ (P32). Participants wanted to hide these elements because all of these apps do not currently provide options to do so. I hate the ""YouTube Shorts"" feature, I don’t use it at all and Idon’t find it necessary. I just don’t need it. (P32, YouTube)Have options to hide Instagram stories (P95, Instagram)Some participants complained about the metrification of social media apps and the resulting impact on individuals. Such can be present in many different forms on social media, e.g. in terms of number of friends, post views, and likes. Metrification allows users to judge the virality of social media content but can also put pressure on individuals to create and post more viral content. I would hide the amount of like when someone posts. be-cause I feel that most people just post nonsensical thing just to get likes. (P94, Twitter)15% of participants complained about forced actions, a kind of deceptive design [55], that forces individuals to take certain actions.One example is the design of Google Mail, where it is deliberately challenging to sign out only one user at a time.I would make it easier to log out and also not to log out all accounts at once. (P2, Google Mail)Another aspect that participants complained about was that Insta-gram recently replaced the ‘New Post’ button with a new button to access the new ‘Reels’ (i.e. short videos like on TikTok) – and wanted to roll back to the previous design (a class of patches mentioned by 8% of participants).Rebalancing privacy and security in apps. The last theme related to changing apps’ privacy and security practices (mentioned by 55% of participants). Users’ desire for more privacy and secu-rity in apps is well documented in the research literature, as is the relative lack of such in practice [100, 113]. Recent initiatives like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the EU and new privacy protections measures on iOS and Android have ar-guably further spurred this desire. This theme included the wish for protection from other users of the service (25%), as illustrated here:Must not allow people to take screenshots or save what others have posted on their status (P37, WhatsApp)This desire was in tension with a wish by others to more conve-niently save others’ activities (11%).Be able to save people’s videos or pictures from the app with-out the need of installing downloading app (P37, Instagram)Finally, participants expressed a need to protect their own data from the companies. 13% of participants wished for better protection of their location, and 12% of participants wanted less tracking of their activities in general and better protection from them:Ensure no data is being sent to Facebook, I dislike knowing that Whatsapp is owned by Facebook (P84, WhatsApp)Browse without cookies and no product tracking. (P1, Chrome)3.1.3 Participant Reflections. In the last survey part, we asked participants to reflect on their previous app experiences. Asked What they did in the past when they were unhappy with an app,most said that they did nothing (54%). Many researched how to fix the problem themselves (40%) or complained on social media (30%).Some reached out to app developers either in private (17%) or public(7%). This suggests that many end-users are resigned to the current design of their apps. 85 participants (85%) said that the ability to make changes to their apps would be ‘rather’ useful for them. This is in line with previous research which suggests that users want more control over online services they use, especially as a protection from deceptive designs [18, 54]. Among the remaining 15 participants(answering ‘rather no’), 7 expressed that they would not want to make changes that they find sufficiently important (‘I don’t really care that much as long as it works’, P46), while another 7 said that this would not be possible in practice or that they lacked the time and skills (‘I don’t have the knowledge for that’, P12).

Among the remaining 15 participants(answering ‘rather no’), 7 expressed that they would not want to make changes that they find sufficiently important (‘I don’t really care that much as long as it works’, P46), while another 7 said that this would not be possible in practice or that they lacked the time and skills (‘I don’t have the knowledge for that’, P12). Choosingbetween ‘rather yes’ and ‘rather no’, sixty-nine participants said rather yes’ to giving everyone the ability to make such changes.Among those that did not want this (answering ‘rather no’), the reasons were varied and included concerns around feasibility (5%,‘it would be too hard to programme that’, P10), security (4%, ‘devices are designed to function in certain way’, P42), and the acts of others(4%, ‘they should have the independent right to change the setting on their OWN phone but it should limit to that’, P65).

25,DesireForUserRespect,constrainsAgent,Users,"To explore the space of potential user needs that might be served by an ability to extend and change the functionality of existing mobile apps, we conducted an open-ended survey with 100 partici-pants and a fictional app repair tool. We studied what individuals,if given a chance, would like to change about the apps they of-ten use concerning the user interface and underlying app logic through a speculative role-playing design prompt, similar to previous work [82]. We chose to conduct a survey to be able to scale across more individuals and elicit a more diverse range of response than we could do with other methods, such as interviews.Study Design. Our survey had three parts: 1) demographics and app use, 2) speculative role-playing design of app changes, and 3)user reflections. In the speculative design exercise, we introduced the concept of app changes through a speculative role-playing de-sign prompt, similar to previous work by Merrill [82]. We asked participants to imagine being granted two ‘app-modification su-perpowers’ by a benevolent ‘app genie’, thereby comparing app changes to magic – almost anything is possible. We then repeatedly asked participants how they would use those two superpowers to change the apps that they often use. Such repeated questioning is a commonly used method in user research to spur creativity, e.g., bySakichi Toyoda’s ‘Five Whys’ [99]. Firstly, participants were asked to make between four and seven suggestions on how to change their three most used apps (as provided in the first part of the survey).This first part is visualized in Figure ?? in the Appendix. Secondly,participants were asked to make between three and six suggestions on how to change any app on their phone. We encouraged partic-ipants to take out their phones as part of this process to help the design exercise. In total, participants would make between seven and 13 suggestions for app changes. The full survey can be found in the Appendix.Recruitment and Ethics Approval. Due to the qualitative na-ture of our survey, we did not need a large sample size to achieve saturation [60]. Therefore, we recruited 100 participants using Prolific, an online platform for research participant recruitment. We Restricted recruitment to current or past Android users (who would be more likely to be able to adopt app repair technology, due to iOSrestrictions), aged 18–40 years (to focus on those adults who spend most time with mobile devices for their day-to-day social and professional activities [106]). Participants were compensated for their time. Our departmental ethics board approved the study (approval reference CS_C1A_021_021). It took participants a median of 19.8minutes to complete the survey.Data Analysis and Sharing. For open-ended responses, we con-ducted a thematic analysis to look for underlying patterns within our dataset. Initially, we started with an inductive approach, where three authors of this paper independently developed an initial set of codes, from a different set of 100 suggested app changes. Theauthors then met and discussed the codes to achieve consensus and develop a codebook. Finally, the first author completed the coding using a deductive method, and formed themes based on the previously-identified codes. In total, we identified 29 codes, and 5 themes.3.1 Results 3.1.1 Participant Demographics. Fifty-nine participants identified as men and 40 as women. One participant did not disclose this information. Fifty-one participants resided in Poland, 21 in SouthAfrica, five in Portugal, five in Greece, four in Spain, four in Italy,and the remaining seven in other European countries (with the exception of one participant from Israel).3.1.2 Overview of Suggested App Changes. Throughout the survey,the most commonly selected apps to make modifications to wereInstagram (selected by 54 participants), Messenger (52), Facebook(49), YouTube (45), and WhatsApp (41). Participants suggested a total of 734 app changes. After a review of all changes, we excluded five responses because we did not understand them or because they did not include any changes. We also excluded another 166 suggestions that were not directly actionable or relevant for apprepair, e.g., because they pertained to changes to server-side code or were too abstract.The set of actionable and relevant app changes represents those that may actually be implemented through app repair and client-side changes. These changes related to three themes namely, i)making apps’ business models more user-friendly and respectful,ii) the wish for more attractive, user-friendly, and accessible user interfaces, and iii) rebalancing privacy and security in apps. Wedescribe each of these themes in the following.Making apps’ business models more user-friendly and respectful. In this theme, 60% of participants complained about how apps generate revenue. This was mainly related to advertising (42%of users), being the predominant monetisation model in the app ecosystem.[I would wish for] A built-in ad blocker in the browser that blocks intrusive ads (P65, Chrome)ads, ads, ads, ads, ads, ads, ads, ads, ads, ads (P65, YouTube)Beyond ads, another common monetisation model on Androidare in-app purchases. This model can, by its design, conflict with the actions that users take within apps. 4% of participants expressed such annoyance with regards to non-ad app monetisation.Less pay to win system and a better leaderboard for ranked(P56, Clash Royale) Paid options and subscriptions everywhere. It is very annoy-ing when using the app (P66, Tinder)A related category comprises patches that provide paid features for free (wished for by 19% of participants). A common concern was monetisation by YouTube, which does not allow playing videos in the background without a subscription.I would have free access to premium content because most people cannot afford it (P71, YouTube)Since such modifications might constitute fraud, they should not be developed.The wish for more attractive, user-friendly, and accessible user interfaces. Within this theme, the most common suggestions related to modifications to the user interface (UI) – mentioned by92% of participants. A common complaint was that a specific app was not ‘user-friendly’ (P22) or not ‘accessible’ (P13) enough. A Particular case of such UI improvements were cosmetic changes,e.g. to the color or theme of certain apps.The app looks very primitive and uninspired, almost unpro-fessional. (P23, about Steam) Change the app to to another color. I am getting tired of the blue bird (P1, about Twitter)Given that 39% of participants expressed such sentiments, there seems to be a rather widespread desire for self-expression and customisation in apps’ user interfaces.As for how to improve the UI, 47% of participants suggested removing certain interface elements or features. Many were unhappy with the prominently placed ‘Reels’ (P67) and ‘Stories’ (P95) in theInstagram app, the WhatsApp status page (P82), the promotion of podcasts in the Spotify app (P73), or the new TikTok-like YouTube‘Shorts’ (P32). Participants wanted to hide these elements because all of these apps do not currently provide options to do so. I hate the ""YouTube Shorts"" feature, I don’t use it at all and Idon’t find it necessary. I just don’t need it. (P32, YouTube)Have options to hide Instagram stories (P95, Instagram)Some participants complained about the metrification of social media apps and the resulting impact on individuals. Such can be present in many different forms on social media, e.g. in terms of number of friends, post views, and likes. Metrification allows users to judge the virality of social media content but can also put pressure on individuals to create and post more viral content. I would hide the amount of like when someone posts. be-cause I feel that most people just post nonsensical thing just to get likes. (P94, Twitter)15% of participants complained about forced actions, a kind of deceptive design [55], that forces individuals to take certain actions.One example is the design of Google Mail, where it is deliberately challenging to sign out only one user at a time.I would make it easier to log out and also not to log out all accounts at once. (P2, Google Mail)Another aspect that participants complained about was that Insta-gram recently replaced the ‘New Post’ button with a new button to access the new ‘Reels’ (i.e. short videos like on TikTok) – and wanted to roll back to the previous design (a class of patches mentioned by 8% of participants).Rebalancing privacy and security in apps. The last theme related to changing apps’ privacy and security practices (mentioned by 55% of participants). Users’ desire for more privacy and secu-rity in apps is well documented in the research literature, as is the relative lack of such in practice [100, 113]. Recent initiatives like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the EU and new privacy protections measures on iOS and Android have ar-guably further spurred this desire. This theme included the wish for protection from other users of the service (25%), as illustrated here:Must not allow people to take screenshots or save what others have posted on their status (P37, WhatsApp)This desire was in tension with a wish by others to more conve-niently save others’ activities (11%).Be able to save people’s videos or pictures from the app with-out the need of installing downloading app (P37, Instagram)Finally, participants expressed a need to protect their own data from the companies. 13% of participants wished for better protection of their location, and 12% of participants wanted less tracking of their activities in general and better protection from them:Ensure no data is being sent to Facebook, I dislike knowing that Whatsapp is owned by Facebook (P84, WhatsApp)Browse without cookies and no product tracking. (P1, Chrome)3.1.3 Participant Reflections. In the last survey part, we asked participants to reflect on their previous app experiences. Asked What they did in the past when they were unhappy with an app,most said that they did nothing (54%). Many researched how to fix the problem themselves (40%) or complained on social media (30%).Some reached out to app developers either in private (17%) or public(7%).

Among the remaining 15 participants(answering ‘rather no’), 7 expressed that they would not want to make changes that they find sufficiently important (‘I don’t really care that much as long as it works’, P46), while another 7 said that this would not be possible in practice or that they lacked the time and skills (‘I don’t have the knowledge for that’, P12). Choosingbetween ‘rather yes’ and ‘rather no’, sixty-nine participants said rather yes’ to giving everyone the ability to make such changes.Among those that did not want this (answering ‘rather no’), the reasons were varied and included concerns around feasibility (5%,‘it would be too hard to programme that’, P10), security (4%, ‘devices are designed to function in certain way’, P42), and the acts of others(4%, ‘they should have the independent right to change the setting on their OWN phone but it should limit to that’, P65).

28,AppRevenueModels,constrainsAgent,Users,"To explore the space of potential user needs that might be served by an ability to extend and change the functionality of existing mobile apps, we conducted an open-ended survey with 100 partici-pants and a fictional app repair tool. We studied what individuals,if given a chance, would like to change about the apps they of-ten use concerning the user interface and underlying app logic through a speculative role-playing design prompt, similar to previous work [82]. We chose to conduct a survey to be able to scale across more individuals and elicit a more diverse range of response than we could do with other methods, such as interviews.Study Design. Our survey had three parts: 1) demographics and app use, 2) speculative role-playing design of app changes, and 3)user reflections. In the speculative design exercise, we introduced the concept of app changes through a speculative role-playing de-sign prompt, similar to previous work by Merrill [82]. We asked participants to imagine being granted two ‘app-modification su-perpowers’ by a benevolent ‘app genie’, thereby comparing app changes to magic – almost anything is possible. We then repeatedly asked participants how they would use those two superpowers to change the apps that they often use. Such repeated questioning is a commonly used method in user research to spur creativity, e.g., bySakichi Toyoda’s ‘Five Whys’ [99]. Firstly, participants were asked to make between four and seven suggestions on how to change their three most used apps (as provided in the first part of the survey).This first part is visualized in Figure ?? in the Appendix. Secondly,participants were asked to make between three and six suggestions on how to change any app on their phone. We encouraged partic-ipants to take out their phones as part of this process to help the design exercise. In total, participants would make between seven and 13 suggestions for app changes. The full survey can be found in the Appendix.Recruitment and Ethics Approval. Due to the qualitative na-ture of our survey, we did not need a large sample size to achieve saturation [60]. Therefore, we recruited 100 participants using Prolific, an online platform for research participant recruitment. We Restricted recruitment to current or past Android users (who would be more likely to be able to adopt app repair technology, due to iOSrestrictions), aged 18–40 years (to focus on those adults who spend most time with mobile devices for their day-to-day social and professional activities [106]). Participants were compensated for their time. Our departmental ethics board approved the study (approval reference CS_C1A_021_021). It took participants a median of 19.8minutes to complete the survey.Data Analysis and Sharing. For open-ended responses, we con-ducted a thematic analysis to look for underlying patterns within our dataset. Initially, we started with an inductive approach, where three authors of this paper independently developed an initial set of codes, from a different set of 100 suggested app changes. Theauthors then met and discussed the codes to achieve consensus and develop a codebook. Finally, the first author completed the coding using a deductive method, and formed themes based on the previously-identified codes. In total, we identified 29 codes, and 5 themes.3.1 Results 3.1.1 Participant Demographics. Fifty-nine participants identified as men and 40 as women. One participant did not disclose this information. Fifty-one participants resided in Poland, 21 in SouthAfrica, five in Portugal, five in Greece, four in Spain, four in Italy,and the remaining seven in other European countries (with the exception of one participant from Israel).3.1.2 Overview of Suggested App Changes. Throughout the survey,the most commonly selected apps to make modifications to wereInstagram (selected by 54 participants), Messenger (52), Facebook(49), YouTube (45), and WhatsApp (41). Participants suggested a total of 734 app changes. After a review of all changes, we excluded five responses because we did not understand them or because they did not include any changes. We also excluded another 166 suggestions that were not directly actionable or relevant for apprepair, e.g., because they pertained to changes to server-side code or were too abstract.The set of actionable and relevant app changes represents those that may actually be implemented through app repair and client-side changes. These changes related to three themes namely, i)making apps’ business models more user-friendly and respectful,ii) the wish for more attractive, user-friendly, and accessible user interfaces, and iii) rebalancing privacy and security in apps. Wedescribe each of these themes in the following.Making apps’ business models more user-friendly and respectful. In this theme, 60% of participants complained about how apps generate revenue. This was mainly related to advertising (42%of users), being the predominant monetisation model in the app ecosystem.[I would wish for] A built-in ad blocker in the browser that blocks intrusive ads (P65, Chrome)ads, ads, ads, ads, ads, ads, ads, ads, ads, ads (P65, YouTube)Beyond ads, another common monetisation model on Androidare in-app purchases. This model can, by its design, conflict with the actions that users take within apps. 4% of participants expressed such annoyance with regards to non-ad app monetisation.Less pay to win system and a better leaderboard for ranked(P56, Clash Royale) Paid options and subscriptions everywhere. It is very annoy-ing when using the app (P66, Tinder)A related category comprises patches that provide paid features for free (wished for by 19% of participants). A common concern was monetisation by YouTube, which does not allow playing videos in the background without a subscription.I would have free access to premium content because most people cannot afford it (P71, YouTube)Since such modifications might constitute fraud, they should not be developed.The wish for more attractive, user-friendly, and accessible user interfaces. Within this theme, the most common suggestions related to modifications to the user interface (UI) – mentioned by92% of participants. A common complaint was that a specific app was not ‘user-friendly’ (P22) or not ‘accessible’ (P13) enough. A Particular case of such UI improvements were cosmetic changes,e.g. to the color or theme of certain apps.The app looks very primitive and uninspired, almost unpro-fessional. (P23, about Steam) Change the app to to another color. I am getting tired of the blue bird (P1, about Twitter)Given that 39% of participants expressed such sentiments, there seems to be a rather widespread desire for self-expression and customisation in apps’ user interfaces.As for how to improve the UI, 47% of participants suggested removing certain interface elements or features. Many were unhappy with the prominently placed ‘Reels’ (P67) and ‘Stories’ (P95) in theInstagram app, the WhatsApp status page (P82), the promotion of podcasts in the Spotify app (P73), or the new TikTok-like YouTube‘Shorts’ (P32). Participants wanted to hide these elements because all of these apps do not currently provide options to do so. I hate the ""YouTube Shorts"" feature, I don’t use it at all and Idon’t find it necessary. I just don’t need it. (P32, YouTube)Have options to hide Instagram stories (P95, Instagram)Some participants complained about the metrification of social media apps and the resulting impact on individuals. Such can be present in many different forms on social media, e.g. in terms of number of friends, post views, and likes. Metrification allows users to judge the virality of social media content but can also put pressure on individuals to create and post more viral content. I would hide the amount of like when someone posts. be-cause I feel that most people just post nonsensical thing just to get likes. (P94, Twitter)15% of participants complained about forced actions, a kind of deceptive design [55], that forces individuals to take certain actions.One example is the design of Google Mail, where it is deliberately challenging to sign out only one user at a time.I would make it easier to log out and also not to log out all accounts at once. (P2, Google Mail)Another aspect that participants complained about was that Insta-gram recently replaced the ‘New Post’ button with a new button to access the new ‘Reels’ (i.e. short videos like on TikTok) – and wanted to roll back to the previous design (a class of patches mentioned by 8% of participants).Rebalancing privacy and security in apps. The last theme related to changing apps’ privacy and security practices (mentioned by 55% of participants). Users’ desire for more privacy and secu-rity in apps is well documented in the research literature, as is the relative lack of such in practice [100, 113]. Recent initiatives like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the EU and new privacy protections measures on iOS and Android have ar-guably further spurred this desire. This theme included the wish for protection from other users of the service (25%), as illustrated here:Must not allow people to take screenshots or save what others have posted on their status (P37, WhatsApp)This desire was in tension with a wish by others to more conve-niently save others’ activities (11%).Be able to save people’s videos or pictures from the app with-out the need of installing downloading app (P37, Instagram)Finally, participants expressed a need to protect their own data from the companies. 13% of participants wished for better protection of their location, and 12% of participants wanted less tracking of their activities in general and better protection from them:Ensure no data is being sent to Facebook, I dislike knowing that Whatsapp is owned by Facebook (P84, WhatsApp)Browse without cookies and no product tracking. (P1, Chrome)3.1.3 Participant Reflections. In the last survey part, we asked participants to reflect on their previous app experiences. Asked What they did in the past when they were unhappy with an app,most said that they did nothing (54%). Many researched how to fix the problem themselves (40%) or complained on social media (30%).Some reached out to app developers either in private (17%) or public(7%). This suggests that many end-users are resigned to the current design of their apps. 85 participants (85%) said that the ability to make changes to their apps would be ‘rather’ useful for them.

Among the remaining 15 participants(answering ‘rather no’), 7 expressed that they would not want to make changes that they find sufficiently important (‘I don’t really care that much as long as it works’, P46), while another 7 said that this would not be possible in practice or that they lacked the time and skills (‘I don’t have the knowledge for that’, P12). Choosingbetween ‘rather yes’ and ‘rather no’, sixty-nine participants said rather yes’ to giving everyone the ability to make such changes.Among those that did not want this (answering ‘rather no’), the reasons were varied and included concerns around feasibility (5%,‘it would be too hard to programme that’, P10), security (4%, ‘devices are designed to function in certain way’, P42), and the acts of others(4%, ‘they should have the independent right to change the setting on their OWN phone but it should limit to that’, P65).
