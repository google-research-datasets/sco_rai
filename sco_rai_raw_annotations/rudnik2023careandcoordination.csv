9,CareTech,Agent,"The subject of our case study, CareTech4, is one of several start-upsthat are credited with “reinventing the [home care] agency model”[22]. Prior to data collection, CareTech acquired StayHome, a traditional home care agency franchise. To contextualize our findings,we briefly discuss CareTech’s business model.CareTech partners with traditional home care agencies to support back-end administrative, legal, compliance, and logistics functions in exchange for a share of partner agencies’ revenue, employing caregivers directly. Caregivers assist with activities of daily living(i.e., bathing, dressing, getting in or out of a bed or chair, walking,using the toilet, eating) [43], and instrumental activities of daily living (i.e., cooking, cleaning, transportation, laundry, managing finances) [46]. CareTech’s use of algorithms to match caregivers to care recipients is central to our case. When we started data collection, CareTech’s technology platform had recently been im-plemented at StayHome’s company-owned agencies, providing a unique opportunity to investigate care algorithm implementation.In this paper, we focus primarily on CareTech’s staffing prac-tices. CareTech uses metrics and algorithms, along with human management, to staff shifts. Staffing algorithms have a role at two main sites: as initial schedules were made and when other care-givers called off their shifts. When caregivers are scheduled during their onboarding, staff members at CareTech use algorithmic recommendation systems to match caregivers with care recipients. Evaluation metrics (i.e., timeliness, consistency, application usage,and call-offs), along with other data (e.g., caregiver commute time,number of complaints) are used to match caregivers and care recipients. Coordinators receive weekly surveys about the quality of care provided, and provide responses on a linear scale5. After IRB approval, we recruited participants—technologists (n =14), caregivers (n = 9), and coordinators (n = 7)—through a partnership with CareTech and StayHome for interviews using convenience and purposive sampling [10]. StayHome’s research staff arranged site visit and helped recruit participants. We provided a brief description of the study and a screening questionnaire distributed amongst the caregivers and coordinators over email. This approach provided an opportunity to learn from technologists, caregivers,coordinators who were enthusiastic about sharing their experi-ences with the platform. Table 2 and table 3 provide an overview of participant profiles.(1) Technologists: Technologists consisted of software engi-neers, designers, product managers, and data and opera-tions workers. Software engineers talked about buildingCareTech’s features and the company’s history. Designers Develop CareTech’s front-end user experience for caregivers.Designers, the operations team, and a product manager described how they approached curating the caregiver experi-ence. The data scientists, data analysts, and data stewards dis-cussed the metrics used to measure caregiver performance,the data that staffing algorithms use, and how algorithms work in practice.(2) Caregivers: We use the term ‘caregivers’ to refer to the people employed by CareTech to provide care for pay.(3) Coordinators: The term ‘coordinators’ refers to people that pay for CareTech’s services and coordinate their delivery,usually on behalf of an older loved one. Recruiting interview participants through a partnership with Stay-Home and CareTech potentially biased results toward more positive perspectives of organizational practices. Caregivers and coordina-tors with more negative views about the company may have been reluctant to share their opinions or participate in interviews alto-gether due to fears of retaliation from the platform. Convenience Sampling limited the extent to which we were able to understand differences across demographic subgroups. Future work should explore this issue. Further, recruitment overlooked the perspectives of care coordinators and caregivers who have left the platform due to difficulties This study draws on data gathered from one week of observations performed in July 2022 and 30 interviews conducted between May2022 and August 2022. We conducted in-depth interviews to understand the cultural inputs that shape algorithm design and the implications for caregivers and coordinators. Interviews are well-suited for understanding social dimensions of how people interpret the world and take actions based on those interpretations [64]. Interviews with technology workers show how they make sense of their work and build systems [67], and interviews with caregivers and coordinators show that care practices diverge from organizational philosophy [53]. After several interviews, one researcher visitedStayHome’s global headquarters and a company-owned agency,located in a major Midwestern city in the U.S. The researcher toured the company’s offices and met with support staff. In addition, theresearcher engaged these actors in informal conversations to learn how StayHome and CareTech operate. To understand how the plat-form is presented to caregivers and what aspects of paid care work are emphasized, the researcher observed a caregiver training ses-sion on lifting and transferring techniques at one of StayHome’scompany-owned franchises and attended a virtual onboarding ses-sion with CareTech in the afternoon.We developed the interview guide with interest in valuation and evaluation practices as they occur on CareTech’s platform. Treating valuation as a moral outlook, we drew on practice-oriented approaches to understanding how different actors conceptualize and contribute value in labor contexts [36]. Examining the practices of the people that develop platforms and those who are subject to their architecture provides an opportunity to identify the underlying justifications and actions that shape and transform care work as it occurs on the ground. Interview questions thus sought to elicit interviewees' daily practices, what elements of their work they described as most important, the least favorite aspects of their work,and their ideological orientation towards the concept of ‘care.’After obtaining consent, we recorded the interviews, which lasted between 45 and 90 minutes and took place mainly over Zoom. However, we did interview several caregivers and one coordinator in person. Team members iteratively refined these themes through discussion and mapped them to the EoW framework. We used a third-party qualitative coding tool (NVivo) to complete the coding process. To make theoretical sense of the data, we returned to the literature and iterated between data and extant research. Our findings indicate that technologists drew on several economies of worth—which we refer to as moral frameworks—to navigate the seemingly irreconcilable demands of home care. They referenced multiple interpretations of the term ‘care’ to resolve contradictions.We illustrate this point by first focusing on how technologists described the problems that they claim to solve. Then, we analyze the nature of the solutions they presented, highlighting how technolo-gists imbued different aspects of algorithm design and function with moral meanings. This finding demonstrates the interpretive flexibil-ity of technological artifacts. Finally, we turn to the perspectives of caregivers and coordinators. Their accounts show how algorithmic staffing practices created new forms of uncertainty—the mirror of technologists' stated intentions.4.1 Navigating Contextual ComplexityTechnologists drew on multiple moral frameworks to navigate expectations and demands, appealing to various interpretations of care’ to reconcile the contradictory pressures they face. The technologists we interviewed framed CareTech as a platform developed to address traditional home care agencies’ logistical and opera-tional challenges. In this context, they appealed to an industrial moral framework, framing their work as introducing greater levels of efficiency and rationalization to the home care industry. How-ever, many of the technologists we interviewed also framed their work in terms of a civic moral framework, critiquing prior staffing practices as subjective, opaque, unfair, and harmful to the material well-being of caregivers. Although these two narratives may appear contradictory, technologists unified these demands by appealing to the societal need for more care. For example, improvements inefficiency were discussed in terms of increasing the affordability of care while improving working conditions was imagined as growing the size of the caregiving workforce. We argue that technologists navigate complexity when creating and developing care algorithms by strategically appealing to justifications corresponding to differ-ent moral frameworks, drawing on multiple interpretations of a single term to move between them. Throughout this section, we draw attention to how technologists position algorithmic staffing practices as one solution to the problems they described.4.1.1 Platform Description & Motivations. The rhetoric that tech-nologists and company executives used to describe their motivation for building the platform appealed to domestic and social goods. In press releases and on the company website, CareTech’s execu-tives described their frustrations in searching for care for their own parents. Similarly, technologists invoked ideas of familial respon-sibility, relaying stories about their difficulties in finding care for aging parents. Technologists also drew on more civic-oriented no-tions of good, framing their work with reference to positive social change. For example, Richard described, “being part of something that can have a positive impact on society.” The company’s mission statement, was described as ‘improving care in society6, highlight-ing the significance of a single moral concept in technologists discourse.In discussing the company’s strategy, the technologists we in-terviewed described CareTech as a “platform,” “communication company,” or “logistical engine,”, foregrounding CareTech’s use of digital technology to improve efficiency, and framed their work asa response to logistical challenges in the home care industry. Aiden described what he framed as the company’s main value proposition:I think the big sort of sell is, it is getting harder and harder to operate care. I think it is getting more expensive...the core value proposition is where we are trying to figure out how to build a platform around doing this, and helping agencies focus more on their relationships with their communities and customers.He elaborated that, by centralizing operations, CareTech offers partner agencies relief from work that is “consuming and grueling,whether it’s paperwork, management, documentation, staffing, lo-gistics, or being on call all the time.” By filling this role, CareTech‘frees up agencies to both source customers and maintain that rela-tionship and kind of connection’ (Aiden). Repeated references to the relationship between CareTech and the agencies with which it partners serve two purposes. First, they identify areas whereCareTech uses technology to increase efficiency in the home care industry. This problem formulation provides the background for how organizational solutions are framed. Second, they format a division of labor. In this account, partner agencies are positioned as responsible for managing relationships in local markets, while the platform oversees aspects of labor control and management.Here, technologists frame the platform’s work in industrial terms and partner agencies in domestic terms. 4.1.2 Staffing Practices as Solutions. As they justified their work,technologists also blended elements from multiple moral frame-works. Specifically, they simultaneously appealed to notions of market dominance and civic responsibility. This overlap materialized as Robert, a data scientist, stated that the company’s scale offered a ‘unified view across markets’ and provided access to a sufficient amount of data to use statistical techniques to ‘learn from the data to provide better home care’, serving as a “competitive dif-ferentiator in the market.” In addition, Floyd framed the company's size as affording more ‘careful’ staffing practice:From a systemic perspective, when you are bigger you have these systems in place, and you do not have to guilt somebody into working a shift. If you need a shift filled, you have a stable of hundreds of caregivers you can reach out to, it is just a matter of how much bonus you have to put on it.These rhetorical strategies demonstrate how technologists draw on multiple moral frameworks to present their work as solutions to different problems.Building on discussions of CareTech’s organizational strategy,technologists most concretely articulated their efforts toward ‘im-proving care in society’ through labor management. They started these discussions by problematizing caregiver job quality under legacy home care practices as associated with low wages, few ben-efits, rigid scheduling practices, and little recognition of caregivers efforts. Kennedy critiqued legacy staffing practices on the grounds of fairness and transparency:There’s a lot of favoritism that happens. There’s a lack of transparency. And so as you can imagine, the caregivers who work the most shifts, they’re able to earn the most amount of money. And that’s really helping to improve their lives and livelihoods. Other technologists framed algorithmic staffing as a solution to the legacy staffing practices that Kennedy identified as opaque and unfair. While Kennedy incorporated concerns about material well-being into her critiques, other technologists generally avoided discussing their efforts toward increasing caregiver job quality in terms of a market-based moral framework. This may have resulted from the market constraints of care, where the price for private pay home care is inaccessible for many families. Aria explainedthat raising wages for caregivers would make the price of care“unpayable” by many clients. 4.1.3 Professionalizing Care. Instead, technologists framed their efforts as attempts to improve caregivers’ status and provide them with a career. Aria noted that improving the collective status of caregivers was part of CareTech’s mission since its founding, em-phasizing challenging aspects of the job:I think that a really big piece of what CareTech is try-ing to do and has been trying to do since the beginning you know, elevate the profession of caregiving. Andtruly treat it a profession instead of just a job...because it's a difficult, emotionally intense, sometimes physi-cally intense thing to do.Floyd described further aspirations to elevate caregivers’ status through professionalization:I would say that [career] is a north star for us. I think everyone views that as an innovation that we can and should make, and the profession is worth it... we're working towards it, but we haven’t actually gotten there yet.These discussions highlight the links that technologists establish between different moral frameworks as they respond to a complex set of challenges. While they expressed concern about the value that care holds in society, increasing the pecuniary value of car was viewed as infeasible. Technologists responded to this problem by appealing to the status of the profession. However, technologists most defined solutions came in the form of staffing algorithms.4.2 Datafying CareWe unpack staffing practices at CareTech, which we argue are emblematic of technological solutionism. Our analysis reveals that technologists associated different aspects of staffing algorithms with different moral frameworks. We argue that how decisions are made about who is best suited for particular shifts—and why—is changing with the advent and implementation of algorithmic staffing tools as technologists prioritize efficiency. However, discussions with technologists show that there are tensions present in the use of algorithms. On the one hand, technologists discussed their work in terms of trying to increase caregiver performance. Performance Evaluation metrics break care into a set of constituent elements closely aligned with operational efficiency (an appeal to the indus-trial moral framework). On the other hand, technologists described their work as oriented toward establishing long-term relationships between caregivers and care recipients (an appeal to the domestic moral framework).The metrics and measurements that support algorithmic staffing practices are most closely associated with notions of productivity and operational efficiency. Technologists presented one part of their work as oriented toward increasing the “performance, or perceived performance of the caregiver” (Floyd). They described how this work is accomplished by measuring: (1) timeliness (how frequently a caregiver arrives to a shift on time); (2) consistency (adherence to schedule shifts); (3) application usage (whether or not the caregiver uses the application to clock in to and out of shifts and evaluate care recipient well-being); and (4) call-offs (shifts not released seven days in advance). While this evaluation practice makes care legible based on a discrete set of metrics, the composition of these metrics is oriented toward operational efficiency rather than the experiences of care recipients or care coordinators.Technologists contrasted their work with platforms in the ride-hailing industry7, describing how their work was motivated by the desire to establish long-term relationships between caregivers and care recipients. They referenced algorithms in terms that framed care as a holistic practice, often comparing the product of their work to other intimate relationships. Staffing algorithms have a role at two main sites: as initial schedules were made and when other caregivers called off their shifts. When caregivers are scheduled during their onboarding, staff members at CareTech use algorithmic recommendation systems to match caregivers with care recipients.In both cases, platform architects compared the matching process to other intimate relations between caregivers and care recipients.In Sandra’s words: Once the data are all collected, [the algorithm] gives us a list of caregivers, and it was ranked by most likely to be picked up by the caregiver...there is a...I don't want to say negotiating, but there are conversations that go back and forth. Because it does become an arranged marriage when you’re putting it inside thehome.In instances where shifts opened up with clients, the platform gives caregivers the option to pick up shifts with these clients through a user interface that Floyd described as “not not tinder 8 inspired. In advancing these relationship-based arguments, technologists define quality care by referencing domestic relationships between caregivers and care recipients.On the one hand, technologists seek to build a platform that effi-ciently delivers consistent care to a growing number of older adult care recipients. On the other, they describe their work as motivated by a desire to optimize relationships between caregivers and care recipients. At the same time, they framed their efforts as improving fairness, accountability, and transparency in staffing practices. Pair-ing discussions of metrics—which break care down into constituent elements associated with industrial efficiency—with algorithms staffing practices—which technologists use to frame evaluation in domestic terms—reveals that these actors associate different parts of their job with distinct moral frameworks to meet a complex set of demands. Further, interviews with caregivers and coordinators reveal that these performance evaluation criteria and platform staffing practices are a source of tension and stress.4.3 Platform AsymmetriesWhat are the consequences of technologists’ actions? To answer this question, we turn to platform caregivers’ and care coordinators’ per-spectives and experiences. Contrary to technologists’ aspirations touse algorithms to build a fairer, more transparent order, algorithmic staffing practices in fact created new conditions of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. First, we focus on evaluation practices.CareTech’s app for caregivers displays ratings across several met-rics related to operational aspects of care delivery (i.e., timeliness,consistency, application usage, and call-offs). The platform also sends weekly caregiver evaluation surveys to coordinators but does not share this feedback directly with caregivers. Further, caregivers rarely received qualitative feedback regarding the quality of care they provided. Caregivers discussed how these aspects of platform design contributed to ambiguity regarding insight into their perfor-mance, while coordinators approached completing survey-based caregiver evaluations with ambivalence. Second, we analyze care-givers’ interactions with CareTech’s staffing practices. Caregivers described experiencing collapsed boundaries between working and personal time. Despite these new challenges, the caregivers and coordinators we interviewed did not mention a desire to leave. .4.3.1 Ambiguity and Ambivalence. While caregivers described providing care as meaningful and were generally content with the conditions they faced on the platform, they discussed a lack of clarity regarding expectations and performance. As Hayden said:I believe that the clients, they also rate us after every shift. So then if we get rated lowly every time or pretty consistently, I’m sure they will reach out tous...I don’t know that it helps us rate our care and how well we’re doing with our clients, but I don't know how else they could do that...you hear stories of people who are dissatisfied with their care, and that's hard to tell.It was only after connecting with other caregivers that Hayden Learned that it was possible to request a performance evaluation form CareTech. Further, the opacity of metrics created feelings of worry for care-givers about their performance. As a new caregiver on the platform,Hazel worried about a low client consistency rating and discussed needing to take the initiative to understand why she received low ratings across other metrics. Puzzled about low application usage ratings, Hazel described needing to reach out to CareTech to understand “what [she] was missing.” CareTech’s communication and evaluation practices created unclear situations with multiple interpretations and required additional labor on the part of caregivers to understand how care recipients experienced their care and how the platform judged their performance. Coordinators, on the other hand, discussed their own evaluation practices as infused with ambivalence—a finding that we found surprising given the intimate and impactful context of care for an older loved one. While coordinators described clear feelings about the care provided to loved ones, our interviewees responded to CareTech’s evaluation surveys inconsistently. Coordinators expressed satisfaction with the care that caregivers provided and thus did not feel a need to fill out the company’s weekly care-giver evaluation survey, described how these surveys were not as useful compared to in-person evaluations performed over more extended periods, or expressed that they did not feel their feedback through these outlets was listened to by CareTech. Phyllis—who lives with her care recipient—described that since the quality of care was so consistent, there was not a need to be very detailed in her evaluations: “they will send out those [surveys] weekly...soyou click on attentiveness, preparation, and I don’t remember what they all are. There’s about five of them. I don’t get very detailed.” On The other hand, Brooks—who did not live with his care recipient,and was dissatisfied with the consistency of staffing provided byCareTech—described feeling overwhelmed by the amount of eval-uating he was asked to do: “For each one of the caregivers that has been in, they’re asking for an opinion for eight to 10 caregivers everyMonday, on the same thing, the same people doing the same thing.I’ve had a hard time seeing the value on a weekly basis.” He saw more value in evaluations carried out over longer intervals as it had been before the acquisition. There used to be the quarterly report where they would actually go in and visit and come back and say,‘this has changed, or this looks like it’s changed’...when someone steps in four or five times a year those are the ones that can pick out some things.Opal, who uses CareTech to provide care to her husband, discussed her attitude towards the surveys: “Honestly, I ignore [the surveys]. It’s not something I want to do. I don’t know why. I know they're doing great.” These perspectives demonstrate a difference in the worth actors ascribed to particular evaluation practices, high-lighting a mismatch between technologists’, coordinators’, and care-givers’ perspectives. Other coordinators described non-use of CareTech’s evaluation infrastructure, even when there were striking departures from care expectations. Coordinators justified their approach by appealing to different moral frameworks. Riley said, “what did happen onetime, and I should probably be more tuned into it...there was one day when one of the caregivers didn’t show up at all. And I didn't know about it until the next day.” She justified the non-use through appeals to a domestic moral framework: “I’m not as hands-on, I’mnot looking at the app to see what they’re doing. I get my feedback on how they’re doing from my mom and dad.” Winnie, who relied on a caregiver to transport her mother to church on Sunday mornings, described situations where sometimes a caregiver assigned to the shift couldn’t drive or had no car. Even so, she did not fill out regular surveys, drawing on her experience as a business owner (industrial)to express that she understood the challenges of staffing shifts: “it’sa very hard thing to maneuver in the world that we’re walking in. We Own a small business. We employ 13 ladies, so I understand.” At the same time, she seemed to negatively moralize non-use: “I will be honest with you that a survey has come...I haven’t filled it out. So I Haven't done due diligence on my part. You know, so I’m going to own that part.” While some coordinators expressed frustration about consistency, communication, quality, and the efficacy of evaluation practices, they appealed to multiple moral frameworks to justify different uses of evaluation infrastructure.4.3.2 Work Practices and Professional Boundaries. Continued dis-cussion with caregivers provided insight into how the problems that technologists faced contributed to aspects of platform design.The need to fill open shifts and coordinate care work across multiple individuals—associated with an industrial moral framework—took precedence over other concerns. Francine’s account of interactions with CareTech provides an example of how the need to staff shifts devalued communication about performance: “they have never given me any feedback or evaluation, the only time they call is about the schedule, asking if you can work more.” We argue that technologists prioritization of needs associated with the industrial moral frame-work eroded the boundary between caregivers’ work and personal lives and changed care practices.For example, the platform uses a notification system to bring open shifts to caregivers’ attention. However, Pepper describe how the constant notification stream makes it difficult for her to differentiate between work and leisure time:I can tell they have a lot of shifts to fill in. Am I go-ing to be under pressure? They’ve asked me for five things, and you said no to all of them, it feels likeI should say yes to something now. It’s just a little harder to be either working or not working...when you see your phone in the morning and you see all those notifications there.Hayden described receiving “30 to 40” notifications a day from the app, even after reaching out to CareTech to express that they would not work any more shifts. Further, they described confu-sion and frustration regarding the processes by which shifts were initially assigned:I actually said no to [the shift], but they scheduled me anyway. Which was how I got a lot of my shifts,which was okay...I know sometimes it sounds weird,but I would say no to a shift, maybe they’d think thatI said yes.This account suggests that the platform does not allow for as much flexibility as technologists imagine.In contrast to legacy record-keeping procedures, where care-givers left paper-based care notes in clients’ homes, CareTech’splatform requires that caregivers describe their shifts upon clock-ing out in an electronic journal that is viewable by coordinators and other caregivers. While caregivers described that the journal helped them feel more prepared for each shift, they also described reading journal entries outside of working hours, which provided further evidence for blurred boundaries between work and personal life.For example, Chauncey described reading entries “at night, before Igo to bed, I start reading if I’m going to work the next morning.” In Addition, platform architecture requiring caregivers to complete these logs changed caregivers’ relationship to time spent on the job. Francine described how filling out the notes, especially in the time-sensitive context of a shift, placed pressure on how she spent time providing care: “if you clock out right at a minute after [your shift ends] they get you on that.” Efforts to avoid disciplinary action created new relationships to time: “I just always try to clock out a few minutes before because you get all these questions before closing out the app” (Francine). In these cases, platform architecture changed caregivers' relationships with their time both on and off the clock,which put caregivers under additional pressure.We found that aspects of platform and algorithm design create new forms of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. We argue that this results from a mismatch between technologists’ moral reasoning and that of other platform actors. In addition, the need to fill open shifts and coordinate work across many individuals pri-oritizes a logic of efficiency over concerns for caregiver job quality.Despite coordinators’ unmet expectations and new pressures that the platform placed on caregivers, both sets of actors maintain a commitment to the platform. A possible explanation for contin-ued attachment is the moral significance of ‘care.’ While the term carries various meanings across actors and situations, it may act as a resource that maintains a particular status quo by mitigating organized critique of or departure from the platform.

The rhetoric that tech-nologists and company executives used to describe their motivation for building the platform appealed to domestic and social goods. In press releases and on the company website, CareTech’s execu-tives described their frustrations in searching for care for their own parents. Similarly, technologists invoked ideas of familial respon-sibility, relaying stories about their difficulties in finding care for aging parents. Technologists also drew on more civic-oriented no-tions of good, framing their work with reference to positive social change. For example, Richard described, “being part of something that can have a positive impact on society.” The company’s mission statement, was described as ‘improving care in society6, highlight-ing the significance of a single moral concept in technologists discourse.In discussing the company’s strategy, the technologists we in-terviewed described CareTech as a “platform,” “communication company,” or “logistical engine,”, foregrounding CareTech’s use of digital technology to improve efficiency, and framed their work asa response to logistical challenges in the home care industry. Aiden described what he framed as the company’s main value proposition:I think the big sort of sell is, it is getting harder and harder to operate care. I think it is getting more expensive...the core value proposition is where we are trying to figure out how to build a platform around doing this, and helping agencies focus more on their relationships with their communities and customers.He elaborated that, by centralizing operations, CareTech offers partner agencies relief from work that is “consuming and grueling,whether it’s paperwork, management, documentation, staffing, lo-gistics, or being on call all the time.” By filling this role, CareTech‘frees up agencies to both source customers and maintain that rela-tionship and kind of connection’ (Aiden). Repeated references to the relationship between CareTech and the agencies with which it partners serve two purposes. First, they identify areas whereCareTech uses technology to increase efficiency in the home care industry. This problem formulation provides the background for how organizational solutions are framed. Second, they format a division of labor. In this account, partner agencies are positioned as responsible for managing relationships in local markets, while the platform oversees aspects of labor control and management.Here, technologists frame the platform’s work in industrial terms and partner agencies in domestic terms. 4.1.2 Staffing Practices as Solutions. As they justified their work,technologists also blended elements from multiple moral frame-works. Specifically, they simultaneously appealed to notions of market dominance and civic responsibility. This overlap materialized as Robert, a data scientist, stated that the company’s scale offered a ‘unified view across markets’ and provided access to a sufficient amount of data to use statistical techniques to ‘learn from the data to provide better home care’, serving as a “competitive dif-ferentiator in the market.” In addition, Floyd framed the company's size as affording more ‘careful’ staffing practice:From a systemic perspective, when you are bigger you have these systems in place, and you do not have to guilt somebody into working a shift. If you need a shift filled, you have a stable of hundreds of caregivers you can reach out to, it is just a matter of how much bonus you have to put on it.These rhetorical strategies demonstrate how technologists draw on multiple moral frameworks to present their work as solutions to different problems.Building on discussions of CareTech’s organizational strategy,technologists most concretely articulated their efforts toward ‘im-proving care in society’ through labor management. They started these discussions by problematizing caregiver job quality under legacy home care practices as associated with low wages, few ben-efits, rigid scheduling practices, and little recognition of caregivers efforts. Kennedy critiqued legacy staffing practices on the grounds of fairness and transparency:There’s a lot of favoritism that happens. There’s a lack of transparency. And so as you can imagine, the caregivers who work the most shifts, they’re able to earn the most amount of money. And that’s really helping to improve their lives and livelihoods. Other technologists framed algorithmic staffing as a solution to the legacy staffing practices that Kennedy identified as opaque and unfair. While Kennedy incorporated concerns about material well-being into her critiques, other technologists generally avoided discussing their efforts toward increasing caregiver job quality in terms of a market-based moral framework. This may have resulted from the market constraints of care, where the price for private pay home care is inaccessible for many families. Aria explainedthat raising wages for caregivers would make the price of care“unpayable” by many clients. 4.1.3 Professionalizing Care. Instead, technologists framed their efforts as attempts to improve caregivers’ status and provide them with a career. Aria noted that improving the collective status of caregivers was part of CareTech’s mission since its founding, em-phasizing challenging aspects of the job:I think that a really big piece of what CareTech is try-ing to do and has been trying to do since the beginning you know, elevate the profession of caregiving. Andtruly treat it a profession instead of just a job...because it's a difficult, emotionally intense, sometimes physi-cally intense thing to do.Floyd described further aspirations to elevate caregivers’ status through professionalization:I would say that [career] is a north star for us. I think everyone views that as an innovation that we can and should make, and the profession is worth it... we're working towards it, but we haven’t actually gotten there yet.These discussions highlight the links that technologists establish between different moral frameworks as they respond to a complex set of challenges. While they expressed concern about the value that care holds in society, increasing the pecuniary value of car was viewed as infeasible. Technologists responded to this problem by appealing to the status of the profession. However, technologists most defined solutions came in the form of staffing algorithms.4.2 Datafying CareWe unpack staffing practices at CareTech, which we argue are emblematic of technological solutionism. Our analysis reveals that technologists associated different aspects of staffing algorithms with different moral frameworks. We argue that how decisions are made about who is best suited for particular shifts—and why—is changing with the advent and implementation of algorithmic staffing tools as technologists prioritize efficiency. However, discussions with technologists show that there are tensions present in the use of algorithms. On the one hand, technologists discussed their work in terms of trying to increase caregiver performance. Performance Evaluation metrics break care into a set of constituent elements closely aligned with operational efficiency (an appeal to the indus-trial moral framework). On the other hand, technologists described their work as oriented toward establishing long-term relationships between caregivers and care recipients (an appeal to the domestic moral framework).The metrics and measurements that support algorithmic staffing practices are most closely associated with notions of productivity and operational efficiency. Technologists presented one part of their work as oriented toward increasing the “performance, or perceived performance of the caregiver” (Floyd). They described how this work is accomplished by measuring: (1) timeliness (how frequently a caregiver arrives to a shift on time); (2) consistency (adherence to schedule shifts); (3) application usage (whether or not the caregiver uses the application to clock in to and out of shifts and evaluate care recipient well-being); and (4) call-offs (shifts not released seven days in advance). While this evaluation practice makes care legible based on a discrete set of metrics, the composition of these metrics is oriented toward operational efficiency rather than the experiences of care recipients or care coordinators.Technologists contrasted their work with platforms in the ride-hailing industry7, describing how their work was motivated by the desire to establish long-term relationships between caregivers and care recipients. They referenced algorithms in terms that framed care as a holistic practice, often comparing the product of their work to other intimate relationships. Staffing algorithms have a role at two main sites: as initial schedules were made and when other caregivers called off their shifts. When caregivers are scheduled during their onboarding, staff members at CareTech use algorithmic recommendation systems to match caregivers with care recipients.In both cases, platform architects compared the matching process to other intimate relations between caregivers and care recipients.In Sandra’s words: Once the data are all collected, [the algorithm] gives us a list of caregivers, and it was ranked by most likely to be picked up by the caregiver...there is a...I don't want to say negotiating, but there are conversations that go back and forth. Because it does become an arranged marriage when you’re putting it inside thehome.In instances where shifts opened up with clients, the platform gives caregivers the option to pick up shifts with these clients through a user interface that Floyd described as “not not tinder 8 inspired. In advancing these relationship-based arguments, technologists define quality care by referencing domestic relationships between caregivers and care recipients.On the one hand, technologists seek to build a platform that effi-ciently delivers consistent care to a growing number of older adult care recipients. On the other, they describe their work as motivated by a desire to optimize relationships between caregivers and care recipients. At the same time, they framed their efforts as improving fairness, accountability, and transparency in staffing practices. Pair-ing discussions of metrics—which break care down into constituent elements associated with industrial efficiency—with algorithms staffing practices—which technologists use to frame evaluation in domestic terms—reveals that these actors associate different parts of their job with distinct moral frameworks to meet a complex set of demands. Further, interviews with caregivers and coordinators reveal that these performance evaluation criteria and platform staffing practices are a source of tension and stress.4.3 Platform AsymmetriesWhat are the consequences of technologists’ actions? To answer this question, we turn to platform caregivers’ and care coordinators’ per-spectives and experiences. Contrary to technologists’ aspirations touse algorithms to build a fairer, more transparent order, algorithmic staffing practices in fact created new conditions of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. First, we focus on evaluation practices.CareTech’s app for caregivers displays ratings across several met-rics related to operational aspects of care delivery (i.e., timeliness,consistency, application usage, and call-offs). The platform also sends weekly caregiver evaluation surveys to coordinators but does not share this feedback directly with caregivers. Further, caregivers rarely received qualitative feedback regarding the quality of care they provided. Caregivers discussed how these aspects of platform design contributed to ambiguity regarding insight into their perfor-mance, while coordinators approached completing survey-based caregiver evaluations with ambivalence. Second, we analyze care-givers’ interactions with CareTech’s staffing practices. Caregivers described experiencing collapsed boundaries between working and personal time. Despite these new challenges, the caregivers and coordinators we interviewed did not mention a desire to leave. .4.3.1 Ambiguity and Ambivalence. While caregivers described providing care as meaningful and were generally content with the conditions they faced on the platform, they discussed a lack of clarity regarding expectations and performance. As Hayden said:I believe that the clients, they also rate us after every shift. So then if we get rated lowly every time or pretty consistently, I’m sure they will reach out tous...I don’t know that it helps us rate our care and how well we’re doing with our clients, but I don't know how else they could do that...you hear stories of people who are dissatisfied with their care, and that's hard to tell.It was only after connecting with other caregivers that Hayden Learned that it was possible to request a performance evaluation form CareTech. Further, the opacity of metrics created feelings of worry for care-givers about their performance. As a new caregiver on the platform,Hazel worried about a low client consistency rating and discussed needing to take the initiative to understand why she received low ratings across other metrics. Puzzled about low application usage ratings, Hazel described needing to reach out to CareTech to understand “what [she] was missing.” CareTech’s communication and evaluation practices created unclear situations with multiple interpretations and required additional labor on the part of caregivers to understand how care recipients experienced their care and how the platform judged their performance. Coordinators, on the other hand, discussed their own evaluation practices as infused with ambivalence—a finding that we found surprising given the intimate and impactful context of care for an older loved one. While coordinators described clear feelings about the care provided to loved ones, our interviewees responded to CareTech’s evaluation surveys inconsistently. Coordinators expressed satisfaction with the care that caregivers provided and thus did not feel a need to fill out the company’s weekly care-giver evaluation survey, described how these surveys were not as useful compared to in-person evaluations performed over more extended periods, or expressed that they did not feel their feedback through these outlets was listened to by CareTech. Phyllis—who lives with her care recipient—described that since the quality of care was so consistent, there was not a need to be very detailed in her evaluations: “they will send out those [surveys] weekly...soyou click on attentiveness, preparation, and I don’t remember what they all are. There’s about five of them. I don’t get very detailed.” On The other hand, Brooks—who did not live with his care recipient,and was dissatisfied with the consistency of staffing provided byCareTech—described feeling overwhelmed by the amount of eval-uating he was asked to do: “For each one of the caregivers that has been in, they’re asking for an opinion for eight to 10 caregivers everyMonday, on the same thing, the same people doing the same thing.I’ve had a hard time seeing the value on a weekly basis.” He saw more value in evaluations carried out over longer intervals as it had been before the acquisition. There used to be the quarterly report where they would actually go in and visit and come back and say,‘this has changed, or this looks like it’s changed’...when someone steps in four or five times a year those are the ones that can pick out some things.Opal, who uses CareTech to provide care to her husband, discussed her attitude towards the surveys: “Honestly, I ignore [the surveys]. It’s not something I want to do. I don’t know why. I know they're doing great.” These perspectives demonstrate a difference in the worth actors ascribed to particular evaluation practices, high-lighting a mismatch between technologists’, coordinators’, and care-givers’ perspectives. Other coordinators described non-use of CareTech’s evaluation infrastructure, even when there were striking departures from care expectations. Coordinators justified their approach by appealing to different moral frameworks. Riley said, “what did happen onetime, and I should probably be more tuned into it...there was one day when one of the caregivers didn’t show up at all. And I didn't know about it until the next day.” She justified the non-use through appeals to a domestic moral framework: “I’m not as hands-on, I’mnot looking at the app to see what they’re doing. I get my feedback on how they’re doing from my mom and dad.” Winnie, who relied on a caregiver to transport her mother to church on Sunday mornings, described situations where sometimes a caregiver assigned to the shift couldn’t drive or had no car. Even so, she did not fill out regular surveys, drawing on her experience as a business owner (industrial)to express that she understood the challenges of staffing shifts: “it’sa very hard thing to maneuver in the world that we’re walking in. We Own a small business. We employ 13 ladies, so I understand.” At the same time, she seemed to negatively moralize non-use: “I will be honest with you that a survey has come...I haven’t filled it out. So I Haven't done due diligence on my part. You know, so I’m going to own that part.” While some coordinators expressed frustration about consistency, communication, quality, and the efficacy of evaluation practices, they appealed to multiple moral frameworks to justify different uses of evaluation infrastructure.4.3.2 Work Practices and Professional Boundaries. Continued dis-cussion with caregivers provided insight into how the problems that technologists faced contributed to aspects of platform design.The need to fill open shifts and coordinate care work across multiple individuals—associated with an industrial moral framework—took precedence over other concerns. Francine’s account of interactions with CareTech provides an example of how the need to staff shifts devalued communication about performance: “they have never given me any feedback or evaluation, the only time they call is about the schedule, asking if you can work more.” We argue that technologists prioritization of needs associated with the industrial moral frame-work eroded the boundary between caregivers’ work and personal lives and changed care practices.For example, the platform uses a notification system to bring open shifts to caregivers’ attention. However, Pepper describe how the constant notification stream makes it difficult for her to differentiate between work and leisure time:I can tell they have a lot of shifts to fill in. Am I go-ing to be under pressure? They’ve asked me for five things, and you said no to all of them, it feels likeI should say yes to something now. It’s just a little harder to be either working or not working...when you see your phone in the morning and you see all those notifications there.Hayden described receiving “30 to 40” notifications a day from the app, even after reaching out to CareTech to express that they would not work any more shifts. Further, they described confu-sion and frustration regarding the processes by which shifts were initially assigned:I actually said no to [the shift], but they scheduled me anyway. Which was how I got a lot of my shifts,which was okay...I know sometimes it sounds weird,but I would say no to a shift, maybe they’d think thatI said yes.This account suggests that the platform does not allow for as much flexibility as technologists imagine.In contrast to legacy record-keeping procedures, where care-givers left paper-based care notes in clients’ homes, CareTech’splatform requires that caregivers describe their shifts upon clock-ing out in an electronic journal that is viewable by coordinators and other caregivers. While caregivers described that the journal helped them feel more prepared for each shift, they also described reading journal entries outside of working hours, which provided further evidence for blurred boundaries between work and personal life.For example, Chauncey described reading entries “at night, before Igo to bed, I start reading if I’m going to work the next morning.” In Addition, platform architecture requiring caregivers to complete these logs changed caregivers’ relationship to time spent on the job. Francine described how filling out the notes, especially in the time-sensitive context of a shift, placed pressure on how she spent time providing care: “if you clock out right at a minute after [your shift ends] they get you on that.” Efforts to avoid disciplinary action created new relationships to time: “I just always try to clock out a few minutes before because you get all these questions before closing out the app” (Francine). In these cases, platform architecture changed caregivers' relationships with their time both on and off the clock,which put caregivers under additional pressure.We found that aspects of platform and algorithm design create new forms of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. We argue that this results from a mismatch between technologists’ moral reasoning and that of other platform actors. In addition, the need to fill open shifts and coordinate work across many individuals pri-oritizes a logic of efficiency over concerns for caregiver job quality.Despite coordinators’ unmet expectations and new pressures that the platform placed on caregivers, both sets of actors maintain a commitment to the platform. A possible explanation for contin-ued attachment is the moral significance of ‘care.’ While the term carries various meanings across actors and situations, it may act as a resource that maintains a particular status quo by mitigating organized critique of or departure from the platform.

11,Caregivers,Agent,"The subject of our case study, CareTech4, is one of several start-upsthat are credited with “reinventing the [home care] agency model”[22]. Prior to data collection, CareTech acquired StayHome, a traditional home care agency franchise. To contextualize our findings,we briefly discuss CareTech’s business model.CareTech partners with traditional home care agencies to support back-end administrative, legal, compliance, and logistics functions in exchange for a share of partner agencies’ revenue, employing caregivers directly. Caregivers assist with activities of daily living(i.e., bathing, dressing, getting in or out of a bed or chair, walking,using the toilet, eating) [43], and instrumental activities of daily living (i.e., cooking, cleaning, transportation, laundry, managing finances) [46]. CareTech’s use of algorithms to match caregivers to care recipients is central to our case. When we started data collection, CareTech’s technology platform had recently been im-plemented at StayHome’s company-owned agencies, providing a unique opportunity to investigate care algorithm implementation.In this paper, we focus primarily on CareTech’s staffing prac-tices. CareTech uses metrics and algorithms, along with human management, to staff shifts. Staffing algorithms have a role at two main sites: as initial schedules were made and when other care-givers called off their shifts. When caregivers are scheduled during their onboarding, staff members at CareTech use algorithmic recommendation systems to match caregivers with care recipients. Evaluation metrics (i.e., timeliness, consistency, application usage,and call-offs), along with other data (e.g., caregiver commute time,number of complaints) are used to match caregivers and care recipients. Coordinators receive weekly surveys about the quality of care provided, and provide responses on a linear scale5. After IRB approval, we recruited participants—technologists (n =14), caregivers (n = 9), and coordinators (n = 7)—through a partnership with CareTech and StayHome for interviews using convenience and purposive sampling [10]. StayHome’s research staff arranged site visit and helped recruit participants. We provided a brief description of the study and a screening questionnaire distributed amongst the caregivers and coordinators over email. This approach provided an opportunity to learn from technologists, caregivers,coordinators who were enthusiastic about sharing their experi-ences with the platform. Table 2 and table 3 provide an overview of participant profiles.(1) Technologists: Technologists consisted of software engi-neers, designers, product managers, and data and opera-tions workers. Software engineers talked about buildingCareTech’s features and the company’s history. Designers Develop CareTech’s front-end user experience for caregivers.Designers, the operations team, and a product manager described how they approached curating the caregiver experi-ence. The data scientists, data analysts, and data stewards dis-cussed the metrics used to measure caregiver performance,the data that staffing algorithms use, and how algorithms work in practice.(2) Caregivers: We use the term ‘caregivers’ to refer to the people employed by CareTech to provide care for pay.(3) Coordinators: The term ‘coordinators’ refers to people that pay for CareTech’s services and coordinate their delivery,usually on behalf of an older loved one. Recruiting interview participants through a partnership with Stay-Home and CareTech potentially biased results toward more positive perspectives of organizational practices. Caregivers and coordina-tors with more negative views about the company may have been reluctant to share their opinions or participate in interviews alto-gether due to fears of retaliation from the platform. Convenience Sampling limited the extent to which we were able to understand differences across demographic subgroups. Future work should explore this issue. Further, recruitment overlooked the perspectives of care coordinators and caregivers who have left the platform due to difficulties This study draws on data gathered from one week of observations performed in July 2022 and 30 interviews conducted between May2022 and August 2022. We conducted in-depth interviews to understand the cultural inputs that shape algorithm design and the implications for caregivers and coordinators. Interviews are well-suited for understanding social dimensions of how people interpret the world and take actions based on those interpretations [64]. Interviews with technology workers show how they make sense of their work and build systems [67], and interviews with caregivers and coordinators show that care practices diverge from organizational philosophy [53]. After several interviews, one researcher visitedStayHome’s global headquarters and a company-owned agency,located in a major Midwestern city in the U.S. The researcher toured the company’s offices and met with support staff. In addition, theresearcher engaged these actors in informal conversations to learn how StayHome and CareTech operate. To understand how the plat-form is presented to caregivers and what aspects of paid care work are emphasized, the researcher observed a caregiver training ses-sion on lifting and transferring techniques at one of StayHome’scompany-owned franchises and attended a virtual onboarding ses-sion with CareTech in the afternoon.We developed the interview guide with interest in valuation and evaluation practices as they occur on CareTech’s platform. Treating valuation as a moral outlook, we drew on practice-oriented approaches to understanding how different actors conceptualize and contribute value in labor contexts [36]. Examining the practices of the people that develop platforms and those who are subject to their architecture provides an opportunity to identify the underlying justifications and actions that shape and transform care work as it occurs on the ground. Interview questions thus sought to elicit interviewees' daily practices, what elements of their work they described as most important, the least favorite aspects of their work,and their ideological orientation towards the concept of ‘care.’After obtaining consent, we recorded the interviews, which lasted between 45 and 90 minutes and took place mainly over Zoom. However, we did interview several caregivers and one coordinator in person. Team members iteratively refined these themes through discussion and mapped them to the EoW framework. We used a third-party qualitative coding tool (NVivo) to complete the coding process. To make theoretical sense of the data, we returned to the literature and iterated between data and extant research. Our findings indicate that technologists drew on several economies of worth—which we refer to as moral frameworks—to navigate the seemingly irreconcilable demands of home care. They referenced multiple interpretations of the term ‘care’ to resolve contradictions.We illustrate this point by first focusing on how technologists described the problems that they claim to solve. Then, we analyze the nature of the solutions they presented, highlighting how technolo-gists imbued different aspects of algorithm design and function with moral meanings. This finding demonstrates the interpretive flexibil-ity of technological artifacts. Finally, we turn to the perspectives of caregivers and coordinators. Their accounts show how algorithmic staffing practices created new forms of uncertainty—the mirror of technologists' stated intentions.4.1 Navigating Contextual ComplexityTechnologists drew on multiple moral frameworks to navigate expectations and demands, appealing to various interpretations of care’ to reconcile the contradictory pressures they face. The technologists we interviewed framed CareTech as a platform developed to address traditional home care agencies’ logistical and opera-tional challenges. In this context, they appealed to an industrial moral framework, framing their work as introducing greater levels of efficiency and rationalization to the home care industry. How-ever, many of the technologists we interviewed also framed their work in terms of a civic moral framework, critiquing prior staffing practices as subjective, opaque, unfair, and harmful to the material well-being of caregivers. Although these two narratives may appear contradictory, technologists unified these demands by appealing to the societal need for more care. For example, improvements inefficiency were discussed in terms of increasing the affordability of care while improving working conditions was imagined as growing the size of the caregiving workforce. We argue that technologists navigate complexity when creating and developing care algorithms by strategically appealing to justifications corresponding to differ-ent moral frameworks, drawing on multiple interpretations of a single term to move between them. Throughout this section, we draw attention to how technologists position algorithmic staffing practices as one solution to the problems they described.4.1.1 Platform Description & Motivations. The rhetoric that tech-nologists and company executives used to describe their motivation for building the platform appealed to domestic and social goods.

Repeated references to the relationship between CareTech and the agencies with which it partners serve two purposes. First, they identify areas whereCareTech uses technology to increase efficiency in the home care industry. This problem formulation provides the background for how organizational solutions are framed. Second, they format a division of labor. In this account, partner agencies are positioned as responsible for managing relationships in local markets, while the platform oversees aspects of labor control and management.Here, technologists frame the platform’s work in industrial terms and partner agencies in domestic terms. 4.1.2 Staffing Practices as Solutions. As they justified their work,technologists also blended elements from multiple moral frame-works. Specifically, they simultaneously appealed to notions of market dominance and civic responsibility. This overlap materialized as Robert, a data scientist, stated that the company’s scale offered a ‘unified view across markets’ and provided access to a sufficient amount of data to use statistical techniques to ‘learn from the data to provide better home care’, serving as a “competitive dif-ferentiator in the market.” In addition, Floyd framed the company's size as affording more ‘careful’ staffing practice:From a systemic perspective, when you are bigger you have these systems in place, and you do not have to guilt somebody into working a shift.

On the other, they describe their work as motivated by a desire to optimize relationships between caregivers and care recipients. At the same time, they framed their efforts as improving fairness, accountability, and transparency in staffing practices. Pair-ing discussions of metrics—which break care down into constituent elements associated with industrial efficiency—with algorithms staffing practices—which technologists use to frame evaluation in domestic terms—reveals that these actors associate different parts of their job with distinct moral frameworks to meet a complex set of demands. Further, interviews with caregivers and coordinators reveal that these performance evaluation criteria and platform staffing practices are a source of tension and stress.4.3 Platform AsymmetriesWhat are the consequences of technologists’ actions? To answer this question, we turn to platform caregivers’ and care coordinators’ per-spectives and experiences. Contrary to technologists’ aspirations touse algorithms to build a fairer, more transparent order, algorithmic staffing practices in fact created new conditions of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. First, we focus on evaluation practices.CareTech’s app for caregivers displays ratings across several met-rics related to operational aspects of care delivery (i.e., timeliness,consistency, application usage, and call-offs). The platform also sends weekly caregiver evaluation surveys to coordinators but does not share this feedback directly with caregivers. Further, caregivers rarely received qualitative feedback regarding the quality of care they provided. Caregivers discussed how these aspects of platform design contributed to ambiguity regarding insight into their perfor-mance, while coordinators approached completing survey-based caregiver evaluations with ambivalence. Second, we analyze care-givers’ interactions with CareTech’s staffing practices. Caregivers described experiencing collapsed boundaries between working and personal time. Despite these new challenges, the caregivers and coordinators we interviewed did not mention a desire to leave. .4.3.1 Ambiguity and Ambivalence. While caregivers described providing care as meaningful and were generally content with the conditions they faced on the platform, they discussed a lack of clarity regarding expectations and performance. As Hayden said:I believe that the clients, they also rate us after every shift. So then if we get rated lowly every time or pretty consistently, I’m sure they will reach out tous...I don’t know that it helps us rate our care and how well we’re doing with our clients, but I don't know how else they could do that...you hear stories of people who are dissatisfied with their care, and that's hard to tell.It was only after connecting with other caregivers that Hayden Learned that it was possible to request a performance evaluation form CareTech. Further, the opacity of metrics created feelings of worry for care-givers about their performance. As a new caregiver on the platform,Hazel worried about a low client consistency rating and discussed needing to take the initiative to understand why she received low ratings across other metrics. Puzzled about low application usage ratings, Hazel described needing to reach out to CareTech to understand “what [she] was missing.” CareTech’s communication and evaluation practices created unclear situations with multiple interpretations and required additional labor on the part of caregivers to understand how care recipients experienced their care and how the platform judged their performance. Coordinators, on the other hand, discussed their own evaluation practices as infused with ambivalence—a finding that we found surprising given the intimate and impactful context of care for an older loved one. While coordinators described clear feelings about the care provided to loved ones, our interviewees responded to CareTech’s evaluation surveys inconsistently. Coordinators expressed satisfaction with the care that caregivers provided and thus did not feel a need to fill out the company’s weekly care-giver evaluation survey, described how these surveys were not as useful compared to in-person evaluations performed over more extended periods, or expressed that they did not feel their feedback through these outlets was listened to by CareTech. Phyllis—who lives with her care recipient—described that since the quality of care was so consistent, there was not a need to be very detailed in her evaluations: “they will send out those [surveys] weekly...soyou click on attentiveness, preparation, and I don’t remember what they all are. There’s about five of them. I don’t get very detailed.” On The other hand, Brooks—who did not live with his care recipient,and was dissatisfied with the consistency of staffing provided byCareTech—described feeling overwhelmed by the amount of eval-uating he was asked to do: “For each one of the caregivers that has been in, they’re asking for an opinion for eight to 10 caregivers everyMonday, on the same thing, the same people doing the same thing.I’ve had a hard time seeing the value on a weekly basis.” He saw more value in evaluations carried out over longer intervals as it had been before the acquisition. There used to be the quarterly report where they would actually go in and visit and come back and say,‘this has changed, or this looks like it’s changed’...when someone steps in four or five times a year those are the ones that can pick out some things.Opal, who uses CareTech to provide care to her husband, discussed her attitude towards the surveys: “Honestly, I ignore [the surveys]. It’s not something I want to do. I don’t know why. I know they're doing great.” These perspectives demonstrate a difference in the worth actors ascribed to particular evaluation practices, high-lighting a mismatch between technologists’, coordinators’, and care-givers’ perspectives. Other coordinators described non-use of CareTech’s evaluation infrastructure, even when there were striking departures from care expectations. Coordinators justified their approach by appealing to different moral frameworks. Riley said, “what did happen onetime, and I should probably be more tuned into it...there was one day when one of the caregivers didn’t show up at all. And I didn't know about it until the next day.” She justified the non-use through appeals to a domestic moral framework: “I’m not as hands-on, I’mnot looking at the app to see what they’re doing. I get my feedback on how they’re doing from my mom and dad.” Winnie, who relied on a caregiver to transport her mother to church on Sunday mornings, described situations where sometimes a caregiver assigned to the shift couldn’t drive or had no car. Even so, she did not fill out regular surveys, drawing on her experience as a business owner (industrial)to express that she understood the challenges of staffing shifts: “it’sa very hard thing to maneuver in the world that we’re walking in. We Own a small business. We employ 13 ladies, so I understand.” At the same time, she seemed to negatively moralize non-use: “I will be honest with you that a survey has come...I haven’t filled it out. So I Haven't done due diligence on my part. You know, so I’m going to own that part.” While some coordinators expressed frustration about consistency, communication, quality, and the efficacy of evaluation practices, they appealed to multiple moral frameworks to justify different uses of evaluation infrastructure.4.3.2 Work Practices and Professional Boundaries. Continued dis-cussion with caregivers provided insight into how the problems that technologists faced contributed to aspects of platform design.The need to fill open shifts and coordinate care work across multiple individuals—associated with an industrial moral framework—took precedence over other concerns. Francine’s account of interactions with CareTech provides an example of how the need to staff shifts devalued communication about performance: “they have never given me any feedback or evaluation, the only time they call is about the schedule, asking if you can work more.” We argue that technologists prioritization of needs associated with the industrial moral frame-work eroded the boundary between caregivers’ work and personal lives and changed care practices.For example, the platform uses a notification system to bring open shifts to caregivers’ attention. However, Pepper describe how the constant notification stream makes it difficult for her to differentiate between work and leisure time:I can tell they have a lot of shifts to fill in. Am I go-ing to be under pressure? They’ve asked me for five things, and you said no to all of them, it feels likeI should say yes to something now. It’s just a little harder to be either working or not working...when you see your phone in the morning and you see all those notifications there.Hayden described receiving “30 to 40” notifications a day from the app, even after reaching out to CareTech to express that they would not work any more shifts. Further, they described confu-sion and frustration regarding the processes by which shifts were initially assigned:I actually said no to [the shift], but they scheduled me anyway. Which was how I got a lot of my shifts,which was okay...I know sometimes it sounds weird,but I would say no to a shift, maybe they’d think thatI said yes.This account suggests that the platform does not allow for as much flexibility as technologists imagine.In contrast to legacy record-keeping procedures, where care-givers left paper-based care notes in clients’ homes, CareTech’splatform requires that caregivers describe their shifts upon clock-ing out in an electronic journal that is viewable by coordinators and other caregivers. While caregivers described that the journal helped them feel more prepared for each shift, they also described reading journal entries outside of working hours, which provided further evidence for blurred boundaries between work and personal life.For example, Chauncey described reading entries “at night, before Igo to bed, I start reading if I’m going to work the next morning.” In Addition, platform architecture requiring caregivers to complete these logs changed caregivers’ relationship to time spent on the job. Francine described how filling out the notes, especially in the time-sensitive context of a shift, placed pressure on how she spent time providing care: “if you clock out right at a minute after [your shift ends] they get you on that.” Efforts to avoid disciplinary action created new relationships to time: “I just always try to clock out a few minutes before because you get all these questions before closing out the app” (Francine). In these cases, platform architecture changed caregivers' relationships with their time both on and off the clock,which put caregivers under additional pressure.We found that aspects of platform and algorithm design create new forms of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. We argue that this results from a mismatch between technologists’ moral reasoning and that of other platform actors. In addition, the need to fill open shifts and coordinate work across many individuals pri-oritizes a logic of efficiency over concerns for caregiver job quality.Despite coordinators’ unmet expectations and new pressures that the platform placed on caregivers, both sets of actors maintain a commitment to the platform. A possible explanation for contin-ued attachment is the moral significance of ‘care.’ While the term carries various meanings across actors and situations, it may act as a resource that maintains a particular status quo by mitigating organized critique of or departure from the platform.

12,Coordinators,Agent,"The subject of our case study, CareTech4, is one of several start-upsthat are credited with “reinventing the [home care] agency model”[22]. Prior to data collection, CareTech acquired StayHome, a traditional home care agency franchise. To contextualize our findings,we briefly discuss CareTech’s business model.CareTech partners with traditional home care agencies to support back-end administrative, legal, compliance, and logistics functions in exchange for a share of partner agencies’ revenue, employing caregivers directly. Caregivers assist with activities of daily living(i.e., bathing, dressing, getting in or out of a bed or chair, walking,using the toilet, eating) [43], and instrumental activities of daily living (i.e., cooking, cleaning, transportation, laundry, managing finances) [46]. CareTech’s use of algorithms to match caregivers to care recipients is central to our case. When we started data collection, CareTech’s technology platform had recently been im-plemented at StayHome’s company-owned agencies, providing a unique opportunity to investigate care algorithm implementation.In this paper, we focus primarily on CareTech’s staffing prac-tices. CareTech uses metrics and algorithms, along with human management, to staff shifts. Staffing algorithms have a role at two main sites: as initial schedules were made and when other care-givers called off their shifts. When caregivers are scheduled during their onboarding, staff members at CareTech use algorithmic recommendation systems to match caregivers with care recipients. Evaluation metrics (i.e., timeliness, consistency, application usage,and call-offs), along with other data (e.g., caregiver commute time,number of complaints) are used to match caregivers and care recipients. Coordinators receive weekly surveys about the quality of care provided, and provide responses on a linear scale5. After IRB approval, we recruited participants—technologists (n =14), caregivers (n = 9), and coordinators (n = 7)—through a partnership with CareTech and StayHome for interviews using convenience and purposive sampling [10]. StayHome’s research staff arranged site visit and helped recruit participants. We provided a brief description of the study and a screening questionnaire distributed amongst the caregivers and coordinators over email. This approach provided an opportunity to learn from technologists, caregivers,coordinators who were enthusiastic about sharing their experi-ences with the platform. Table 2 and table 3 provide an overview of participant profiles.(1) Technologists: Technologists consisted of software engi-neers, designers, product managers, and data and opera-tions workers. Software engineers talked about buildingCareTech’s features and the company’s history. Designers Develop CareTech’s front-end user experience for caregivers.Designers, the operations team, and a product manager described how they approached curating the caregiver experi-ence. The data scientists, data analysts, and data stewards dis-cussed the metrics used to measure caregiver performance,the data that staffing algorithms use, and how algorithms work in practice.(2) Caregivers: We use the term ‘caregivers’ to refer to the people employed by CareTech to provide care for pay.(3) Coordinators: The term ‘coordinators’ refers to people that pay for CareTech’s services and coordinate their delivery,usually on behalf of an older loved one. Recruiting interview participants through a partnership with Stay-Home and CareTech potentially biased results toward more positive perspectives of organizational practices. Caregivers and coordina-tors with more negative views about the company may have been reluctant to share their opinions or participate in interviews alto-gether due to fears of retaliation from the platform. Convenience Sampling limited the extent to which we were able to understand differences across demographic subgroups. Future work should explore this issue. Further, recruitment overlooked the perspectives of care coordinators and caregivers who have left the platform due to difficulties This study draws on data gathered from one week of observations performed in July 2022 and 30 interviews conducted between May2022 and August 2022. We conducted in-depth interviews to understand the cultural inputs that shape algorithm design and the implications for caregivers and coordinators. Interviews are well-suited for understanding social dimensions of how people interpret the world and take actions based on those interpretations [64]. Interviews with technology workers show how they make sense of their work and build systems [67], and interviews with caregivers and coordinators show that care practices diverge from organizational philosophy [53]. After several interviews, one researcher visitedStayHome’s global headquarters and a company-owned agency,located in a major Midwestern city in the U.S. The researcher toured the company’s offices and met with support staff. In addition, theresearcher engaged these actors in informal conversations to learn how StayHome and CareTech operate. To understand how the plat-form is presented to caregivers and what aspects of paid care work are emphasized, the researcher observed a caregiver training ses-sion on lifting and transferring techniques at one of StayHome’scompany-owned franchises and attended a virtual onboarding ses-sion with CareTech in the afternoon.We developed the interview guide with interest in valuation and evaluation practices as they occur on CareTech’s platform. Treating valuation as a moral outlook, we drew on practice-oriented approaches to understanding how different actors conceptualize and contribute value in labor contexts [36]. Examining the practices of the people that develop platforms and those who are subject to their architecture provides an opportunity to identify the underlying justifications and actions that shape and transform care work as it occurs on the ground. Interview questions thus sought to elicit interviewees' daily practices, what elements of their work they described as most important, the least favorite aspects of their work,and their ideological orientation towards the concept of ‘care.’After obtaining consent, we recorded the interviews, which lasted between 45 and 90 minutes and took place mainly over Zoom. However, we did interview several caregivers and one coordinator in person. Team members iteratively refined these themes through discussion and mapped them to the EoW framework. We used a third-party qualitative coding tool (NVivo) to complete the coding process. To make theoretical sense of the data, we returned to the literature and iterated between data and extant research. Our findings indicate that technologists drew on several economies of worth—which we refer to as moral frameworks—to navigate the seemingly irreconcilable demands of home care. They referenced multiple interpretations of the term ‘care’ to resolve contradictions.We illustrate this point by first focusing on how technologists described the problems that they claim to solve. Then, we analyze the nature of the solutions they presented, highlighting how technolo-gists imbued different aspects of algorithm design and function with moral meanings. This finding demonstrates the interpretive flexibil-ity of technological artifacts. Finally, we turn to the perspectives of caregivers and coordinators. Their accounts show how algorithmic staffing practices created new forms of uncertainty—the mirror of technologists' stated intentions.4.1 Navigating Contextual ComplexityTechnologists drew on multiple moral frameworks to navigate expectations and demands, appealing to various interpretations of care’ to reconcile the contradictory pressures they face. The technologists we interviewed framed CareTech as a platform developed to address traditional home care agencies’ logistical and opera-tional challenges. In this context, they appealed to an industrial moral framework, framing their work as introducing greater levels of efficiency and rationalization to the home care industry. How-ever, many of the technologists we interviewed also framed their work in terms of a civic moral framework, critiquing prior staffing practices as subjective, opaque, unfair, and harmful to the material well-being of caregivers. Although these two narratives may appear contradictory, technologists unified these demands by appealing to the societal need for more care. For example, improvements inefficiency were discussed in terms of increasing the affordability of care while improving working conditions was imagined as growing the size of the caregiving workforce. We argue that technologists navigate complexity when creating and developing care algorithms by strategically appealing to justifications corresponding to differ-ent moral frameworks, drawing on multiple interpretations of a single term to move between them. Throughout this section, we draw attention to how technologists position algorithmic staffing practices as one solution to the problems they described.4.1.1 Platform Description & Motivations. The rhetoric that tech-nologists and company executives used to describe their motivation for building the platform appealed to domestic and social goods. In press releases and on the company website, CareTech’s execu-tives described their frustrations in searching for care for their own parents. Similarly, technologists invoked ideas of familial respon-sibility, relaying stories about their difficulties in finding care for aging parents. Technologists also drew on more civic-oriented no-tions of good, framing their work with reference to positive social change. For example, Richard described, “being part of something that can have a positive impact on society.” The company’s mission statement, was described as ‘improving care in society6, highlight-ing the significance of a single moral concept in technologists discourse.In discussing the company’s strategy, the technologists we in-terviewed described CareTech as a “platform,” “communication company,” or “logistical engine,”, foregrounding CareTech’s use of digital technology to improve efficiency, and framed their work asa response to logistical challenges in the home care industry. Aiden described what he framed as the company’s main value proposition:I think the big sort of sell is, it is getting harder and harder to operate care. I think it is getting more expensive...the core value proposition is where we are trying to figure out how to build a platform around doing this, and helping agencies focus more on their relationships with their communities and customers.He elaborated that, by centralizing operations, CareTech offers partner agencies relief from work that is “consuming and grueling,whether it’s paperwork, management, documentation, staffing, lo-gistics, or being on call all the time.” By filling this role, CareTech‘frees up agencies to both source customers and maintain that rela-tionship and kind of connection’ (Aiden). Repeated references to the relationship between CareTech and the agencies with which it partners serve two purposes. First, they identify areas whereCareTech uses technology to increase efficiency in the home care industry. This problem formulation provides the background for how organizational solutions are framed. Second, they format a division of labor. In this account, partner agencies are positioned as responsible for managing relationships in local markets, while the platform oversees aspects of labor control and management.Here, technologists frame the platform’s work in industrial terms and partner agencies in domestic terms. 4.1.2 Staffing Practices as Solutions. As they justified their work,technologists also blended elements from multiple moral frame-works. Specifically, they simultaneously appealed to notions of market dominance and civic responsibility. This overlap materialized as Robert, a data scientist, stated that the company’s scale offered a ‘unified view across markets’ and provided access to a sufficient amount of data to use statistical techniques to ‘learn from the data to provide better home care’, serving as a “competitive dif-ferentiator in the market.” In addition, Floyd framed the company's size as affording more ‘careful’ staffing practice:From a systemic perspective, when you are bigger you have these systems in place, and you do not have to guilt somebody into working a shift. If you need a shift filled, you have a stable of hundreds of caregivers you can reach out to, it is just a matter of how much bonus you have to put on it.These rhetorical strategies demonstrate how technologists draw on multiple moral frameworks to present their work as solutions to different problems.Building on discussions of CareTech’s organizational strategy,technologists most concretely articulated their efforts toward ‘im-proving care in society’ through labor management. They started these discussions by problematizing caregiver job quality under legacy home care practices as associated with low wages, few ben-efits, rigid scheduling practices, and little recognition of caregivers efforts. Kennedy critiqued legacy staffing practices on the grounds of fairness and transparency:There’s a lot of favoritism that happens. There’s a lack of transparency. And so as you can imagine, the caregivers who work the most shifts, they’re able to earn the most amount of money. And that’s really helping to improve their lives and livelihoods. Other technologists framed algorithmic staffing as a solution to the legacy staffing practices that Kennedy identified as opaque and unfair. While Kennedy incorporated concerns about material well-being into her critiques, other technologists generally avoided discussing their efforts toward increasing caregiver job quality in terms of a market-based moral framework. This may have resulted from the market constraints of care, where the price for private pay home care is inaccessible for many families. Aria explainedthat raising wages for caregivers would make the price of care“unpayable” by many clients. 4.1.3 Professionalizing Care. Instead, technologists framed their efforts as attempts to improve caregivers’ status and provide them with a career. Aria noted that improving the collective status of caregivers was part of CareTech’s mission since its founding, em-phasizing challenging aspects of the job:I think that a really big piece of what CareTech is try-ing to do and has been trying to do since the beginning you know, elevate the profession of caregiving. Andtruly treat it a profession instead of just a job...because it's a difficult, emotionally intense, sometimes physi-cally intense thing to do.Floyd described further aspirations to elevate caregivers’ status through professionalization:I would say that [career] is a north star for us. I think everyone views that as an innovation that we can and should make, and the profession is worth it... we're working towards it, but we haven’t actually gotten there yet.These discussions highlight the links that technologists establish between different moral frameworks as they respond to a complex set of challenges. While they expressed concern about the value that care holds in society, increasing the pecuniary value of car was viewed as infeasible. Technologists responded to this problem by appealing to the status of the profession. However, technologists most defined solutions came in the form of staffing algorithms.4.2 Datafying CareWe unpack staffing practices at CareTech, which we argue are emblematic of technological solutionism. Our analysis reveals that technologists associated different aspects of staffing algorithms with different moral frameworks. We argue that how decisions are made about who is best suited for particular shifts—and why—is changing with the advent and implementation of algorithmic staffing tools as technologists prioritize efficiency. However, discussions with technologists show that there are tensions present in the use of algorithms. On the one hand, technologists discussed their work in terms of trying to increase caregiver performance. Performance Evaluation metrics break care into a set of constituent elements closely aligned with operational efficiency (an appeal to the indus-trial moral framework). On the other hand, technologists described their work as oriented toward establishing long-term relationships between caregivers and care recipients (an appeal to the domestic moral framework).The metrics and measurements that support algorithmic staffing practices are most closely associated with notions of productivity and operational efficiency. Technologists presented one part of their work as oriented toward increasing the “performance, or perceived performance of the caregiver” (Floyd). They described how this work is accomplished by measuring: (1) timeliness (how frequently a caregiver arrives to a shift on time); (2) consistency (adherence to schedule shifts); (3) application usage (whether or not the caregiver uses the application to clock in to and out of shifts and evaluate care recipient well-being); and (4) call-offs (shifts not released seven days in advance). While this evaluation practice makes care legible based on a discrete set of metrics, the composition of these metrics is oriented toward operational efficiency rather than the experiences of care recipients or care coordinators.Technologists contrasted their work with platforms in the ride-hailing industry7, describing how their work was motivated by the desire to establish long-term relationships between caregivers and care recipients. They referenced algorithms in terms that framed care as a holistic practice, often comparing the product of their work to other intimate relationships. Staffing algorithms have a role at two main sites: as initial schedules were made and when other caregivers called off their shifts. When caregivers are scheduled during their onboarding, staff members at CareTech use algorithmic recommendation systems to match caregivers with care recipients.In both cases, platform architects compared the matching process to other intimate relations between caregivers and care recipients.In Sandra’s words: Once the data are all collected, [the algorithm] gives us a list of caregivers, and it was ranked by most likely to be picked up by the caregiver...there is a...I don't want to say negotiating, but there are conversations that go back and forth. Because it does become an arranged marriage when you’re putting it inside thehome.In instances where shifts opened up with clients, the platform gives caregivers the option to pick up shifts with these clients through a user interface that Floyd described as “not not tinder 8 inspired. In advancing these relationship-based arguments, technologists define quality care by referencing domestic relationships between caregivers and care recipients.On the one hand, technologists seek to build a platform that effi-ciently delivers consistent care to a growing number of older adult care recipients. On the other, they describe their work as motivated by a desire to optimize relationships between caregivers and care recipients. At the same time, they framed their efforts as improving fairness, accountability, and transparency in staffing practices. Pair-ing discussions of metrics—which break care down into constituent elements associated with industrial efficiency—with algorithms staffing practices—which technologists use to frame evaluation in domestic terms—reveals that these actors associate different parts of their job with distinct moral frameworks to meet a complex set of demands. Further, interviews with caregivers and coordinators reveal that these performance evaluation criteria and platform staffing practices are a source of tension and stress.4.3 Platform AsymmetriesWhat are the consequences of technologists’ actions? To answer this question, we turn to platform caregivers’ and care coordinators’ per-spectives and experiences. Contrary to technologists’ aspirations touse algorithms to build a fairer, more transparent order, algorithmic staffing practices in fact created new conditions of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. First, we focus on evaluation practices.CareTech’s app for caregivers displays ratings across several met-rics related to operational aspects of care delivery (i.e., timeliness,consistency, application usage, and call-offs). The platform also sends weekly caregiver evaluation surveys to coordinators but does not share this feedback directly with caregivers. Further, caregivers rarely received qualitative feedback regarding the quality of care they provided. Caregivers discussed how these aspects of platform design contributed to ambiguity regarding insight into their perfor-mance, while coordinators approached completing survey-based caregiver evaluations with ambivalence. Second, we analyze care-givers’ interactions with CareTech’s staffing practices. Caregivers described experiencing collapsed boundaries between working and personal time.

So I Haven't done due diligence on my part. You know, so I’m going to own that part.” While some coordinators expressed frustration about consistency, communication, quality, and the efficacy of evaluation practices, they appealed to multiple moral frameworks to justify different uses of evaluation infrastructure.4.3.2 Work Practices and Professional Boundaries.

Further, they described confu-sion and frustration regarding the processes by which shifts were initially assigned:I actually said no to [the shift], but they scheduled me anyway. Which was how I got a lot of my shifts,which was okay...I know sometimes it sounds weird,but I would say no to a shift, maybe they’d think thatI said yes.This account suggests that the platform does not allow for as much flexibility as technologists imagine.In contrast to legacy record-keeping procedures, where care-givers left paper-based care notes in clients’ homes, CareTech’splatform requires that caregivers describe their shifts upon clock-ing out in an electronic journal that is viewable by coordinators and other caregivers. While caregivers described that the journal helped them feel more prepared for each shift, they also described reading journal entries outside of working hours, which provided further evidence for blurred boundaries between work and personal life.For example, Chauncey described reading entries “at night, before Igo to bed, I start reading if I’m going to work the next morning.” In Addition, platform architecture requiring caregivers to complete these logs changed caregivers’ relationship to time spent on the job. Francine described how filling out the notes, especially in the time-sensitive context of a shift, placed pressure on how she spent time providing care: “if you clock out right at a minute after [your shift ends] they get you on that.” Efforts to avoid disciplinary action created new relationships to time: “I just always try to clock out a few minutes before because you get all these questions before closing out the app” (Francine). In these cases, platform architecture changed caregivers' relationships with their time both on and off the clock,which put caregivers under additional pressure.We found that aspects of platform and algorithm design create new forms of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators.

Prior to data collection, CareTech acquired StayHome, a traditional home care agency franchise. To contextualize our findings,we briefly discuss CareTech’s business model.CareTech partners with traditional home care agencies to support back-end administrative, legal, compliance, and logistics functions in exchange for a share of partner agencies’ revenue, employing caregivers directly. Caregivers assist with activities of daily living(i.e., bathing, dressing, getting in or out of a bed or chair, walking,using the toilet, eating) [43], and instrumental activities of daily living (i.e., cooking, cleaning, transportation, laundry, managing finances) [46]. CareTech’s use of algorithms to match caregivers to care recipients is central to our case. When we started data collection, CareTech’s technology platform had recently been im-plemented at StayHome’s company-owned agencies, providing a unique opportunity to investigate care algorithm implementation.In this paper, we focus primarily on CareTech’s staffing prac-tices. CareTech uses metrics and algorithms, along with human management, to staff shifts. Staffing algorithms have a role at two main sites: as initial schedules were made and when other care-givers called off their shifts. When caregivers are scheduled during their onboarding, staff members at CareTech use algorithmic recommendation systems to match caregivers with care recipients. Evaluation metrics (i.e., timeliness, consistency, application usage,and call-offs), along with other data (e.g., caregiver commute time,number of complaints) are used to match caregivers and care recipients. Coordinators receive weekly surveys about the quality of care provided, and provide responses on a linear scale5. After IRB approval, we recruited participants—technologists (n =14), caregivers (n = 9), and coordinators (n = 7)—through a partnership with CareTech and StayHome for interviews using convenience and purposive sampling [10]. StayHome’s research staff arranged site visit and helped recruit participants. We provided a brief description of the study and a screening questionnaire distributed amongst the caregivers and coordinators over email. This approach provided an opportunity to learn from technologists, caregivers,coordinators who were enthusiastic about sharing their experi-ences with the platform.

Recruiting interview participants through a partnership with Stay-Home and CareTech potentially biased results toward more positive perspectives of organizational practices.

Convenience Sampling limited the extent to which we were able to understand differences across demographic subgroups. Future work should explore this issue. Further, recruitment overlooked the perspectives of care coordinators and caregivers who have left the platform due to difficulties This study draws on data gathered from one week of observations performed in July 2022 and 30 interviews conducted between May2022 and August 2022. We conducted in-depth interviews to understand the cultural inputs that shape algorithm design and the implications for caregivers and coordinators. Interviews are well-suited for understanding social dimensions of how people interpret the world and take actions based on those interpretations [64]. Interviews with technology workers show how they make sense of their work and build systems [67], and interviews with caregivers and coordinators show that care practices diverge from organizational philosophy [53]. After several interviews, one researcher visitedStayHome’s global headquarters and a company-owned agency,located in a major Midwestern city in the U.S. The researcher toured the company’s offices and met with support staff. In addition, theresearcher engaged these actors in informal conversations to learn how StayHome and CareTech operate. To understand how the plat-form is presented to caregivers and what aspects of paid care work are emphasized, the researcher observed a caregiver training ses-sion on lifting and transferring techniques at one of StayHome’scompany-owned franchises and attended a virtual onboarding ses-sion with CareTech in the afternoon.We developed the interview guide with interest in valuation and evaluation practices as they occur on CareTech’s platform. Treating valuation as a moral outlook, we drew on practice-oriented approaches to understanding how different actors conceptualize and contribute value in labor contexts [36]. Examining the practices of the people that develop platforms and those who are subject to their architecture provides an opportunity to identify the underlying justifications and actions that shape and transform care work as it occurs on the ground. Interview questions thus sought to elicit interviewees' daily practices, what elements of their work they described as most important, the least favorite aspects of their work,and their ideological orientation towards the concept of ‘care.’After obtaining consent, we recorded the interviews, which lasted between 45 and 90 minutes and took place mainly over Zoom. However, we did interview several caregivers and one coordinator in person. Team members iteratively refined these themes through discussion and mapped them to the EoW framework. We used a third-party qualitative coding tool (NVivo) to complete the coding process. To make theoretical sense of the data, we returned to the literature and iterated between data and extant research. Our findings indicate that technologists drew on several economies of worth—which we refer to as moral frameworks—to navigate the seemingly irreconcilable demands of home care. They referenced multiple interpretations of the term ‘care’ to resolve contradictions.We illustrate this point by first focusing on how technologists described the problems that they claim to solve. Then, we analyze the nature of the solutions they presented, highlighting how technolo-gists imbued different aspects of algorithm design and function with moral meanings. This finding demonstrates the interpretive flexibil-ity of technological artifacts. Finally, we turn to the perspectives of caregivers and coordinators. Their accounts show how algorithmic staffing practices created new forms of uncertainty—the mirror of technologists' stated intentions.4.1 Navigating Contextual ComplexityTechnologists drew on multiple moral frameworks to navigate expectations and demands, appealing to various interpretations of care’ to reconcile the contradictory pressures they face. The technologists we interviewed framed CareTech as a platform developed to address traditional home care agencies’ logistical and opera-tional challenges. In this context, they appealed to an industrial moral framework, framing their work as introducing greater levels of efficiency and rationalization to the home care industry. How-ever, many of the technologists we interviewed also framed their work in terms of a civic moral framework, critiquing prior staffing practices as subjective, opaque, unfair, and harmful to the material well-being of caregivers. Although these two narratives may appear contradictory, technologists unified these demands by appealing to the societal need for more care. For example, improvements inefficiency were discussed in terms of increasing the affordability of care while improving working conditions was imagined as growing the size of the caregiving workforce. We argue that technologists navigate complexity when creating and developing care algorithms by strategically appealing to justifications corresponding to differ-ent moral frameworks, drawing on multiple interpretations of a single term to move between them. Throughout this section, we draw attention to how technologists position algorithmic staffing practices as one solution to the problems they described.4.1.1 Platform Description & Motivations. The rhetoric that tech-nologists and company executives used to describe their motivation for building the platform appealed to domestic and social goods. In press releases and on the company website, CareTech’s execu-tives described their frustrations in searching for care for their own parents. Similarly, technologists invoked ideas of familial respon-sibility, relaying stories about their difficulties in finding care for aging parents. Technologists also drew on more civic-oriented no-tions of good, framing their work with reference to positive social change. For example, Richard described, “being part of something that can have a positive impact on society.” The company’s mission statement, was described as ‘improving care in society6, highlight-ing the significance of a single moral concept in technologists discourse.In discussing the company’s strategy, the technologists we in-terviewed described CareTech as a “platform,” “communication company,” or “logistical engine,”, foregrounding CareTech’s use of digital technology to improve efficiency, and framed their work asa response to logistical challenges in the home care industry. Aiden described what he framed as the company’s main value proposition:I think the big sort of sell is, it is getting harder and harder to operate care. I think it is getting more expensive...the core value proposition is where we are trying to figure out how to build a platform around doing this, and helping agencies focus more on their relationships with their communities and customers.He elaborated that, by centralizing operations, CareTech offers partner agencies relief from work that is “consuming and grueling,whether it’s paperwork, management, documentation, staffing, lo-gistics, or being on call all the time.” By filling this role, CareTech‘frees up agencies to both source customers and maintain that rela-tionship and kind of connection’ (Aiden). Repeated references to the relationship between CareTech and the agencies with which it partners serve two purposes. First, they identify areas whereCareTech uses technology to increase efficiency in the home care industry. This problem formulation provides the background for how organizational solutions are framed. Second, they format a division of labor. In this account, partner agencies are positioned as responsible for managing relationships in local markets, while the platform oversees aspects of labor control and management.Here, technologists frame the platform’s work in industrial terms and partner agencies in domestic terms. 4.1.2 Staffing Practices as Solutions. As they justified their work,technologists also blended elements from multiple moral frame-works. Specifically, they simultaneously appealed to notions of market dominance and civic responsibility. This overlap materialized as Robert, a data scientist, stated that the company’s scale offered a ‘unified view across markets’ and provided access to a sufficient amount of data to use statistical techniques to ‘learn from the data to provide better home care’, serving as a “competitive dif-ferentiator in the market.” In addition, Floyd framed the company's size as affording more ‘careful’ staffing practice:From a systemic perspective, when you are bigger you have these systems in place, and you do not have to guilt somebody into working a shift. If you need a shift filled, you have a stable of hundreds of caregivers you can reach out to, it is just a matter of how much bonus you have to put on it.These rhetorical strategies demonstrate how technologists draw on multiple moral frameworks to present their work as solutions to different problems.Building on discussions of CareTech’s organizational strategy,technologists most concretely articulated their efforts toward ‘im-proving care in society’ through labor management. They started these discussions by problematizing caregiver job quality under legacy home care practices as associated with low wages, few ben-efits, rigid scheduling practices, and little recognition of caregivers efforts. Kennedy critiqued legacy staffing practices on the grounds of fairness and transparency:There’s a lot of favoritism that happens. There’s a lack of transparency. And so as you can imagine, the caregivers who work the most shifts, they’re able to earn the most amount of money. And that’s really helping to improve their lives and livelihoods. Other technologists framed algorithmic staffing as a solution to the legacy staffing practices that Kennedy identified as opaque and unfair. While Kennedy incorporated concerns about material well-being into her critiques, other technologists generally avoided discussing their efforts toward increasing caregiver job quality in terms of a market-based moral framework. This may have resulted from the market constraints of care, where the price for private pay home care is inaccessible for many families. Aria explainedthat raising wages for caregivers would make the price of care“unpayable” by many clients. 4.1.3 Professionalizing Care. Instead, technologists framed their efforts as attempts to improve caregivers’ status and provide them with a career. Aria noted that improving the collective status of caregivers was part of CareTech’s mission since its founding, em-phasizing challenging aspects of the job:I think that a really big piece of what CareTech is try-ing to do and has been trying to do since the beginning you know, elevate the profession of caregiving. Andtruly treat it a profession instead of just a job...because it's a difficult, emotionally intense, sometimes physi-cally intense thing to do.Floyd described further aspirations to elevate caregivers’ status through professionalization:I would say that [career] is a north star for us. I think everyone views that as an innovation that we can and should make, and the profession is worth it... we're working towards it, but we haven’t actually gotten there yet.These discussions highlight the links that technologists establish between different moral frameworks as they respond to a complex set of challenges. While they expressed concern about the value that care holds in society, increasing the pecuniary value of car was viewed as infeasible. Technologists responded to this problem by appealing to the status of the profession. However, technologists most defined solutions came in the form of staffing algorithms.4.2 Datafying CareWe unpack staffing practices at CareTech, which we argue are emblematic of technological solutionism. Our analysis reveals that technologists associated different aspects of staffing algorithms with different moral frameworks. We argue that how decisions are made about who is best suited for particular shifts—and why—is changing with the advent and implementation of algorithmic staffing tools as technologists prioritize efficiency. However, discussions with technologists show that there are tensions present in the use of algorithms. On the one hand, technologists discussed their work in terms of trying to increase caregiver performance. Performance Evaluation metrics break care into a set of constituent elements closely aligned with operational efficiency (an appeal to the indus-trial moral framework). On the other hand, technologists described their work as oriented toward establishing long-term relationships between caregivers and care recipients (an appeal to the domestic moral framework).The metrics and measurements that support algorithmic staffing practices are most closely associated with notions of productivity and operational efficiency. Technologists presented one part of their work as oriented toward increasing the “performance, or perceived performance of the caregiver” (Floyd). They described how this work is accomplished by measuring: (1) timeliness (how frequently a caregiver arrives to a shift on time); (2) consistency (adherence to schedule shifts); (3) application usage (whether or not the caregiver uses the application to clock in to and out of shifts and evaluate care recipient well-being); and (4) call-offs (shifts not released seven days in advance). While this evaluation practice makes care legible based on a discrete set of metrics, the composition of these metrics is oriented toward operational efficiency rather than the experiences of care recipients or care coordinators.Technologists contrasted their work with platforms in the ride-hailing industry7, describing how their work was motivated by the desire to establish long-term relationships between caregivers and care recipients. They referenced algorithms in terms that framed care as a holistic practice, often comparing the product of their work to other intimate relationships. Staffing algorithms have a role at two main sites: as initial schedules were made and when other caregivers called off their shifts. When caregivers are scheduled during their onboarding, staff members at CareTech use algorithmic recommendation systems to match caregivers with care recipients.In both cases, platform architects compared the matching process to other intimate relations between caregivers and care recipients.In Sandra’s words: Once the data are all collected, [the algorithm] gives us a list of caregivers, and it was ranked by most likely to be picked up by the caregiver...there is a...I don't want to say negotiating, but there are conversations that go back and forth. Because it does become an arranged marriage when you’re putting it inside thehome.In instances where shifts opened up with clients, the platform gives caregivers the option to pick up shifts with these clients through a user interface that Floyd described as “not not tinder 8 inspired. In advancing these relationship-based arguments, technologists define quality care by referencing domestic relationships between caregivers and care recipients.On the one hand, technologists seek to build a platform that effi-ciently delivers consistent care to a growing number of older adult care recipients. On the other, they describe their work as motivated by a desire to optimize relationships between caregivers and care recipients. At the same time, they framed their efforts as improving fairness, accountability, and transparency in staffing practices. Pair-ing discussions of metrics—which break care down into constituent elements associated with industrial efficiency—with algorithms staffing practices—which technologists use to frame evaluation in domestic terms—reveals that these actors associate different parts of their job with distinct moral frameworks to meet a complex set of demands. Further, interviews with caregivers and coordinators reveal that these performance evaluation criteria and platform staffing practices are a source of tension and stress.4.3 Platform AsymmetriesWhat are the consequences of technologists’ actions? To answer this question, we turn to platform caregivers’ and care coordinators’ per-spectives and experiences. Contrary to technologists’ aspirations touse algorithms to build a fairer, more transparent order, algorithmic staffing practices in fact created new conditions of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. First, we focus on evaluation practices.CareTech’s app for caregivers displays ratings across several met-rics related to operational aspects of care delivery (i.e., timeliness,consistency, application usage, and call-offs). The platform also sends weekly caregiver evaluation surveys to coordinators but does not share this feedback directly with caregivers. Further, caregivers rarely received qualitative feedback regarding the quality of care they provided. Caregivers discussed how these aspects of platform design contributed to ambiguity regarding insight into their perfor-mance, while coordinators approached completing survey-based caregiver evaluations with ambivalence. Second, we analyze care-givers’ interactions with CareTech’s staffing practices. Caregivers described experiencing collapsed boundaries between working and personal time. Despite these new challenges, the caregivers and coordinators we interviewed did not mention a desire to leave. .4.3.1 Ambiguity and Ambivalence. While caregivers described providing care as meaningful and were generally content with the conditions they faced on the platform, they discussed a lack of clarity regarding expectations and performance. As Hayden said:I believe that the clients, they also rate us after every shift. So then if we get rated lowly every time or pretty consistently, I’m sure they will reach out tous...I don’t know that it helps us rate our care and how well we’re doing with our clients, but I don't know how else they could do that...you hear stories of people who are dissatisfied with their care, and that's hard to tell.It was only after connecting with other caregivers that Hayden Learned that it was possible to request a performance evaluation form CareTech. Further, the opacity of metrics created feelings of worry for care-givers about their performance. As a new caregiver on the platform,Hazel worried about a low client consistency rating and discussed needing to take the initiative to understand why she received low ratings across other metrics. Puzzled about low application usage ratings, Hazel described needing to reach out to CareTech to understand “what [she] was missing.” CareTech’s communication and evaluation practices created unclear situations with multiple interpretations and required additional labor on the part of caregivers to understand how care recipients experienced their care and how the platform judged their performance. Coordinators, on the other hand, discussed their own evaluation practices as infused with ambivalence—a finding that we found surprising given the intimate and impactful context of care for an older loved one. While coordinators described clear feelings about the care provided to loved ones, our interviewees responded to CareTech’s evaluation surveys inconsistently. Coordinators expressed satisfaction with the care that caregivers provided and thus did not feel a need to fill out the company’s weekly care-giver evaluation survey, described how these surveys were not as useful compared to in-person evaluations performed over more extended periods, or expressed that they did not feel their feedback through these outlets was listened to by CareTech. Phyllis—who lives with her care recipient—described that since the quality of care was so consistent, there was not a need to be very detailed in her evaluations: “they will send out those [surveys] weekly...soyou click on attentiveness, preparation, and I don’t remember what they all are. There’s about five of them. I don’t get very detailed.” On The other hand, Brooks—who did not live with his care recipient,and was dissatisfied with the consistency of staffing provided byCareTech—described feeling overwhelmed by the amount of eval-uating he was asked to do: “For each one of the caregivers that has been in, they’re asking for an opinion for eight to 10 caregivers everyMonday, on the same thing, the same people doing the same thing.I’ve had a hard time seeing the value on a weekly basis.” He saw more value in evaluations carried out over longer intervals as it had been before the acquisition. There used to be the quarterly report where they would actually go in and visit and come back and say,‘this has changed, or this looks like it’s changed’...when someone steps in four or five times a year those are the ones that can pick out some things.Opal, who uses CareTech to provide care to her husband, discussed her attitude towards the surveys: “Honestly, I ignore [the surveys]. It’s not something I want to do. I don’t know why. I know they're doing great.” These perspectives demonstrate a difference in the worth actors ascribed to particular evaluation practices, high-lighting a mismatch between technologists’, coordinators’, and care-givers’ perspectives. Other coordinators described non-use of CareTech’s evaluation infrastructure, even when there were striking departures from care expectations. Coordinators justified their approach by appealing to different moral frameworks. Riley said, “what did happen onetime, and I should probably be more tuned into it...there was one day when one of the caregivers didn’t show up at all. And I didn't know about it until the next day.” She justified the non-use through appeals to a domestic moral framework: “I’m not as hands-on, I’mnot looking at the app to see what they’re doing. I get my feedback on how they’re doing from my mom and dad.” Winnie, who relied on a caregiver to transport her mother to church on Sunday mornings, described situations where sometimes a caregiver assigned to the shift couldn’t drive or had no car. Even so, she did not fill out regular surveys, drawing on her experience as a business owner (industrial)to express that she understood the challenges of staffing shifts: “it’sa very hard thing to maneuver in the world that we’re walking in. We Own a small business. We employ 13 ladies, so I understand.” At the same time, she seemed to negatively moralize non-use: “I will be honest with you that a survey has come...I haven’t filled it out. So I Haven't done due diligence on my part. You know, so I’m going to own that part.” While some coordinators expressed frustration about consistency, communication, quality, and the efficacy of evaluation practices, they appealed to multiple moral frameworks to justify different uses of evaluation infrastructure.4.3.2 Work Practices and Professional Boundaries. Continued dis-cussion with caregivers provided insight into how the problems that technologists faced contributed to aspects of platform design.The need to fill open shifts and coordinate care work across multiple individuals—associated with an industrial moral framework—took precedence over other concerns. Francine’s account of interactions with CareTech provides an example of how the need to staff shifts devalued communication about performance: “they have never given me any feedback or evaluation, the only time they call is about the schedule, asking if you can work more.” We argue that technologists prioritization of needs associated with the industrial moral frame-work eroded the boundary between caregivers’ work and personal lives and changed care practices.For example, the platform uses a notification system to bring open shifts to caregivers’ attention. However, Pepper describe how the constant notification stream makes it difficult for her to differentiate between work and leisure time:I can tell they have a lot of shifts to fill in. Am I go-ing to be under pressure? They’ve asked me for five things, and you said no to all of them, it feels likeI should say yes to something now. It’s just a little harder to be either working or not working...when you see your phone in the morning and you see all those notifications there.Hayden described receiving “30 to 40” notifications a day from the app, even after reaching out to CareTech to express that they would not work any more shifts. Further, they described confu-sion and frustration regarding the processes by which shifts were initially assigned:I actually said no to [the shift], but they scheduled me anyway. Which was how I got a lot of my shifts,which was okay...I know sometimes it sounds weird,but I would say no to a shift, maybe they’d think thatI said yes.This account suggests that the platform does not allow for as much flexibility as technologists imagine.In contrast to legacy record-keeping procedures, where care-givers left paper-based care notes in clients’ homes, CareTech’splatform requires that caregivers describe their shifts upon clock-ing out in an electronic journal that is viewable by coordinators and other caregivers. While caregivers described that the journal helped them feel more prepared for each shift, they also described reading journal entries outside of working hours, which provided further evidence for blurred boundaries between work and personal life.For example, Chauncey described reading entries “at night, before Igo to bed, I start reading if I’m going to work the next morning.” In Addition, platform architecture requiring caregivers to complete these logs changed caregivers’ relationship to time spent on the job. Francine described how filling out the notes, especially in the time-sensitive context of a shift, placed pressure on how she spent time providing care: “if you clock out right at a minute after [your shift ends] they get you on that.” Efforts to avoid disciplinary action created new relationships to time: “I just always try to clock out a few minutes before because you get all these questions before closing out the app” (Francine). In these cases, platform architecture changed caregivers' relationships with their time both on and off the clock,which put caregivers under additional pressure.We found that aspects of platform and algorithm design create new forms of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. We argue that this results from a mismatch between technologists’ moral reasoning and that of other platform actors. In addition, the need to fill open shifts and coordinate work across many individuals pri-oritizes a logic of efficiency over concerns for caregiver job quality.Despite coordinators’ unmet expectations and new pressures that the platform placed on caregivers, both sets of actors maintain a commitment to the platform. A possible explanation for contin-ued attachment is the moral significance of ‘care.’ While the term carries various meanings across actors and situations, it may act as a resource that maintains a particular status quo by mitigating organized critique of or departure from the platform.

They referenced multiple interpretations of the term ‘care’ to resolve contradictions.We illustrate this point by first focusing on how technologists described the problems that they claim to solve. Then, we analyze the nature of the solutions they presented, highlighting how technolo-gists imbued different aspects of algorithm design and function with moral meanings. This finding demonstrates the interpretive flexibil-ity of technological artifacts. Finally, we turn to the perspectives of caregivers and coordinators. Their accounts show how algorithmic staffing practices created new forms of uncertainty—the mirror of technologists' stated intentions.4.1 Navigating Contextual ComplexityTechnologists drew on multiple moral frameworks to navigate expectations and demands, appealing to various interpretations of care’ to reconcile the contradictory pressures they face. The technologists we interviewed framed CareTech as a platform developed to address traditional home care agencies’ logistical and opera-tional challenges. In this context, they appealed to an industrial moral framework, framing their work as introducing greater levels of efficiency and rationalization to the home care industry. How-ever, many of the technologists we interviewed also framed their work in terms of a civic moral framework, critiquing prior staffing practices as subjective, opaque, unfair, and harmful to the material well-being of caregivers. Although these two narratives may appear contradictory, technologists unified these demands by appealing to the societal need for more care. For example, improvements inefficiency were discussed in terms of increasing the affordability of care while improving working conditions was imagined as growing the size of the caregiving workforce. We argue that technologists navigate complexity when creating and developing care algorithms by strategically appealing to justifications corresponding to differ-ent moral frameworks, drawing on multiple interpretations of a single term to move between them. Throughout this section, we draw attention to how technologists position algorithmic staffing practices as one solution to the problems they described.4.1.1 Platform Description & Motivations. The rhetoric that tech-nologists and company executives used to describe their motivation for building the platform appealed to domestic and social goods. In press releases and on the company website, CareTech’s execu-tives described their frustrations in searching for care for their own parents. Similarly, technologists invoked ideas of familial respon-sibility, relaying stories about their difficulties in finding care for aging parents. Technologists also drew on more civic-oriented no-tions of good, framing their work with reference to positive social change. For example, Richard described, “being part of something that can have a positive impact on society.” The company’s mission statement, was described as ‘improving care in society6, highlight-ing the significance of a single moral concept in technologists discourse.In discussing the company’s strategy, the technologists we in-terviewed described CareTech as a “platform,” “communication company,” or “logistical engine,”, foregrounding CareTech’s use of digital technology to improve efficiency, and framed their work asa response to logistical challenges in the home care industry. Aiden described what he framed as the company’s main value proposition:I think the big sort of sell is, it is getting harder and harder to operate care. I think it is getting more expensive...the core value proposition is where we are trying to figure out how to build a platform around doing this, and helping agencies focus more on their relationships with their communities and customers.He elaborated that, by centralizing operations, CareTech offers partner agencies relief from work that is “consuming and grueling,whether it’s paperwork, management, documentation, staffing, lo-gistics, or being on call all the time.” By filling this role, CareTech‘frees up agencies to both source customers and maintain that rela-tionship and kind of connection’ (Aiden). Repeated references to the relationship between CareTech and the agencies with which it partners serve two purposes. First, they identify areas whereCareTech uses technology to increase efficiency in the home care industry. This problem formulation provides the background for how organizational solutions are framed. Second, they format a division of labor. In this account, partner agencies are positioned as responsible for managing relationships in local markets, while the platform oversees aspects of labor control and management.Here, technologists frame the platform’s work in industrial terms and partner agencies in domestic terms. 4.1.2 Staffing Practices as Solutions. As they justified their work,technologists also blended elements from multiple moral frame-works. Specifically, they simultaneously appealed to notions of market dominance and civic responsibility. This overlap materialized as Robert, a data scientist, stated that the company’s scale offered a ‘unified view across markets’ and provided access to a sufficient amount of data to use statistical techniques to ‘learn from the data to provide better home care’, serving as a “competitive dif-ferentiator in the market.” In addition, Floyd framed the company's size as affording more ‘careful’ staffing practice:From a systemic perspective, when you are bigger you have these systems in place, and you do not have to guilt somebody into working a shift. If you need a shift filled, you have a stable of hundreds of caregivers you can reach out to, it is just a matter of how much bonus you have to put on it.These rhetorical strategies demonstrate how technologists draw on multiple moral frameworks to present their work as solutions to different problems.Building on discussions of CareTech’s organizational strategy,technologists most concretely articulated their efforts toward ‘im-proving care in society’ through labor management. They started these discussions by problematizing caregiver job quality under legacy home care practices as associated with low wages, few ben-efits, rigid scheduling practices, and little recognition of caregivers efforts. Kennedy critiqued legacy staffing practices on the grounds of fairness and transparency:There’s a lot of favoritism that happens. There’s a lack of transparency. And so as you can imagine, the caregivers who work the most shifts, they’re able to earn the most amount of money. And that’s really helping to improve their lives and livelihoods. Other technologists framed algorithmic staffing as a solution to the legacy staffing practices that Kennedy identified as opaque and unfair. While Kennedy incorporated concerns about material well-being into her critiques, other technologists generally avoided discussing their efforts toward increasing caregiver job quality in terms of a market-based moral framework. This may have resulted from the market constraints of care, where the price for private pay home care is inaccessible for many families. Aria explainedthat raising wages for caregivers would make the price of care“unpayable” by many clients. 4.1.3 Professionalizing Care. Instead, technologists framed their efforts as attempts to improve caregivers’ status and provide them with a career. Aria noted that improving the collective status of caregivers was part of CareTech’s mission since its founding, em-phasizing challenging aspects of the job:I think that a really big piece of what CareTech is try-ing to do and has been trying to do since the beginning you know, elevate the profession of caregiving. Andtruly treat it a profession instead of just a job...because it's a difficult, emotionally intense, sometimes physi-cally intense thing to do.Floyd described further aspirations to elevate caregivers’ status through professionalization:I would say that [career] is a north star for us. I think everyone views that as an innovation that we can and should make, and the profession is worth it... we're working towards it, but we haven’t actually gotten there yet.These discussions highlight the links that technologists establish between different moral frameworks as they respond to a complex set of challenges. While they expressed concern about the value that care holds in society, increasing the pecuniary value of car was viewed as infeasible. Technologists responded to this problem by appealing to the status of the profession. However, technologists most defined solutions came in the form of staffing algorithms.4.2 Datafying CareWe unpack staffing practices at CareTech, which we argue are emblematic of technological solutionism. Our analysis reveals that technologists associated different aspects of staffing algorithms with different moral frameworks. We argue that how decisions are made about who is best suited for particular shifts—and why—is changing with the advent and implementation of algorithmic staffing tools as technologists prioritize efficiency. However, discussions with technologists show that there are tensions present in the use of algorithms. On the one hand, technologists discussed their work in terms of trying to increase caregiver performance. Performance Evaluation metrics break care into a set of constituent elements closely aligned with operational efficiency (an appeal to the indus-trial moral framework). On the other hand, technologists described their work as oriented toward establishing long-term relationships between caregivers and care recipients (an appeal to the domestic moral framework).The metrics and measurements that support algorithmic staffing practices are most closely associated with notions of productivity and operational efficiency. Technologists presented one part of their work as oriented toward increasing the “performance, or perceived performance of the caregiver” (Floyd). They described how this work is accomplished by measuring: (1) timeliness (how frequently a caregiver arrives to a shift on time); (2) consistency (adherence to schedule shifts); (3) application usage (whether or not the caregiver uses the application to clock in to and out of shifts and evaluate care recipient well-being); and (4) call-offs (shifts not released seven days in advance). While this evaluation practice makes care legible based on a discrete set of metrics, the composition of these metrics is oriented toward operational efficiency rather than the experiences of care recipients or care coordinators.Technologists contrasted their work with platforms in the ride-hailing industry7, describing how their work was motivated by the desire to establish long-term relationships between caregivers and care recipients. They referenced algorithms in terms that framed care as a holistic practice, often comparing the product of their work to other intimate relationships. Staffing algorithms have a role at two main sites: as initial schedules were made and when other caregivers called off their shifts. When caregivers are scheduled during their onboarding, staff members at CareTech use algorithmic recommendation systems to match caregivers with care recipients.In both cases, platform architects compared the matching process to other intimate relations between caregivers and care recipients.In Sandra’s words: Once the data are all collected, [the algorithm] gives us a list of caregivers, and it was ranked by most likely to be picked up by the caregiver...there is a...I don't want to say negotiating, but there are conversations that go back and forth. Because it does become an arranged marriage when you’re putting it inside thehome.In instances where shifts opened up with clients, the platform gives caregivers the option to pick up shifts with these clients through a user interface that Floyd described as “not not tinder 8 inspired. In advancing these relationship-based arguments, technologists define quality care by referencing domestic relationships between caregivers and care recipients.On the one hand, technologists seek to build a platform that effi-ciently delivers consistent care to a growing number of older adult care recipients. On the other, they describe their work as motivated by a desire to optimize relationships between caregivers and care recipients. At the same time, they framed their efforts as improving fairness, accountability, and transparency in staffing practices. Pair-ing discussions of metrics—which break care down into constituent elements associated with industrial efficiency—with algorithms staffing practices—which technologists use to frame evaluation in domestic terms—reveals that these actors associate different parts of their job with distinct moral frameworks to meet a complex set of demands. Further, interviews with caregivers and coordinators reveal that these performance evaluation criteria and platform staffing practices are a source of tension and stress.4.3 Platform AsymmetriesWhat are the consequences of technologists’ actions? To answer this question, we turn to platform caregivers’ and care coordinators’ per-spectives and experiences. Contrary to technologists’ aspirations touse algorithms to build a fairer, more transparent order, algorithmic staffing practices in fact created new conditions of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. First, we focus on evaluation practices.CareTech’s app for caregivers displays ratings across several met-rics related to operational aspects of care delivery (i.e., timeliness,consistency, application usage, and call-offs). The platform also sends weekly caregiver evaluation surveys to coordinators but does not share this feedback directly with caregivers. Further, caregivers rarely received qualitative feedback regarding the quality of care they provided. Caregivers discussed how these aspects of platform design contributed to ambiguity regarding insight into their perfor-mance, while coordinators approached completing survey-based caregiver evaluations with ambivalence. Second, we analyze care-givers’ interactions with CareTech’s staffing practices. Caregivers described experiencing collapsed boundaries between working and personal time. Despite these new challenges, the caregivers and coordinators we interviewed did not mention a desire to leave. .4.3.1 Ambiguity and Ambivalence. While caregivers described providing care as meaningful and were generally content with the conditions they faced on the platform, they discussed a lack of clarity regarding expectations and performance. As Hayden said:I believe that the clients, they also rate us after every shift. So then if we get rated lowly every time or pretty consistently, I’m sure they will reach out tous...I don’t know that it helps us rate our care and how well we’re doing with our clients, but I don't know how else they could do that...you hear stories of people who are dissatisfied with their care, and that's hard to tell.It was only after connecting with other caregivers that Hayden Learned that it was possible to request a performance evaluation form CareTech. Further, the opacity of metrics created feelings of worry for care-givers about their performance. As a new caregiver on the platform,Hazel worried about a low client consistency rating and discussed needing to take the initiative to understand why she received low ratings across other metrics. Puzzled about low application usage ratings, Hazel described needing to reach out to CareTech to understand “what [she] was missing.” CareTech’s communication and evaluation practices created unclear situations with multiple interpretations and required additional labor on the part of caregivers to understand how care recipients experienced their care and how the platform judged their performance. Coordinators, on the other hand, discussed their own evaluation practices as infused with ambivalence—a finding that we found surprising given the intimate and impactful context of care for an older loved one. While coordinators described clear feelings about the care provided to loved ones, our interviewees responded to CareTech’s evaluation surveys inconsistently. Coordinators expressed satisfaction with the care that caregivers provided and thus did not feel a need to fill out the company’s weekly care-giver evaluation survey, described how these surveys were not as useful compared to in-person evaluations performed over more extended periods, or expressed that they did not feel their feedback through these outlets was listened to by CareTech. Phyllis—who lives with her care recipient—described that since the quality of care was so consistent, there was not a need to be very detailed in her evaluations: “they will send out those [surveys] weekly...soyou click on attentiveness, preparation, and I don’t remember what they all are. There’s about five of them. I don’t get very detailed.” On The other hand, Brooks—who did not live with his care recipient,and was dissatisfied with the consistency of staffing provided byCareTech—described feeling overwhelmed by the amount of eval-uating he was asked to do: “For each one of the caregivers that has been in, they’re asking for an opinion for eight to 10 caregivers everyMonday, on the same thing, the same people doing the same thing.I’ve had a hard time seeing the value on a weekly basis.” He saw more value in evaluations carried out over longer intervals as it had been before the acquisition. There used to be the quarterly report where they would actually go in and visit and come back and say,‘this has changed, or this looks like it’s changed’...when someone steps in four or five times a year those are the ones that can pick out some things.Opal, who uses CareTech to provide care to her husband, discussed her attitude towards the surveys: “Honestly, I ignore [the surveys]. It’s not something I want to do. I don’t know why. I know they're doing great.” These perspectives demonstrate a difference in the worth actors ascribed to particular evaluation practices, high-lighting a mismatch between technologists’, coordinators’, and care-givers’ perspectives. Other coordinators described non-use of CareTech’s evaluation infrastructure, even when there were striking departures from care expectations. Coordinators justified their approach by appealing to different moral frameworks. Riley said, “what did happen onetime, and I should probably be more tuned into it...there was one day when one of the caregivers didn’t show up at all. And I didn't know about it until the next day.” She justified the non-use through appeals to a domestic moral framework: “I’m not as hands-on, I’mnot looking at the app to see what they’re doing. I get my feedback on how they’re doing from my mom and dad.” Winnie, who relied on a caregiver to transport her mother to church on Sunday mornings, described situations where sometimes a caregiver assigned to the shift couldn’t drive or had no car. Even so, she did not fill out regular surveys, drawing on her experience as a business owner (industrial)to express that she understood the challenges of staffing shifts: “it’sa very hard thing to maneuver in the world that we’re walking in. We Own a small business. We employ 13 ladies, so I understand.” At the same time, she seemed to negatively moralize non-use: “I will be honest with you that a survey has come...I haven’t filled it out. So I Haven't done due diligence on my part. You know, so I’m going to own that part.” While some coordinators expressed frustration about consistency, communication, quality, and the efficacy of evaluation practices, they appealed to multiple moral frameworks to justify different uses of evaluation infrastructure.4.3.2 Work Practices and Professional Boundaries. Continued dis-cussion with caregivers provided insight into how the problems that technologists faced contributed to aspects of platform design.The need to fill open shifts and coordinate care work across multiple individuals—associated with an industrial moral framework—took precedence over other concerns. Francine’s account of interactions with CareTech provides an example of how the need to staff shifts devalued communication about performance: “they have never given me any feedback or evaluation, the only time they call is about the schedule, asking if you can work more.” We argue that technologists prioritization of needs associated with the industrial moral frame-work eroded the boundary between caregivers’ work and personal lives and changed care practices.For example, the platform uses a notification system to bring open shifts to caregivers’ attention. However, Pepper describe how the constant notification stream makes it difficult for her to differentiate between work and leisure time:I can tell they have a lot of shifts to fill in. Am I go-ing to be under pressure? They’ve asked me for five things, and you said no to all of them, it feels likeI should say yes to something now. It’s just a little harder to be either working or not working...when you see your phone in the morning and you see all those notifications there.Hayden described receiving “30 to 40” notifications a day from the app, even after reaching out to CareTech to express that they would not work any more shifts. Further, they described confu-sion and frustration regarding the processes by which shifts were initially assigned:I actually said no to [the shift], but they scheduled me anyway. Which was how I got a lot of my shifts,which was okay...I know sometimes it sounds weird,but I would say no to a shift, maybe they’d think thatI said yes.This account suggests that the platform does not allow for as much flexibility as technologists imagine.In contrast to legacy record-keeping procedures, where care-givers left paper-based care notes in clients’ homes, CareTech’splatform requires that caregivers describe their shifts upon clock-ing out in an electronic journal that is viewable by coordinators and other caregivers. While caregivers described that the journal helped them feel more prepared for each shift, they also described reading journal entries outside of working hours, which provided further evidence for blurred boundaries between work and personal life.For example, Chauncey described reading entries “at night, before Igo to bed, I start reading if I’m going to work the next morning.” In Addition, platform architecture requiring caregivers to complete these logs changed caregivers’ relationship to time spent on the job. Francine described how filling out the notes, especially in the time-sensitive context of a shift, placed pressure on how she spent time providing care: “if you clock out right at a minute after [your shift ends] they get you on that.” Efforts to avoid disciplinary action created new relationships to time: “I just always try to clock out a few minutes before because you get all these questions before closing out the app” (Francine). In these cases, platform architecture changed caregivers' relationships with their time both on and off the clock,which put caregivers under additional pressure.We found that aspects of platform and algorithm design create new forms of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. We argue that this results from a mismatch between technologists’ moral reasoning and that of other platform actors. In addition, the need to fill open shifts and coordinate work across many individuals pri-oritizes a logic of efficiency over concerns for caregiver job quality.Despite coordinators’ unmet expectations and new pressures that the platform placed on caregivers, both sets of actors maintain a commitment to the platform. A possible explanation for contin-ued attachment is the moral significance of ‘care.’ While the term carries various meanings across actors and situations, it may act as a resource that maintains a particular status quo by mitigating organized critique of or departure from the platform.

15,CivicGood,Goal,"The subject of our case study, CareTech4, is one of several start-upsthat are credited with “reinventing the [home care] agency model”[22]. Prior to data collection, CareTech acquired StayHome, a traditional home care agency franchise. To contextualize our findings,we briefly discuss CareTech’s business model.CareTech partners with traditional home care agencies to support back-end administrative, legal, compliance, and logistics functions in exchange for a share of partner agencies’ revenue, employing caregivers directly. Caregivers assist with activities of daily living(i.e., bathing, dressing, getting in or out of a bed or chair, walking,using the toilet, eating) [43], and instrumental activities of daily living (i.e., cooking, cleaning, transportation, laundry, managing finances) [46]. CareTech’s use of algorithms to match caregivers to care recipients is central to our case. When we started data collection, CareTech’s technology platform had recently been im-plemented at StayHome’s company-owned agencies, providing a unique opportunity to investigate care algorithm implementation.In this paper, we focus primarily on CareTech’s staffing prac-tices. CareTech uses metrics and algorithms, along with human management, to staff shifts. Staffing algorithms have a role at two main sites: as initial schedules were made and when other care-givers called off their shifts. When caregivers are scheduled during their onboarding, staff members at CareTech use algorithmic recommendation systems to match caregivers with care recipients. Evaluation metrics (i.e., timeliness, consistency, application usage,and call-offs), along with other data (e.g., caregiver commute time,number of complaints) are used to match caregivers and care recipients. Coordinators receive weekly surveys about the quality of care provided, and provide responses on a linear scale5. After IRB approval, we recruited participants—technologists (n =14), caregivers (n = 9), and coordinators (n = 7)—through a partnership with CareTech and StayHome for interviews using convenience and purposive sampling [10]. StayHome’s research staff arranged site visit and helped recruit participants. We provided a brief description of the study and a screening questionnaire distributed amongst the caregivers and coordinators over email. This approach provided an opportunity to learn from technologists, caregivers,coordinators who were enthusiastic about sharing their experi-ences with the platform. Table 2 and table 3 provide an overview of participant profiles.(1) Technologists: Technologists consisted of software engi-neers, designers, product managers, and data and opera-tions workers. Software engineers talked about buildingCareTech’s features and the company’s history. Designers Develop CareTech’s front-end user experience for caregivers.Designers, the operations team, and a product manager described how they approached curating the caregiver experi-ence. The data scientists, data analysts, and data stewards dis-cussed the metrics used to measure caregiver performance,the data that staffing algorithms use, and how algorithms work in practice.(2) Caregivers: We use the term ‘caregivers’ to refer to the people employed by CareTech to provide care for pay.(3) Coordinators: The term ‘coordinators’ refers to people that pay for CareTech’s services and coordinate their delivery,usually on behalf of an older loved one. Recruiting interview participants through a partnership with Stay-Home and CareTech potentially biased results toward more positive perspectives of organizational practices. Caregivers and coordina-tors with more negative views about the company may have been reluctant to share their opinions or participate in interviews alto-gether due to fears of retaliation from the platform. Convenience Sampling limited the extent to which we were able to understand differences across demographic subgroups. Future work should explore this issue. Further, recruitment overlooked the perspectives of care coordinators and caregivers who have left the platform due to difficulties This study draws on data gathered from one week of observations performed in July 2022 and 30 interviews conducted between May2022 and August 2022. We conducted in-depth interviews to understand the cultural inputs that shape algorithm design and the implications for caregivers and coordinators. Interviews are well-suited for understanding social dimensions of how people interpret the world and take actions based on those interpretations [64]. Interviews with technology workers show how they make sense of their work and build systems [67], and interviews with caregivers and coordinators show that care practices diverge from organizational philosophy [53]. After several interviews, one researcher visitedStayHome’s global headquarters and a company-owned agency,located in a major Midwestern city in the U.S. The researcher toured the company’s offices and met with support staff. In addition, theresearcher engaged these actors in informal conversations to learn how StayHome and CareTech operate. To understand how the plat-form is presented to caregivers and what aspects of paid care work are emphasized, the researcher observed a caregiver training ses-sion on lifting and transferring techniques at one of StayHome’scompany-owned franchises and attended a virtual onboarding ses-sion with CareTech in the afternoon.We developed the interview guide with interest in valuation and evaluation practices as they occur on CareTech’s platform. Treating valuation as a moral outlook, we drew on practice-oriented approaches to understanding how different actors conceptualize and contribute value in labor contexts [36]. Examining the practices of the people that develop platforms and those who are subject to their architecture provides an opportunity to identify the underlying justifications and actions that shape and transform care work as it occurs on the ground. Interview questions thus sought to elicit interviewees' daily practices, what elements of their work they described as most important, the least favorite aspects of their work,and their ideological orientation towards the concept of ‘care.’After obtaining consent, we recorded the interviews, which lasted between 45 and 90 minutes and took place mainly over Zoom. However, we did interview several caregivers and one coordinator in person. Team members iteratively refined these themes through discussion and mapped them to the EoW framework. We used a third-party qualitative coding tool (NVivo) to complete the coding process. To make theoretical sense of the data, we returned to the literature and iterated between data and extant research. Our findings indicate that technologists drew on several economies of worth—which we refer to as moral frameworks—to navigate the seemingly irreconcilable demands of home care. They referenced multiple interpretations of the term ‘care’ to resolve contradictions.We illustrate this point by first focusing on how technologists described the problems that they claim to solve. Then, we analyze the nature of the solutions they presented, highlighting how technolo-gists imbued different aspects of algorithm design and function with moral meanings. This finding demonstrates the interpretive flexibil-ity of technological artifacts. Finally, we turn to the perspectives of caregivers and coordinators. Their accounts show how algorithmic staffing practices created new forms of uncertainty—the mirror of technologists' stated intentions.4.1 Navigating Contextual ComplexityTechnologists drew on multiple moral frameworks to navigate expectations and demands, appealing to various interpretations of care’ to reconcile the contradictory pressures they face.

They described how this work is accomplished by measuring: (1) timeliness (how frequently a caregiver arrives to a shift on time); (2) consistency (adherence to schedule shifts); (3) application usage (whether or not the caregiver uses the application to clock in to and out of shifts and evaluate care recipient well-being); and (4) call-offs (shifts not released seven days in advance). While this evaluation practice makes care legible based on a discrete set of metrics, the composition of these metrics is oriented toward operational efficiency rather than the experiences of care recipients or care coordinators.Technologists contrasted their work with platforms in the ride-hailing industry7, describing how their work was motivated by the desire to establish long-term relationships between caregivers and care recipients. They referenced algorithms in terms that framed care as a holistic practice, often comparing the product of their work to other intimate relationships. Staffing algorithms have a role at two main sites: as initial schedules were made and when other caregivers called off their shifts. When caregivers are scheduled during their onboarding, staff members at CareTech use algorithmic recommendation systems to match caregivers with care recipients.In both cases, platform architects compared the matching process to other intimate relations between caregivers and care recipients.In Sandra’s words: Once the data are all collected, [the algorithm] gives us a list of caregivers, and it was ranked by most likely to be picked up by the caregiver...there is a...I don't want to say negotiating, but there are conversations that go back and forth. Because it does become an arranged marriage when you’re putting it inside thehome.In instances where shifts opened up with clients, the platform gives caregivers the option to pick up shifts with these clients through a user interface that Floyd described as “not not tinder 8 inspired. In advancing these relationship-based arguments, technologists define quality care by referencing domestic relationships between caregivers and care recipients.On the one hand, technologists seek to build a platform that effi-ciently delivers consistent care to a growing number of older adult care recipients. On the other, they describe their work as motivated by a desire to optimize relationships between caregivers and care recipients. At the same time, they framed their efforts as improving fairness, accountability, and transparency in staffing practices. Pair-ing discussions of metrics—which break care down into constituent elements associated with industrial efficiency—with algorithms staffing practices—which technologists use to frame evaluation in domestic terms—reveals that these actors associate different parts of their job with distinct moral frameworks to meet a complex set of demands. Further, interviews with caregivers and coordinators reveal that these performance evaluation criteria and platform staffing practices are a source of tension and stress.4.3 Platform AsymmetriesWhat are the consequences of technologists’ actions? To answer this question, we turn to platform caregivers’ and care coordinators’ per-spectives and experiences. Contrary to technologists’ aspirations touse algorithms to build a fairer, more transparent order, algorithmic staffing practices in fact created new conditions of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. First, we focus on evaluation practices.CareTech’s app for caregivers displays ratings across several met-rics related to operational aspects of care delivery (i.e., timeliness,consistency, application usage, and call-offs). The platform also sends weekly caregiver evaluation surveys to coordinators but does not share this feedback directly with caregivers. Further, caregivers rarely received qualitative feedback regarding the quality of care they provided. Caregivers discussed how these aspects of platform design contributed to ambiguity regarding insight into their perfor-mance, while coordinators approached completing survey-based caregiver evaluations with ambivalence. Second, we analyze care-givers’ interactions with CareTech’s staffing practices. Caregivers described experiencing collapsed boundaries between working and personal time. Despite these new challenges, the caregivers and coordinators we interviewed did not mention a desire to leave. .4.3.1 Ambiguity and Ambivalence. While caregivers described providing care as meaningful and were generally content with the conditions they faced on the platform, they discussed a lack of clarity regarding expectations and performance. As Hayden said:I believe that the clients, they also rate us after every shift. So then if we get rated lowly every time or pretty consistently, I’m sure they will reach out tous...I don’t know that it helps us rate our care and how well we’re doing with our clients, but I don't know how else they could do that...you hear stories of people who are dissatisfied with their care, and that's hard to tell.It was only after connecting with other caregivers that Hayden Learned that it was possible to request a performance evaluation form CareTech. Further, the opacity of metrics created feelings of worry for care-givers about their performance. As a new caregiver on the platform,Hazel worried about a low client consistency rating and discussed needing to take the initiative to understand why she received low ratings across other metrics. Puzzled about low application usage ratings, Hazel described needing to reach out to CareTech to understand “what [she] was missing.” CareTech’s communication and evaluation practices created unclear situations with multiple interpretations and required additional labor on the part of caregivers to understand how care recipients experienced their care and how the platform judged their performance. Coordinators, on the other hand, discussed their own evaluation practices as infused with ambivalence—a finding that we found surprising given the intimate and impactful context of care for an older loved one. While coordinators described clear feelings about the care provided to loved ones, our interviewees responded to CareTech’s evaluation surveys inconsistently. Coordinators expressed satisfaction with the care that caregivers provided and thus did not feel a need to fill out the company’s weekly care-giver evaluation survey, described how these surveys were not as useful compared to in-person evaluations performed over more extended periods, or expressed that they did not feel their feedback through these outlets was listened to by CareTech. Phyllis—who lives with her care recipient—described that since the quality of care was so consistent, there was not a need to be very detailed in her evaluations: “they will send out those [surveys] weekly...soyou click on attentiveness, preparation, and I don’t remember what they all are. There’s about five of them. I don’t get very detailed.” On The other hand, Brooks—who did not live with his care recipient,and was dissatisfied with the consistency of staffing provided byCareTech—described feeling overwhelmed by the amount of eval-uating he was asked to do: “For each one of the caregivers that has been in, they’re asking for an opinion for eight to 10 caregivers everyMonday, on the same thing, the same people doing the same thing.I’ve had a hard time seeing the value on a weekly basis.” He saw more value in evaluations carried out over longer intervals as it had been before the acquisition. There used to be the quarterly report where they would actually go in and visit and come back and say,‘this has changed, or this looks like it’s changed’...when someone steps in four or five times a year those are the ones that can pick out some things.Opal, who uses CareTech to provide care to her husband, discussed her attitude towards the surveys: “Honestly, I ignore [the surveys]. It’s not something I want to do. I don’t know why. I know they're doing great.” These perspectives demonstrate a difference in the worth actors ascribed to particular evaluation practices, high-lighting a mismatch between technologists’, coordinators’, and care-givers’ perspectives. Other coordinators described non-use of CareTech’s evaluation infrastructure, even when there were striking departures from care expectations. Coordinators justified their approach by appealing to different moral frameworks. Riley said, “what did happen onetime, and I should probably be more tuned into it...there was one day when one of the caregivers didn’t show up at all. And I didn't know about it until the next day.” She justified the non-use through appeals to a domestic moral framework: “I’m not as hands-on, I’mnot looking at the app to see what they’re doing. I get my feedback on how they’re doing from my mom and dad.” Winnie, who relied on a caregiver to transport her mother to church on Sunday mornings, described situations where sometimes a caregiver assigned to the shift couldn’t drive or had no car. Even so, she did not fill out regular surveys, drawing on her experience as a business owner (industrial)to express that she understood the challenges of staffing shifts: “it’sa very hard thing to maneuver in the world that we’re walking in. We Own a small business. We employ 13 ladies, so I understand.” At the same time, she seemed to negatively moralize non-use: “I will be honest with you that a survey has come...I haven’t filled it out. So I Haven't done due diligence on my part. You know, so I’m going to own that part.” While some coordinators expressed frustration about consistency, communication, quality, and the efficacy of evaluation practices, they appealed to multiple moral frameworks to justify different uses of evaluation infrastructure.4.3.2 Work Practices and Professional Boundaries. Continued dis-cussion with caregivers provided insight into how the problems that technologists faced contributed to aspects of platform design.The need to fill open shifts and coordinate care work across multiple individuals—associated with an industrial moral framework—took precedence over other concerns. Francine’s account of interactions with CareTech provides an example of how the need to staff shifts devalued communication about performance: “they have never given me any feedback or evaluation, the only time they call is about the schedule, asking if you can work more.” We argue that technologists prioritization of needs associated with the industrial moral frame-work eroded the boundary between caregivers’ work and personal lives and changed care practices.For example, the platform uses a notification system to bring open shifts to caregivers’ attention. However, Pepper describe how the constant notification stream makes it difficult for her to differentiate between work and leisure time:I can tell they have a lot of shifts to fill in. Am I go-ing to be under pressure? They’ve asked me for five things, and you said no to all of them, it feels likeI should say yes to something now. It’s just a little harder to be either working or not working...when you see your phone in the morning and you see all those notifications there.Hayden described receiving “30 to 40” notifications a day from the app, even after reaching out to CareTech to express that they would not work any more shifts. Further, they described confu-sion and frustration regarding the processes by which shifts were initially assigned:I actually said no to [the shift], but they scheduled me anyway. Which was how I got a lot of my shifts,which was okay...I know sometimes it sounds weird,but I would say no to a shift, maybe they’d think thatI said yes.This account suggests that the platform does not allow for as much flexibility as technologists imagine.In contrast to legacy record-keeping procedures, where care-givers left paper-based care notes in clients’ homes, CareTech’splatform requires that caregivers describe their shifts upon clock-ing out in an electronic journal that is viewable by coordinators and other caregivers. While caregivers described that the journal helped them feel more prepared for each shift, they also described reading journal entries outside of working hours, which provided further evidence for blurred boundaries between work and personal life.For example, Chauncey described reading entries “at night, before Igo to bed, I start reading if I’m going to work the next morning.” In Addition, platform architecture requiring caregivers to complete these logs changed caregivers’ relationship to time spent on the job. Francine described how filling out the notes, especially in the time-sensitive context of a shift, placed pressure on how she spent time providing care: “if you clock out right at a minute after [your shift ends] they get you on that.” Efforts to avoid disciplinary action created new relationships to time: “I just always try to clock out a few minutes before because you get all these questions before closing out the app” (Francine). In these cases, platform architecture changed caregivers' relationships with their time both on and off the clock,which put caregivers under additional pressure.We found that aspects of platform and algorithm design create new forms of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. We argue that this results from a mismatch between technologists’ moral reasoning and that of other platform actors. In addition, the need to fill open shifts and coordinate work across many individuals pri-oritizes a logic of efficiency over concerns for caregiver job quality.Despite coordinators’ unmet expectations and new pressures that the platform placed on caregivers, both sets of actors maintain a commitment to the platform. A possible explanation for contin-ued attachment is the moral significance of ‘care.’ While the term carries various meanings across actors and situations, it may act as a resource that maintains a particular status quo by mitigating organized critique of or departure from the platform.

16,MarketDominance,Causal_Theory,"The subject of our case study, CareTech4, is one of several start-upsthat are credited with “reinventing the [home care] agency model”[22]. Prior to data collection, CareTech acquired StayHome, a traditional home care agency franchise. To contextualize our findings,we briefly discuss CareTech’s business model.CareTech partners with traditional home care agencies to support back-end administrative, legal, compliance, and logistics functions in exchange for a share of partner agencies’ revenue, employing caregivers directly. Caregivers assist with activities of daily living(i.e., bathing, dressing, getting in or out of a bed or chair, walking,using the toilet, eating) [43], and instrumental activities of daily living (i.e., cooking, cleaning, transportation, laundry, managing finances) [46]. CareTech’s use of algorithms to match caregivers to care recipients is central to our case. When we started data collection, CareTech’s technology platform had recently been im-plemented at StayHome’s company-owned agencies, providing a unique opportunity to investigate care algorithm implementation.In this paper, we focus primarily on CareTech’s staffing prac-tices. CareTech uses metrics and algorithms, along with human management, to staff shifts. Staffing algorithms have a role at two main sites: as initial schedules were made and when other care-givers called off their shifts. When caregivers are scheduled during their onboarding, staff members at CareTech use algorithmic recommendation systems to match caregivers with care recipients. Evaluation metrics (i.e., timeliness, consistency, application usage,and call-offs), along with other data (e.g., caregiver commute time,number of complaints) are used to match caregivers and care recipients. Coordinators receive weekly surveys about the quality of care provided, and provide responses on a linear scale5. After IRB approval, we recruited participants—technologists (n =14), caregivers (n = 9), and coordinators (n = 7)—through a partnership with CareTech and StayHome for interviews using convenience and purposive sampling [10]. StayHome’s research staff arranged site visit and helped recruit participants. We provided a brief description of the study and a screening questionnaire distributed amongst the caregivers and coordinators over email. This approach provided an opportunity to learn from technologists, caregivers,coordinators who were enthusiastic about sharing their experi-ences with the platform. Table 2 and table 3 provide an overview of participant profiles.(1) Technologists: Technologists consisted of software engi-neers, designers, product managers, and data and opera-tions workers. Software engineers talked about buildingCareTech’s features and the company’s history. Designers Develop CareTech’s front-end user experience for caregivers.Designers, the operations team, and a product manager described how they approached curating the caregiver experi-ence. The data scientists, data analysts, and data stewards dis-cussed the metrics used to measure caregiver performance,the data that staffing algorithms use, and how algorithms work in practice.(2) Caregivers: We use the term ‘caregivers’ to refer to the people employed by CareTech to provide care for pay.(3) Coordinators: The term ‘coordinators’ refers to people that pay for CareTech’s services and coordinate their delivery,usually on behalf of an older loved one. Recruiting interview participants through a partnership with Stay-Home and CareTech potentially biased results toward more positive perspectives of organizational practices. Caregivers and coordina-tors with more negative views about the company may have been reluctant to share their opinions or participate in interviews alto-gether due to fears of retaliation from the platform. Convenience Sampling limited the extent to which we were able to understand differences across demographic subgroups. Future work should explore this issue. Further, recruitment overlooked the perspectives of care coordinators and caregivers who have left the platform due to difficulties This study draws on data gathered from one week of observations performed in July 2022 and 30 interviews conducted between May2022 and August 2022. We conducted in-depth interviews to understand the cultural inputs that shape algorithm design and the implications for caregivers and coordinators. Interviews are well-suited for understanding social dimensions of how people interpret the world and take actions based on those interpretations [64]. Interviews with technology workers show how they make sense of their work and build systems [67], and interviews with caregivers and coordinators show that care practices diverge from organizational philosophy [53]. After several interviews, one researcher visitedStayHome’s global headquarters and a company-owned agency,located in a major Midwestern city in the U.S. The researcher toured the company’s offices and met with support staff. In addition, theresearcher engaged these actors in informal conversations to learn how StayHome and CareTech operate. To understand how the plat-form is presented to caregivers and what aspects of paid care work are emphasized, the researcher observed a caregiver training ses-sion on lifting and transferring techniques at one of StayHome’scompany-owned franchises and attended a virtual onboarding ses-sion with CareTech in the afternoon.We developed the interview guide with interest in valuation and evaluation practices as they occur on CareTech’s platform. Treating valuation as a moral outlook, we drew on practice-oriented approaches to understanding how different actors conceptualize and contribute value in labor contexts [36]. Examining the practices of the people that develop platforms and those who are subject to their architecture provides an opportunity to identify the underlying justifications and actions that shape and transform care work as it occurs on the ground. Interview questions thus sought to elicit interviewees' daily practices, what elements of their work they described as most important, the least favorite aspects of their work,and their ideological orientation towards the concept of ‘care.’After obtaining consent, we recorded the interviews, which lasted between 45 and 90 minutes and took place mainly over Zoom. However, we did interview several caregivers and one coordinator in person. Team members iteratively refined these themes through discussion and mapped them to the EoW framework. We used a third-party qualitative coding tool (NVivo) to complete the coding process. To make theoretical sense of the data, we returned to the literature and iterated between data and extant research. Our findings indicate that technologists drew on several economies of worth—which we refer to as moral frameworks—to navigate the seemingly irreconcilable demands of home care. They referenced multiple interpretations of the term ‘care’ to resolve contradictions.We illustrate this point by first focusing on how technologists described the problems that they claim to solve. Then, we analyze the nature of the solutions they presented, highlighting how technolo-gists imbued different aspects of algorithm design and function with moral meanings. This finding demonstrates the interpretive flexibil-ity of technological artifacts. Finally, we turn to the perspectives of caregivers and coordinators. Their accounts show how algorithmic staffing practices created new forms of uncertainty—the mirror of technologists' stated intentions.4.1 Navigating Contextual ComplexityTechnologists drew on multiple moral frameworks to navigate expectations and demands, appealing to various interpretations of care’ to reconcile the contradictory pressures they face. The technologists we interviewed framed CareTech as a platform developed to address traditional home care agencies’ logistical and opera-tional challenges. In this context, they appealed to an industrial moral framework, framing their work as introducing greater levels of efficiency and rationalization to the home care industry. How-ever, many of the technologists we interviewed also framed their work in terms of a civic moral framework, critiquing prior staffing practices as subjective, opaque, unfair, and harmful to the material well-being of caregivers. Although these two narratives may appear contradictory, technologists unified these demands by appealing to the societal need for more care. For example, improvements inefficiency were discussed in terms of increasing the affordability of care while improving working conditions was imagined as growing the size of the caregiving workforce. We argue that technologists navigate complexity when creating and developing care algorithms by strategically appealing to justifications corresponding to differ-ent moral frameworks, drawing on multiple interpretations of a single term to move between them. Throughout this section, we draw attention to how technologists position algorithmic staffing practices as one solution to the problems they described.4.1.1 Platform Description & Motivations. The rhetoric that tech-nologists and company executives used to describe their motivation for building the platform appealed to domestic and social goods. In press releases and on the company website, CareTech’s execu-tives described their frustrations in searching for care for their own parents. Similarly, technologists invoked ideas of familial respon-sibility, relaying stories about their difficulties in finding care for aging parents. Technologists also drew on more civic-oriented no-tions of good, framing their work with reference to positive social change. For example, Richard described, “being part of something that can have a positive impact on society.” The company’s mission statement, was described as ‘improving care in society6, highlight-ing the significance of a single moral concept in technologists discourse.In discussing the company’s strategy, the technologists we in-terviewed described CareTech as a “platform,” “communication company,” or “logistical engine,”, foregrounding CareTech’s use of digital technology to improve efficiency, and framed their work asa response to logistical challenges in the home care industry. Aiden described what he framed as the company’s main value proposition:I think the big sort of sell is, it is getting harder and harder to operate care. I think it is getting more expensive...the core value proposition is where we are trying to figure out how to build a platform around doing this, and helping agencies focus more on their relationships with their communities and customers.He elaborated that, by centralizing operations, CareTech offers partner agencies relief from work that is “consuming and grueling,whether it’s paperwork, management, documentation, staffing, lo-gistics, or being on call all the time.” By filling this role, CareTech‘frees up agencies to both source customers and maintain that rela-tionship and kind of connection’ (Aiden). Repeated references to the relationship between CareTech and the agencies with which it partners serve two purposes. First, they identify areas whereCareTech uses technology to increase efficiency in the home care industry. This problem formulation provides the background for how organizational solutions are framed. Second, they format a division of labor. In this account, partner agencies are positioned as responsible for managing relationships in local markets, while the platform oversees aspects of labor control and management.Here, technologists frame the platform’s work in industrial terms and partner agencies in domestic terms. 4.1.2 Staffing Practices as Solutions. As they justified their work,technologists also blended elements from multiple moral frame-works. Specifically, they simultaneously appealed to notions of market dominance and civic responsibility. This overlap materialized as Robert, a data scientist, stated that the company’s scale offered a ‘unified view across markets’ and provided access to a sufficient amount of data to use statistical techniques to ‘learn from the data to provide better home care’, serving as a “competitive dif-ferentiator in the market.” In addition, Floyd framed the company's size as affording more ‘careful’ staffing practice:From a systemic perspective, when you are bigger you have these systems in place, and you do not have to guilt somebody into working a shift. If you need a shift filled, you have a stable of hundreds of caregivers you can reach out to, it is just a matter of how much bonus you have to put on it.These rhetorical strategies demonstrate how technologists draw on multiple moral frameworks to present their work as solutions to different problems.Building on discussions of CareTech’s organizational strategy,technologists most concretely articulated their efforts toward ‘im-proving care in society’ through labor management. They started these discussions by problematizing caregiver job quality under legacy home care practices as associated with low wages, few ben-efits, rigid scheduling practices, and little recognition of caregivers efforts. Kennedy critiqued legacy staffing practices on the grounds of fairness and transparency:There’s a lot of favoritism that happens. There’s a lack of transparency. And so as you can imagine, the caregivers who work the most shifts, they’re able to earn the most amount of money. And that’s really helping to improve their lives and livelihoods. Other technologists framed algorithmic staffing as a solution to the legacy staffing practices that Kennedy identified as opaque and unfair. While Kennedy incorporated concerns about material well-being into her critiques, other technologists generally avoided discussing their efforts toward increasing caregiver job quality in terms of a market-based moral framework. This may have resulted from the market constraints of care, where the price for private pay home care is inaccessible for many families. Aria explainedthat raising wages for caregivers would make the price of care“unpayable” by many clients. 4.1.3 Professionalizing Care. Instead, technologists framed their efforts as attempts to improve caregivers’ status and provide them with a career. Aria noted that improving the collective status of caregivers was part of CareTech’s mission since its founding, em-phasizing challenging aspects of the job:I think that a really big piece of what CareTech is try-ing to do and has been trying to do since the beginning you know, elevate the profession of caregiving. Andtruly treat it a profession instead of just a job...because it's a difficult, emotionally intense, sometimes physi-cally intense thing to do.Floyd described further aspirations to elevate caregivers’ status through professionalization:I would say that [career] is a north star for us. I think everyone views that as an innovation that we can and should make, and the profession is worth it... we're working towards it, but we haven’t actually gotten there yet.These discussions highlight the links that technologists establish between different moral frameworks as they respond to a complex set of challenges. While they expressed concern about the value that care holds in society, increasing the pecuniary value of car was viewed as infeasible. Technologists responded to this problem by appealing to the status of the profession. However, technologists most defined solutions came in the form of staffing algorithms.4.2 Datafying CareWe unpack staffing practices at CareTech, which we argue are emblematic of technological solutionism. Our analysis reveals that technologists associated different aspects of staffing algorithms with different moral frameworks. We argue that how decisions are made about who is best suited for particular shifts—and why—is changing with the advent and implementation of algorithmic staffing tools as technologists prioritize efficiency. However, discussions with technologists show that there are tensions present in the use of algorithms. On the one hand, technologists discussed their work in terms of trying to increase caregiver performance. Performance Evaluation metrics break care into a set of constituent elements closely aligned with operational efficiency (an appeal to the indus-trial moral framework). On the other hand, technologists described their work as oriented toward establishing long-term relationships between caregivers and care recipients (an appeal to the domestic moral framework).The metrics and measurements that support algorithmic staffing practices are most closely associated with notions of productivity and operational efficiency. Technologists presented one part of their work as oriented toward increasing the “performance, or perceived performance of the caregiver” (Floyd). They described how this work is accomplished by measuring: (1) timeliness (how frequently a caregiver arrives to a shift on time); (2) consistency (adherence to schedule shifts); (3) application usage (whether or not the caregiver uses the application to clock in to and out of shifts and evaluate care recipient well-being); and (4) call-offs (shifts not released seven days in advance). While this evaluation practice makes care legible based on a discrete set of metrics, the composition of these metrics is oriented toward operational efficiency rather than the experiences of care recipients or care coordinators.Technologists contrasted their work with platforms in the ride-hailing industry7, describing how their work was motivated by the desire to establish long-term relationships between caregivers and care recipients. They referenced algorithms in terms that framed care as a holistic practice, often comparing the product of their work to other intimate relationships. Staffing algorithms have a role at two main sites: as initial schedules were made and when other caregivers called off their shifts. When caregivers are scheduled during their onboarding, staff members at CareTech use algorithmic recommendation systems to match caregivers with care recipients.In both cases, platform architects compared the matching process to other intimate relations between caregivers and care recipients.In Sandra’s words: Once the data are all collected, [the algorithm] gives us a list of caregivers, and it was ranked by most likely to be picked up by the caregiver...there is a...I don't want to say negotiating, but there are conversations that go back and forth. Because it does become an arranged marriage when you’re putting it inside thehome.In instances where shifts opened up with clients, the platform gives caregivers the option to pick up shifts with these clients through a user interface that Floyd described as “not not tinder 8 inspired. In advancing these relationship-based arguments, technologists define quality care by referencing domestic relationships between caregivers and care recipients.On the one hand, technologists seek to build a platform that effi-ciently delivers consistent care to a growing number of older adult care recipients. On the other, they describe their work as motivated by a desire to optimize relationships between caregivers and care recipients. At the same time, they framed their efforts as improving fairness, accountability, and transparency in staffing practices. Pair-ing discussions of metrics—which break care down into constituent elements associated with industrial efficiency—with algorithms staffing practices—which technologists use to frame evaluation in domestic terms—reveals that these actors associate different parts of their job with distinct moral frameworks to meet a complex set of demands. Further, interviews with caregivers and coordinators reveal that these performance evaluation criteria and platform staffing practices are a source of tension and stress.4.3 Platform AsymmetriesWhat are the consequences of technologists’ actions? To answer this question, we turn to platform caregivers’ and care coordinators’ per-spectives and experiences. Contrary to technologists’ aspirations touse algorithms to build a fairer, more transparent order, algorithmic staffing practices in fact created new conditions of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. First, we focus on evaluation practices.CareTech’s app for caregivers displays ratings across several met-rics related to operational aspects of care delivery (i.e., timeliness,consistency, application usage, and call-offs). The platform also sends weekly caregiver evaluation surveys to coordinators but does not share this feedback directly with caregivers. Further, caregivers rarely received qualitative feedback regarding the quality of care they provided. Caregivers discussed how these aspects of platform design contributed to ambiguity regarding insight into their perfor-mance, while coordinators approached completing survey-based caregiver evaluations with ambivalence.

You know, so I’m going to own that part.” While some coordinators expressed frustration about consistency, communication, quality, and the efficacy of evaluation practices, they appealed to multiple moral frameworks to justify different uses of evaluation infrastructure.4.3.2 Work Practices and Professional Boundaries. Continued dis-cussion with caregivers provided insight into how the problems that technologists faced contributed to aspects of platform design.The need to fill open shifts and coordinate care work across multiple individuals—associated with an industrial moral framework—took precedence over other concerns. Francine’s account of interactions with CareTech provides an example of how the need to staff shifts devalued communication about performance: “they have never given me any feedback or evaluation, the only time they call is about the schedule, asking if you can work more.” We argue that technologists prioritization of needs associated with the industrial moral frame-work eroded the boundary between caregivers’ work and personal lives and changed care practices.For example, the platform uses a notification system to bring open shifts to caregivers’ attention. However, Pepper describe how the constant notification stream makes it difficult for her to differentiate between work and leisure time:I can tell they have a lot of shifts to fill in. Am I go-ing to be under pressure? They’ve asked me for five things, and you said no to all of them, it feels likeI should say yes to something now. It’s just a little harder to be either working or not working...when you see your phone in the morning and you see all those notifications there.Hayden described receiving “30 to 40” notifications a day from the app, even after reaching out to CareTech to express that they would not work any more shifts. Further, they described confu-sion and frustration regarding the processes by which shifts were initially assigned:I actually said no to [the shift], but they scheduled me anyway. Which was how I got a lot of my shifts,which was okay...I know sometimes it sounds weird,but I would say no to a shift, maybe they’d think thatI said yes.This account suggests that the platform does not allow for as much flexibility as technologists imagine.In contrast to legacy record-keeping procedures, where care-givers left paper-based care notes in clients’ homes, CareTech’splatform requires that caregivers describe their shifts upon clock-ing out in an electronic journal that is viewable by coordinators and other caregivers. While caregivers described that the journal helped them feel more prepared for each shift, they also described reading journal entries outside of working hours, which provided further evidence for blurred boundaries between work and personal life.For example, Chauncey described reading entries “at night, before Igo to bed, I start reading if I’m going to work the next morning.” In Addition, platform architecture requiring caregivers to complete these logs changed caregivers’ relationship to time spent on the job. Francine described how filling out the notes, especially in the time-sensitive context of a shift, placed pressure on how she spent time providing care: “if you clock out right at a minute after [your shift ends] they get you on that.” Efforts to avoid disciplinary action created new relationships to time: “I just always try to clock out a few minutes before because you get all these questions before closing out the app” (Francine). In these cases, platform architecture changed caregivers' relationships with their time both on and off the clock,which put caregivers under additional pressure.We found that aspects of platform and algorithm design create new forms of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. We argue that this results from a mismatch between technologists’ moral reasoning and that of other platform actors. In addition, the need to fill open shifts and coordinate work across many individuals pri-oritizes a logic of efficiency over concerns for caregiver job quality.Despite coordinators’ unmet expectations and new pressures that the platform placed on caregivers, both sets of actors maintain a commitment to the platform. A possible explanation for contin-ued attachment is the moral significance of ‘care.’ While the term carries various meanings across actors and situations, it may act as a resource that maintains a particular status quo by mitigating organized critique of or departure from the platform.

17,Staffing,Artifact,"The subject of our case study, CareTech4, is one of several start-upsthat are credited with “reinventing the [home care] agency model”[22]. Prior to data collection, CareTech acquired StayHome, a traditional home care agency franchise. To contextualize our findings,we briefly discuss CareTech’s business model.CareTech partners with traditional home care agencies to support back-end administrative, legal, compliance, and logistics functions in exchange for a share of partner agencies’ revenue, employing caregivers directly. Caregivers assist with activities of daily living(i.e., bathing, dressing, getting in or out of a bed or chair, walking,using the toilet, eating) [43], and instrumental activities of daily living (i.e., cooking, cleaning, transportation, laundry, managing finances) [46]. CareTech’s use of algorithms to match caregivers to care recipients is central to our case. When we started data collection, CareTech’s technology platform had recently been im-plemented at StayHome’s company-owned agencies, providing a unique opportunity to investigate care algorithm implementation.In this paper, we focus primarily on CareTech’s staffing prac-tices. CareTech uses metrics and algorithms, along with human management, to staff shifts. Staffing algorithms have a role at two main sites: as initial schedules were made and when other care-givers called off their shifts. When caregivers are scheduled during their onboarding, staff members at CareTech use algorithmic recommendation systems to match caregivers with care recipients. Evaluation metrics (i.e., timeliness, consistency, application usage,and call-offs), along with other data (e.g., caregiver commute time,number of complaints) are used to match caregivers and care recipients. Coordinators receive weekly surveys about the quality of care provided, and provide responses on a linear scale5. After IRB approval, we recruited participants—technologists (n =14), caregivers (n = 9), and coordinators (n = 7)—through a partnership with CareTech and StayHome for interviews using convenience and purposive sampling [10]. StayHome’s research staff arranged site visit and helped recruit participants. We provided a brief description of the study and a screening questionnaire distributed amongst the caregivers and coordinators over email. This approach provided an opportunity to learn from technologists, caregivers,coordinators who were enthusiastic about sharing their experi-ences with the platform. Table 2 and table 3 provide an overview of participant profiles.(1) Technologists: Technologists consisted of software engi-neers, designers, product managers, and data and opera-tions workers. Software engineers talked about buildingCareTech’s features and the company’s history. Designers Develop CareTech’s front-end user experience for caregivers.Designers, the operations team, and a product manager described how they approached curating the caregiver experi-ence. The data scientists, data analysts, and data stewards dis-cussed the metrics used to measure caregiver performance,the data that staffing algorithms use, and how algorithms work in practice.(2) Caregivers: We use the term ‘caregivers’ to refer to the people employed by CareTech to provide care for pay.(3) Coordinators: The term ‘coordinators’ refers to people that pay for CareTech’s services and coordinate their delivery,usually on behalf of an older loved one. Recruiting interview participants through a partnership with Stay-Home and CareTech potentially biased results toward more positive perspectives of organizational practices. Caregivers and coordina-tors with more negative views about the company may have been reluctant to share their opinions or participate in interviews alto-gether due to fears of retaliation from the platform. Convenience Sampling limited the extent to which we were able to understand differences across demographic subgroups. Future work should explore this issue. Further, recruitment overlooked the perspectives of care coordinators and caregivers who have left the platform due to difficulties This study draws on data gathered from one week of observations performed in July 2022 and 30 interviews conducted between May2022 and August 2022. We conducted in-depth interviews to understand the cultural inputs that shape algorithm design and the implications for caregivers and coordinators. Interviews are well-suited for understanding social dimensions of how people interpret the world and take actions based on those interpretations [64]. Interviews with technology workers show how they make sense of their work and build systems [67], and interviews with caregivers and coordinators show that care practices diverge from organizational philosophy [53]. After several interviews, one researcher visitedStayHome’s global headquarters and a company-owned agency,located in a major Midwestern city in the U.S. The researcher toured the company’s offices and met with support staff. In addition, theresearcher engaged these actors in informal conversations to learn how StayHome and CareTech operate. To understand how the plat-form is presented to caregivers and what aspects of paid care work are emphasized, the researcher observed a caregiver training ses-sion on lifting and transferring techniques at one of StayHome’scompany-owned franchises and attended a virtual onboarding ses-sion with CareTech in the afternoon.We developed the interview guide with interest in valuation and evaluation practices as they occur on CareTech’s platform. Treating valuation as a moral outlook, we drew on practice-oriented approaches to understanding how different actors conceptualize and contribute value in labor contexts [36]. Examining the practices of the people that develop platforms and those who are subject to their architecture provides an opportunity to identify the underlying justifications and actions that shape and transform care work as it occurs on the ground. Interview questions thus sought to elicit interviewees' daily practices, what elements of their work they described as most important, the least favorite aspects of their work,and their ideological orientation towards the concept of ‘care.’After obtaining consent, we recorded the interviews, which lasted between 45 and 90 minutes and took place mainly over Zoom. However, we did interview several caregivers and one coordinator in person. Team members iteratively refined these themes through discussion and mapped them to the EoW framework. We used a third-party qualitative coding tool (NVivo) to complete the coding process. To make theoretical sense of the data, we returned to the literature and iterated between data and extant research. Our findings indicate that technologists drew on several economies of worth—which we refer to as moral frameworks—to navigate the seemingly irreconcilable demands of home care. They referenced multiple interpretations of the term ‘care’ to resolve contradictions.We illustrate this point by first focusing on how technologists described the problems that they claim to solve. Then, we analyze the nature of the solutions they presented, highlighting how technolo-gists imbued different aspects of algorithm design and function with moral meanings. This finding demonstrates the interpretive flexibil-ity of technological artifacts. Finally, we turn to the perspectives of caregivers and coordinators. Their accounts show how algorithmic staffing practices created new forms of uncertainty—the mirror of technologists' stated intentions.4.1 Navigating Contextual ComplexityTechnologists drew on multiple moral frameworks to navigate expectations and demands, appealing to various interpretations of care’ to reconcile the contradictory pressures they face. The technologists we interviewed framed CareTech as a platform developed to address traditional home care agencies’ logistical and opera-tional challenges. In this context, they appealed to an industrial moral framework, framing their work as introducing greater levels of efficiency and rationalization to the home care industry. How-ever, many of the technologists we interviewed also framed their work in terms of a civic moral framework, critiquing prior staffing practices as subjective, opaque, unfair, and harmful to the material well-being of caregivers. Although these two narratives may appear contradictory, technologists unified these demands by appealing to the societal need for more care. For example, improvements inefficiency were discussed in terms of increasing the affordability of care while improving working conditions was imagined as growing the size of the caregiving workforce. We argue that technologists navigate complexity when creating and developing care algorithms by strategically appealing to justifications corresponding to differ-ent moral frameworks, drawing on multiple interpretations of a single term to move between them. Throughout this section, we draw attention to how technologists position algorithmic staffing practices as one solution to the problems they described.4.1.1 Platform Description & Motivations. The rhetoric that tech-nologists and company executives used to describe their motivation for building the platform appealed to domestic and social goods. In press releases and on the company website, CareTech’s execu-tives described their frustrations in searching for care for their own parents. Similarly, technologists invoked ideas of familial respon-sibility, relaying stories about their difficulties in finding care for aging parents. Technologists also drew on more civic-oriented no-tions of good, framing their work with reference to positive social change. For example, Richard described, “being part of something that can have a positive impact on society.” The company’s mission statement, was described as ‘improving care in society6, highlight-ing the significance of a single moral concept in technologists discourse.In discussing the company’s strategy, the technologists we in-terviewed described CareTech as a “platform,” “communication company,” or “logistical engine,”, foregrounding CareTech’s use of digital technology to improve efficiency, and framed their work asa response to logistical challenges in the home care industry. Aiden described what he framed as the company’s main value proposition:I think the big sort of sell is, it is getting harder and harder to operate care. I think it is getting more expensive...the core value proposition is where we are trying to figure out how to build a platform around doing this, and helping agencies focus more on their relationships with their communities and customers.He elaborated that, by centralizing operations, CareTech offers partner agencies relief from work that is “consuming and grueling,whether it’s paperwork, management, documentation, staffing, lo-gistics, or being on call all the time.” By filling this role, CareTech‘frees up agencies to both source customers and maintain that rela-tionship and kind of connection’ (Aiden). Repeated references to the relationship between CareTech and the agencies with which it partners serve two purposes. First, they identify areas whereCareTech uses technology to increase efficiency in the home care industry. This problem formulation provides the background for how organizational solutions are framed. Second, they format a division of labor. In this account, partner agencies are positioned as responsible for managing relationships in local markets, while the platform oversees aspects of labor control and management.Here, technologists frame the platform’s work in industrial terms and partner agencies in domestic terms. 4.1.2 Staffing Practices as Solutions. As they justified their work,technologists also blended elements from multiple moral frame-works. Specifically, they simultaneously appealed to notions of market dominance and civic responsibility. This overlap materialized as Robert, a data scientist, stated that the company’s scale offered a ‘unified view across markets’ and provided access to a sufficient amount of data to use statistical techniques to ‘learn from the data to provide better home care’, serving as a “competitive dif-ferentiator in the market.” In addition, Floyd framed the company's size as affording more ‘careful’ staffing practice:From a systemic perspective, when you are bigger you have these systems in place, and you do not have to guilt somebody into working a shift. If you need a shift filled, you have a stable of hundreds of caregivers you can reach out to, it is just a matter of how much bonus you have to put on it.These rhetorical strategies demonstrate how technologists draw on multiple moral frameworks to present their work as solutions to different problems.Building on discussions of CareTech’s organizational strategy,technologists most concretely articulated their efforts toward ‘im-proving care in society’ through labor management. They started these discussions by problematizing caregiver job quality under legacy home care practices as associated with low wages, few ben-efits, rigid scheduling practices, and little recognition of caregivers efforts. Kennedy critiqued legacy staffing practices on the grounds of fairness and transparency:There’s a lot of favoritism that happens. There’s a lack of transparency. And so as you can imagine, the caregivers who work the most shifts, they’re able to earn the most amount of money. And that’s really helping to improve their lives and livelihoods. Other technologists framed algorithmic staffing as a solution to the legacy staffing practices that Kennedy identified as opaque and unfair. While Kennedy incorporated concerns about material well-being into her critiques, other technologists generally avoided discussing their efforts toward increasing caregiver job quality in terms of a market-based moral framework. This may have resulted from the market constraints of care, where the price for private pay home care is inaccessible for many families. Aria explainedthat raising wages for caregivers would make the price of care“unpayable” by many clients. 4.1.3 Professionalizing Care. Instead, technologists framed their efforts as attempts to improve caregivers’ status and provide them with a career. Aria noted that improving the collective status of caregivers was part of CareTech’s mission since its founding, em-phasizing challenging aspects of the job:I think that a really big piece of what CareTech is try-ing to do and has been trying to do since the beginning you know, elevate the profession of caregiving. Andtruly treat it a profession instead of just a job...because it's a difficult, emotionally intense, sometimes physi-cally intense thing to do.Floyd described further aspirations to elevate caregivers’ status through professionalization:I would say that [career] is a north star for us. I think everyone views that as an innovation that we can and should make, and the profession is worth it... we're working towards it, but we haven’t actually gotten there yet.These discussions highlight the links that technologists establish between different moral frameworks as they respond to a complex set of challenges. While they expressed concern about the value that care holds in society, increasing the pecuniary value of car was viewed as infeasible. Technologists responded to this problem by appealing to the status of the profession. However, technologists most defined solutions came in the form of staffing algorithms.4.2 Datafying CareWe unpack staffing practices at CareTech, which we argue are emblematic of technological solutionism. Our analysis reveals that technologists associated different aspects of staffing algorithms with different moral frameworks. We argue that how decisions are made about who is best suited for particular shifts—and why—is changing with the advent and implementation of algorithmic staffing tools as technologists prioritize efficiency. However, discussions with technologists show that there are tensions present in the use of algorithms. On the one hand, technologists discussed their work in terms of trying to increase caregiver performance. Performance Evaluation metrics break care into a set of constituent elements closely aligned with operational efficiency (an appeal to the indus-trial moral framework). On the other hand, technologists described their work as oriented toward establishing long-term relationships between caregivers and care recipients (an appeal to the domestic moral framework).The metrics and measurements that support algorithmic staffing practices are most closely associated with notions of productivity and operational efficiency. Technologists presented one part of their work as oriented toward increasing the “performance, or perceived performance of the caregiver” (Floyd). They described how this work is accomplished by measuring: (1) timeliness (how frequently a caregiver arrives to a shift on time); (2) consistency (adherence to schedule shifts); (3) application usage (whether or not the caregiver uses the application to clock in to and out of shifts and evaluate care recipient well-being); and (4) call-offs (shifts not released seven days in advance). While this evaluation practice makes care legible based on a discrete set of metrics, the composition of these metrics is oriented toward operational efficiency rather than the experiences of care recipients or care coordinators.Technologists contrasted their work with platforms in the ride-hailing industry7, describing how their work was motivated by the desire to establish long-term relationships between caregivers and care recipients. They referenced algorithms in terms that framed care as a holistic practice, often comparing the product of their work to other intimate relationships. Staffing algorithms have a role at two main sites: as initial schedules were made and when other caregivers called off their shifts. When caregivers are scheduled during their onboarding, staff members at CareTech use algorithmic recommendation systems to match caregivers with care recipients.In both cases, platform architects compared the matching process to other intimate relations between caregivers and care recipients.In Sandra’s words: Once the data are all collected, [the algorithm] gives us a list of caregivers, and it was ranked by most likely to be picked up by the caregiver...there is a...I don't want to say negotiating, but there are conversations that go back and forth. Because it does become an arranged marriage when you’re putting it inside thehome.In instances where shifts opened up with clients, the platform gives caregivers the option to pick up shifts with these clients through a user interface that Floyd described as “not not tinder 8 inspired. In advancing these relationship-based arguments, technologists define quality care by referencing domestic relationships between caregivers and care recipients.On the one hand, technologists seek to build a platform that effi-ciently delivers consistent care to a growing number of older adult care recipients. On the other, they describe their work as motivated by a desire to optimize relationships between caregivers and care recipients. At the same time, they framed their efforts as improving fairness, accountability, and transparency in staffing practices. Pair-ing discussions of metrics—which break care down into constituent elements associated with industrial efficiency—with algorithms staffing practices—which technologists use to frame evaluation in domestic terms—reveals that these actors associate different parts of their job with distinct moral frameworks to meet a complex set of demands. Further, interviews with caregivers and coordinators reveal that these performance evaluation criteria and platform staffing practices are a source of tension and stress.4.3 Platform AsymmetriesWhat are the consequences of technologists’ actions? To answer this question, we turn to platform caregivers’ and care coordinators’ per-spectives and experiences. Contrary to technologists’ aspirations touse algorithms to build a fairer, more transparent order, algorithmic staffing practices in fact created new conditions of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. First, we focus on evaluation practices.CareTech’s app for caregivers displays ratings across several met-rics related to operational aspects of care delivery (i.e., timeliness,consistency, application usage, and call-offs). The platform also sends weekly caregiver evaluation surveys to coordinators but does not share this feedback directly with caregivers. Further, caregivers rarely received qualitative feedback regarding the quality of care they provided. Caregivers discussed how these aspects of platform design contributed to ambiguity regarding insight into their perfor-mance, while coordinators approached completing survey-based caregiver evaluations with ambivalence. Second, we analyze care-givers’ interactions with CareTech’s staffing practices. Caregivers described experiencing collapsed boundaries between working and personal time. Despite these new challenges, the caregivers and coordinators we interviewed did not mention a desire to leave. .4.3.1 Ambiguity and Ambivalence. While caregivers described providing care as meaningful and were generally content with the conditions they faced on the platform, they discussed a lack of clarity regarding expectations and performance. As Hayden said:I believe that the clients, they also rate us after every shift. So then if we get rated lowly every time or pretty consistently, I’m sure they will reach out tous...I don’t know that it helps us rate our care and how well we’re doing with our clients, but I don't know how else they could do that...you hear stories of people who are dissatisfied with their care, and that's hard to tell.It was only after connecting with other caregivers that Hayden Learned that it was possible to request a performance evaluation form CareTech. Further, the opacity of metrics created feelings of worry for care-givers about their performance. As a new caregiver on the platform,Hazel worried about a low client consistency rating and discussed needing to take the initiative to understand why she received low ratings across other metrics. Puzzled about low application usage ratings, Hazel described needing to reach out to CareTech to understand “what [she] was missing.” CareTech’s communication and evaluation practices created unclear situations with multiple interpretations and required additional labor on the part of caregivers to understand how care recipients experienced their care and how the platform judged their performance. Coordinators, on the other hand, discussed their own evaluation practices as infused with ambivalence—a finding that we found surprising given the intimate and impactful context of care for an older loved one. While coordinators described clear feelings about the care provided to loved ones, our interviewees responded to CareTech’s evaluation surveys inconsistently. Coordinators expressed satisfaction with the care that caregivers provided and thus did not feel a need to fill out the company’s weekly care-giver evaluation survey, described how these surveys were not as useful compared to in-person evaluations performed over more extended periods, or expressed that they did not feel their feedback through these outlets was listened to by CareTech. Phyllis—who lives with her care recipient—described that since the quality of care was so consistent, there was not a need to be very detailed in her evaluations: “they will send out those [surveys] weekly...soyou click on attentiveness, preparation, and I don’t remember what they all are. There’s about five of them. I don’t get very detailed.” On The other hand, Brooks—who did not live with his care recipient,and was dissatisfied with the consistency of staffing provided byCareTech—described feeling overwhelmed by the amount of eval-uating he was asked to do: “For each one of the caregivers that has been in, they’re asking for an opinion for eight to 10 caregivers everyMonday, on the same thing, the same people doing the same thing.I’ve had a hard time seeing the value on a weekly basis.” He saw more value in evaluations carried out over longer intervals as it had been before the acquisition. There used to be the quarterly report where they would actually go in and visit and come back and say,‘this has changed, or this looks like it’s changed’...when someone steps in four or five times a year those are the ones that can pick out some things.Opal, who uses CareTech to provide care to her husband, discussed her attitude towards the surveys: “Honestly, I ignore [the surveys]. It’s not something I want to do. I don’t know why. I know they're doing great.” These perspectives demonstrate a difference in the worth actors ascribed to particular evaluation practices, high-lighting a mismatch between technologists’, coordinators’, and care-givers’ perspectives. Other coordinators described non-use of CareTech’s evaluation infrastructure, even when there were striking departures from care expectations. Coordinators justified their approach by appealing to different moral frameworks. Riley said, “what did happen onetime, and I should probably be more tuned into it...there was one day when one of the caregivers didn’t show up at all. And I didn't know about it until the next day.” She justified the non-use through appeals to a domestic moral framework: “I’m not as hands-on, I’mnot looking at the app to see what they’re doing. I get my feedback on how they’re doing from my mom and dad.” Winnie, who relied on a caregiver to transport her mother to church on Sunday mornings, described situations where sometimes a caregiver assigned to the shift couldn’t drive or had no car. Even so, she did not fill out regular surveys, drawing on her experience as a business owner (industrial)to express that she understood the challenges of staffing shifts: “it’sa very hard thing to maneuver in the world that we’re walking in. We Own a small business. We employ 13 ladies, so I understand.” At the same time, she seemed to negatively moralize non-use: “I will be honest with you that a survey has come...I haven’t filled it out. So I Haven't done due diligence on my part. You know, so I’m going to own that part.” While some coordinators expressed frustration about consistency, communication, quality, and the efficacy of evaluation practices, they appealed to multiple moral frameworks to justify different uses of evaluation infrastructure.4.3.2 Work Practices and Professional Boundaries. Continued dis-cussion with caregivers provided insight into how the problems that technologists faced contributed to aspects of platform design.The need to fill open shifts and coordinate care work across multiple individuals—associated with an industrial moral framework—took precedence over other concerns. Francine’s account of interactions with CareTech provides an example of how the need to staff shifts devalued communication about performance: “they have never given me any feedback or evaluation, the only time they call is about the schedule, asking if you can work more.” We argue that technologists prioritization of needs associated with the industrial moral frame-work eroded the boundary between caregivers’ work and personal lives and changed care practices.For example, the platform uses a notification system to bring open shifts to caregivers’ attention. However, Pepper describe how the constant notification stream makes it difficult for her to differentiate between work and leisure time:I can tell they have a lot of shifts to fill in. Am I go-ing to be under pressure? They’ve asked me for five things, and you said no to all of them, it feels likeI should say yes to something now. It’s just a little harder to be either working or not working...when you see your phone in the morning and you see all those notifications there.Hayden described receiving “30 to 40” notifications a day from the app, even after reaching out to CareTech to express that they would not work any more shifts. Further, they described confu-sion and frustration regarding the processes by which shifts were initially assigned:I actually said no to [the shift], but they scheduled me anyway. Which was how I got a lot of my shifts,which was okay...I know sometimes it sounds weird,but I would say no to a shift, maybe they’d think thatI said yes.This account suggests that the platform does not allow for as much flexibility as technologists imagine.In contrast to legacy record-keeping procedures, where care-givers left paper-based care notes in clients’ homes, CareTech’splatform requires that caregivers describe their shifts upon clock-ing out in an electronic journal that is viewable by coordinators and other caregivers. While caregivers described that the journal helped them feel more prepared for each shift, they also described reading journal entries outside of working hours, which provided further evidence for blurred boundaries between work and personal life.For example, Chauncey described reading entries “at night, before Igo to bed, I start reading if I’m going to work the next morning.” In Addition, platform architecture requiring caregivers to complete these logs changed caregivers’ relationship to time spent on the job. Francine described how filling out the notes, especially in the time-sensitive context of a shift, placed pressure on how she spent time providing care: “if you clock out right at a minute after [your shift ends] they get you on that.” Efforts to avoid disciplinary action created new relationships to time: “I just always try to clock out a few minutes before because you get all these questions before closing out the app” (Francine). In these cases, platform architecture changed caregivers' relationships with their time both on and off the clock,which put caregivers under additional pressure.We found that aspects of platform and algorithm design create new forms of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators.

To understand how the plat-form is presented to caregivers and what aspects of paid care work are emphasized, the researcher observed a caregiver training ses-sion on lifting and transferring techniques at one of StayHome’scompany-owned franchises and attended a virtual onboarding ses-sion with CareTech in the afternoon.We developed the interview guide with interest in valuation and evaluation practices as they occur on CareTech’s platform. Treating valuation as a moral outlook, we drew on practice-oriented approaches to understanding how different actors conceptualize and contribute value in labor contexts [36]. Examining the practices of the people that develop platforms and those who are subject to their architecture provides an opportunity to identify the underlying justifications and actions that shape and transform care work as it occurs on the ground. Interview questions thus sought to elicit interviewees' daily practices, what elements of their work they described as most important, the least favorite aspects of their work,and their ideological orientation towards the concept of ‘care.’After obtaining consent, we recorded the interviews, which lasted between 45 and 90 minutes and took place mainly over Zoom. However, we did interview several caregivers and one coordinator in person. Team members iteratively refined these themes through discussion and mapped them to the EoW framework. We used a third-party qualitative coding tool (NVivo) to complete the coding process. To make theoretical sense of the data, we returned to the literature and iterated between data and extant research. Our findings indicate that technologists drew on several economies of worth—which we refer to as moral frameworks—to navigate the seemingly irreconcilable demands of home care. They referenced multiple interpretations of the term ‘care’ to resolve contradictions.We illustrate this point by first focusing on how technologists described the problems that they claim to solve. Then, we analyze the nature of the solutions they presented, highlighting how technolo-gists imbued different aspects of algorithm design and function with moral meanings. This finding demonstrates the interpretive flexibil-ity of technological artifacts. Finally, we turn to the perspectives of caregivers and coordinators. Their accounts show how algorithmic staffing practices created new forms of uncertainty—the mirror of technologists' stated intentions.4.1 Navigating Contextual ComplexityTechnologists drew on multiple moral frameworks to navigate expectations and demands, appealing to various interpretations of care’ to reconcile the contradictory pressures they face. The technologists we interviewed framed CareTech as a platform developed to address traditional home care agencies’ logistical and opera-tional challenges. In this context, they appealed to an industrial moral framework, framing their work as introducing greater levels of efficiency and rationalization to the home care industry. How-ever, many of the technologists we interviewed also framed their work in terms of a civic moral framework, critiquing prior staffing practices as subjective, opaque, unfair, and harmful to the material well-being of caregivers. Although these two narratives may appear contradictory, technologists unified these demands by appealing to the societal need for more care. For example, improvements inefficiency were discussed in terms of increasing the affordability of care while improving working conditions was imagined as growing the size of the caregiving workforce. We argue that technologists navigate complexity when creating and developing care algorithms by strategically appealing to justifications corresponding to differ-ent moral frameworks, drawing on multiple interpretations of a single term to move between them. Throughout this section, we draw attention to how technologists position algorithmic staffing practices as one solution to the problems they described.4.1.1 Platform Description & Motivations. The rhetoric that tech-nologists and company executives used to describe their motivation for building the platform appealed to domestic and social goods. In press releases and on the company website, CareTech’s execu-tives described their frustrations in searching for care for their own parents. Similarly, technologists invoked ideas of familial respon-sibility, relaying stories about their difficulties in finding care for aging parents. Technologists also drew on more civic-oriented no-tions of good, framing their work with reference to positive social change. For example, Richard described, “being part of something that can have a positive impact on society.” The company’s mission statement, was described as ‘improving care in society6, highlight-ing the significance of a single moral concept in technologists discourse.In discussing the company’s strategy, the technologists we in-terviewed described CareTech as a “platform,” “communication company,” or “logistical engine,”, foregrounding CareTech’s use of digital technology to improve efficiency, and framed their work asa response to logistical challenges in the home care industry. Aiden described what he framed as the company’s main value proposition:I think the big sort of sell is, it is getting harder and harder to operate care. I think it is getting more expensive...the core value proposition is where we are trying to figure out how to build a platform around doing this, and helping agencies focus more on their relationships with their communities and customers.He elaborated that, by centralizing operations, CareTech offers partner agencies relief from work that is “consuming and grueling,whether it’s paperwork, management, documentation, staffing, lo-gistics, or being on call all the time.” By filling this role, CareTech‘frees up agencies to both source customers and maintain that rela-tionship and kind of connection’ (Aiden). Repeated references to the relationship between CareTech and the agencies with which it partners serve two purposes. First, they identify areas whereCareTech uses technology to increase efficiency in the home care industry. This problem formulation provides the background for how organizational solutions are framed. Second, they format a division of labor. In this account, partner agencies are positioned as responsible for managing relationships in local markets, while the platform oversees aspects of labor control and management.Here, technologists frame the platform’s work in industrial terms and partner agencies in domestic terms. 4.1.2 Staffing Practices as Solutions. As they justified their work,technologists also blended elements from multiple moral frame-works. Specifically, they simultaneously appealed to notions of market dominance and civic responsibility. This overlap materialized as Robert, a data scientist, stated that the company’s scale offered a ‘unified view across markets’ and provided access to a sufficient amount of data to use statistical techniques to ‘learn from the data to provide better home care’, serving as a “competitive dif-ferentiator in the market.” In addition, Floyd framed the company's size as affording more ‘careful’ staffing practice:From a systemic perspective, when you are bigger you have these systems in place, and you do not have to guilt somebody into working a shift. If you need a shift filled, you have a stable of hundreds of caregivers you can reach out to, it is just a matter of how much bonus you have to put on it.These rhetorical strategies demonstrate how technologists draw on multiple moral frameworks to present their work as solutions to different problems.Building on discussions of CareTech’s organizational strategy,technologists most concretely articulated their efforts toward ‘im-proving care in society’ through labor management. They started these discussions by problematizing caregiver job quality under legacy home care practices as associated with low wages, few ben-efits, rigid scheduling practices, and little recognition of caregivers efforts. Kennedy critiqued legacy staffing practices on the grounds of fairness and transparency:There’s a lot of favoritism that happens. There’s a lack of transparency. And so as you can imagine, the caregivers who work the most shifts, they’re able to earn the most amount of money. And that’s really helping to improve their lives and livelihoods. Other technologists framed algorithmic staffing as a solution to the legacy staffing practices that Kennedy identified as opaque and unfair. While Kennedy incorporated concerns about material well-being into her critiques, other technologists generally avoided discussing their efforts toward increasing caregiver job quality in terms of a market-based moral framework. This may have resulted from the market constraints of care, where the price for private pay home care is inaccessible for many families. Aria explainedthat raising wages for caregivers would make the price of care“unpayable” by many clients. 4.1.3 Professionalizing Care. Instead, technologists framed their efforts as attempts to improve caregivers’ status and provide them with a career. Aria noted that improving the collective status of caregivers was part of CareTech’s mission since its founding, em-phasizing challenging aspects of the job:I think that a really big piece of what CareTech is try-ing to do and has been trying to do since the beginning you know, elevate the profession of caregiving. Andtruly treat it a profession instead of just a job...because it's a difficult, emotionally intense, sometimes physi-cally intense thing to do.Floyd described further aspirations to elevate caregivers’ status through professionalization:I would say that [career] is a north star for us. I think everyone views that as an innovation that we can and should make, and the profession is worth it... we're working towards it, but we haven’t actually gotten there yet.These discussions highlight the links that technologists establish between different moral frameworks as they respond to a complex set of challenges. While they expressed concern about the value that care holds in society, increasing the pecuniary value of car was viewed as infeasible. Technologists responded to this problem by appealing to the status of the profession. However, technologists most defined solutions came in the form of staffing algorithms.4.2 Datafying CareWe unpack staffing practices at CareTech, which we argue are emblematic of technological solutionism. Our analysis reveals that technologists associated different aspects of staffing algorithms with different moral frameworks. We argue that how decisions are made about who is best suited for particular shifts—and why—is changing with the advent and implementation of algorithmic staffing tools as technologists prioritize efficiency. However, discussions with technologists show that there are tensions present in the use of algorithms. On the one hand, technologists discussed their work in terms of trying to increase caregiver performance. Performance Evaluation metrics break care into a set of constituent elements closely aligned with operational efficiency (an appeal to the indus-trial moral framework). On the other hand, technologists described their work as oriented toward establishing long-term relationships between caregivers and care recipients (an appeal to the domestic moral framework).The metrics and measurements that support algorithmic staffing practices are most closely associated with notions of productivity and operational efficiency. Technologists presented one part of their work as oriented toward increasing the “performance, or perceived performance of the caregiver” (Floyd). They described how this work is accomplished by measuring: (1) timeliness (how frequently a caregiver arrives to a shift on time); (2) consistency (adherence to schedule shifts); (3) application usage (whether or not the caregiver uses the application to clock in to and out of shifts and evaluate care recipient well-being); and (4) call-offs (shifts not released seven days in advance). While this evaluation practice makes care legible based on a discrete set of metrics, the composition of these metrics is oriented toward operational efficiency rather than the experiences of care recipients or care coordinators.Technologists contrasted their work with platforms in the ride-hailing industry7, describing how their work was motivated by the desire to establish long-term relationships between caregivers and care recipients. They referenced algorithms in terms that framed care as a holistic practice, often comparing the product of their work to other intimate relationships. Staffing algorithms have a role at two main sites: as initial schedules were made and when other caregivers called off their shifts. When caregivers are scheduled during their onboarding, staff members at CareTech use algorithmic recommendation systems to match caregivers with care recipients.In both cases, platform architects compared the matching process to other intimate relations between caregivers and care recipients.In Sandra’s words: Once the data are all collected, [the algorithm] gives us a list of caregivers, and it was ranked by most likely to be picked up by the caregiver...there is a...I don't want to say negotiating, but there are conversations that go back and forth. Because it does become an arranged marriage when you’re putting it inside thehome.In instances where shifts opened up with clients, the platform gives caregivers the option to pick up shifts with these clients through a user interface that Floyd described as “not not tinder 8 inspired. In advancing these relationship-based arguments, technologists define quality care by referencing domestic relationships between caregivers and care recipients.On the one hand, technologists seek to build a platform that effi-ciently delivers consistent care to a growing number of older adult care recipients. On the other, they describe their work as motivated by a desire to optimize relationships between caregivers and care recipients. At the same time, they framed their efforts as improving fairness, accountability, and transparency in staffing practices. Pair-ing discussions of metrics—which break care down into constituent elements associated with industrial efficiency—with algorithms staffing practices—which technologists use to frame evaluation in domestic terms—reveals that these actors associate different parts of their job with distinct moral frameworks to meet a complex set of demands. Further, interviews with caregivers and coordinators reveal that these performance evaluation criteria and platform staffing practices are a source of tension and stress.4.3 Platform AsymmetriesWhat are the consequences of technologists’ actions? To answer this question, we turn to platform caregivers’ and care coordinators’ per-spectives and experiences. Contrary to technologists’ aspirations touse algorithms to build a fairer, more transparent order, algorithmic staffing practices in fact created new conditions of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. First, we focus on evaluation practices.CareTech’s app for caregivers displays ratings across several met-rics related to operational aspects of care delivery (i.e., timeliness,consistency, application usage, and call-offs). The platform also sends weekly caregiver evaluation surveys to coordinators but does not share this feedback directly with caregivers. Further, caregivers rarely received qualitative feedback regarding the quality of care they provided. Caregivers discussed how these aspects of platform design contributed to ambiguity regarding insight into their perfor-mance, while coordinators approached completing survey-based caregiver evaluations with ambivalence. Second, we analyze care-givers’ interactions with CareTech’s staffing practices. Caregivers described experiencing collapsed boundaries between working and personal time. Despite these new challenges, the caregivers and coordinators we interviewed did not mention a desire to leave. .4.3.1 Ambiguity and Ambivalence. While caregivers described providing care as meaningful and were generally content with the conditions they faced on the platform, they discussed a lack of clarity regarding expectations and performance. As Hayden said:I believe that the clients, they also rate us after every shift. So then if we get rated lowly every time or pretty consistently, I’m sure they will reach out tous...I don’t know that it helps us rate our care and how well we’re doing with our clients, but I don't know how else they could do that...you hear stories of people who are dissatisfied with their care, and that's hard to tell.It was only after connecting with other caregivers that Hayden Learned that it was possible to request a performance evaluation form CareTech. Further, the opacity of metrics created feelings of worry for care-givers about their performance. As a new caregiver on the platform,Hazel worried about a low client consistency rating and discussed needing to take the initiative to understand why she received low ratings across other metrics. Puzzled about low application usage ratings, Hazel described needing to reach out to CareTech to understand “what [she] was missing.” CareTech’s communication and evaluation practices created unclear situations with multiple interpretations and required additional labor on the part of caregivers to understand how care recipients experienced their care and how the platform judged their performance. Coordinators, on the other hand, discussed their own evaluation practices as infused with ambivalence—a finding that we found surprising given the intimate and impactful context of care for an older loved one. While coordinators described clear feelings about the care provided to loved ones, our interviewees responded to CareTech’s evaluation surveys inconsistently. Coordinators expressed satisfaction with the care that caregivers provided and thus did not feel a need to fill out the company’s weekly care-giver evaluation survey, described how these surveys were not as useful compared to in-person evaluations performed over more extended periods, or expressed that they did not feel their feedback through these outlets was listened to by CareTech. Phyllis—who lives with her care recipient—described that since the quality of care was so consistent, there was not a need to be very detailed in her evaluations: “they will send out those [surveys] weekly...soyou click on attentiveness, preparation, and I don’t remember what they all are. There’s about five of them. I don’t get very detailed.” On The other hand, Brooks—who did not live with his care recipient,and was dissatisfied with the consistency of staffing provided byCareTech—described feeling overwhelmed by the amount of eval-uating he was asked to do: “For each one of the caregivers that has been in, they’re asking for an opinion for eight to 10 caregivers everyMonday, on the same thing, the same people doing the same thing.I’ve had a hard time seeing the value on a weekly basis.” He saw more value in evaluations carried out over longer intervals as it had been before the acquisition. There used to be the quarterly report where they would actually go in and visit and come back and say,‘this has changed, or this looks like it’s changed’...when someone steps in four or five times a year those are the ones that can pick out some things.Opal, who uses CareTech to provide care to her husband, discussed her attitude towards the surveys: “Honestly, I ignore [the surveys]. It’s not something I want to do. I don’t know why. I know they're doing great.” These perspectives demonstrate a difference in the worth actors ascribed to particular evaluation practices, high-lighting a mismatch between technologists’, coordinators’, and care-givers’ perspectives. Other coordinators described non-use of CareTech’s evaluation infrastructure, even when there were striking departures from care expectations. Coordinators justified their approach by appealing to different moral frameworks. Riley said, “what did happen onetime, and I should probably be more tuned into it...there was one day when one of the caregivers didn’t show up at all. And I didn't know about it until the next day.” She justified the non-use through appeals to a domestic moral framework: “I’m not as hands-on, I’mnot looking at the app to see what they’re doing. I get my feedback on how they’re doing from my mom and dad.” Winnie, who relied on a caregiver to transport her mother to church on Sunday mornings, described situations where sometimes a caregiver assigned to the shift couldn’t drive or had no car. Even so, she did not fill out regular surveys, drawing on her experience as a business owner (industrial)to express that she understood the challenges of staffing shifts: “it’sa very hard thing to maneuver in the world that we’re walking in. We Own a small business. We employ 13 ladies, so I understand.” At the same time, she seemed to negatively moralize non-use: “I will be honest with you that a survey has come...I haven’t filled it out. So I Haven't done due diligence on my part. You know, so I’m going to own that part.” While some coordinators expressed frustration about consistency, communication, quality, and the efficacy of evaluation practices, they appealed to multiple moral frameworks to justify different uses of evaluation infrastructure.4.3.2 Work Practices and Professional Boundaries. Continued dis-cussion with caregivers provided insight into how the problems that technologists faced contributed to aspects of platform design.The need to fill open shifts and coordinate care work across multiple individuals—associated with an industrial moral framework—took precedence over other concerns. Francine’s account of interactions with CareTech provides an example of how the need to staff shifts devalued communication about performance: “they have never given me any feedback or evaluation, the only time they call is about the schedule, asking if you can work more.” We argue that technologists prioritization of needs associated with the industrial moral frame-work eroded the boundary between caregivers’ work and personal lives and changed care practices.For example, the platform uses a notification system to bring open shifts to caregivers’ attention. However, Pepper describe how the constant notification stream makes it difficult for her to differentiate between work and leisure time:I can tell they have a lot of shifts to fill in. Am I go-ing to be under pressure? They’ve asked me for five things, and you said no to all of them, it feels likeI should say yes to something now. It’s just a little harder to be either working or not working...when you see your phone in the morning and you see all those notifications there.Hayden described receiving “30 to 40” notifications a day from the app, even after reaching out to CareTech to express that they would not work any more shifts. Further, they described confu-sion and frustration regarding the processes by which shifts were initially assigned:I actually said no to [the shift], but they scheduled me anyway. Which was how I got a lot of my shifts,which was okay...I know sometimes it sounds weird,but I would say no to a shift, maybe they’d think thatI said yes.This account suggests that the platform does not allow for as much flexibility as technologists imagine.In contrast to legacy record-keeping procedures, where care-givers left paper-based care notes in clients’ homes, CareTech’splatform requires that caregivers describe their shifts upon clock-ing out in an electronic journal that is viewable by coordinators and other caregivers. While caregivers described that the journal helped them feel more prepared for each shift, they also described reading journal entries outside of working hours, which provided further evidence for blurred boundaries between work and personal life.For example, Chauncey described reading entries “at night, before Igo to bed, I start reading if I’m going to work the next morning.” In Addition, platform architecture requiring caregivers to complete these logs changed caregivers’ relationship to time spent on the job. Francine described how filling out the notes, especially in the time-sensitive context of a shift, placed pressure on how she spent time providing care: “if you clock out right at a minute after [your shift ends] they get you on that.” Efforts to avoid disciplinary action created new relationships to time: “I just always try to clock out a few minutes before because you get all these questions before closing out the app” (Francine). In these cases, platform architecture changed caregivers' relationships with their time both on and off the clock,which put caregivers under additional pressure.We found that aspects of platform and algorithm design create new forms of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. We argue that this results from a mismatch between technologists’ moral reasoning and that of other platform actors. In addition, the need to fill open shifts and coordinate work across many individuals pri-oritizes a logic of efficiency over concerns for caregiver job quality.Despite coordinators’ unmet expectations and new pressures that the platform placed on caregivers, both sets of actors maintain a commitment to the platform. A possible explanation for contin-ued attachment is the moral significance of ‘care.’ While the term carries various meanings across actors and situations, it may act as a resource that maintains a particular status quo by mitigating organized critique of or departure from the platform.

19,ImproveCaregiverStatus,Goal,"The subject of our case study, CareTech4, is one of several start-upsthat are credited with “reinventing the [home care] agency model”[22]. Prior to data collection, CareTech acquired StayHome, a traditional home care agency franchise. To contextualize our findings,we briefly discuss CareTech’s business model.CareTech partners with traditional home care agencies to support back-end administrative, legal, compliance, and logistics functions in exchange for a share of partner agencies’ revenue, employing caregivers directly. Caregivers assist with activities of daily living(i.e., bathing, dressing, getting in or out of a bed or chair, walking,using the toilet, eating) [43], and instrumental activities of daily living (i.e., cooking, cleaning, transportation, laundry, managing finances) [46]. CareTech’s use of algorithms to match caregivers to care recipients is central to our case. When we started data collection, CareTech’s technology platform had recently been im-plemented at StayHome’s company-owned agencies, providing a unique opportunity to investigate care algorithm implementation.In this paper, we focus primarily on CareTech’s staffing prac-tices. CareTech uses metrics and algorithms, along with human management, to staff shifts. Staffing algorithms have a role at two main sites: as initial schedules were made and when other care-givers called off their shifts. When caregivers are scheduled during their onboarding, staff members at CareTech use algorithmic recommendation systems to match caregivers with care recipients. Evaluation metrics (i.e., timeliness, consistency, application usage,and call-offs), along with other data (e.g., caregiver commute time,number of complaints) are used to match caregivers and care recipients. Coordinators receive weekly surveys about the quality of care provided, and provide responses on a linear scale5. After IRB approval, we recruited participants—technologists (n =14), caregivers (n = 9), and coordinators (n = 7)—through a partnership with CareTech and StayHome for interviews using convenience and purposive sampling [10]. StayHome’s research staff arranged site visit and helped recruit participants. We provided a brief description of the study and a screening questionnaire distributed amongst the caregivers and coordinators over email. This approach provided an opportunity to learn from technologists, caregivers,coordinators who were enthusiastic about sharing their experi-ences with the platform. Table 2 and table 3 provide an overview of participant profiles.(1) Technologists: Technologists consisted of software engi-neers, designers, product managers, and data and opera-tions workers. Software engineers talked about buildingCareTech’s features and the company’s history. Designers Develop CareTech’s front-end user experience for caregivers.Designers, the operations team, and a product manager described how they approached curating the caregiver experi-ence. The data scientists, data analysts, and data stewards dis-cussed the metrics used to measure caregiver performance,the data that staffing algorithms use, and how algorithms work in practice.(2) Caregivers: We use the term ‘caregivers’ to refer to the people employed by CareTech to provide care for pay.(3) Coordinators: The term ‘coordinators’ refers to people that pay for CareTech’s services and coordinate their delivery,usually on behalf of an older loved one. Recruiting interview participants through a partnership with Stay-Home and CareTech potentially biased results toward more positive perspectives of organizational practices. Caregivers and coordina-tors with more negative views about the company may have been reluctant to share their opinions or participate in interviews alto-gether due to fears of retaliation from the platform. Convenience Sampling limited the extent to which we were able to understand differences across demographic subgroups. Future work should explore this issue. Further, recruitment overlooked the perspectives of care coordinators and caregivers who have left the platform due to difficulties This study draws on data gathered from one week of observations performed in July 2022 and 30 interviews conducted between May2022 and August 2022. We conducted in-depth interviews to understand the cultural inputs that shape algorithm design and the implications for caregivers and coordinators. Interviews are well-suited for understanding social dimensions of how people interpret the world and take actions based on those interpretations [64]. Interviews with technology workers show how they make sense of their work and build systems [67], and interviews with caregivers and coordinators show that care practices diverge from organizational philosophy [53]. After several interviews, one researcher visitedStayHome’s global headquarters and a company-owned agency,located in a major Midwestern city in the U.S. The researcher toured the company’s offices and met with support staff. In addition, theresearcher engaged these actors in informal conversations to learn how StayHome and CareTech operate.

I think everyone views that as an innovation that we can and should make, and the profession is worth it... we're working towards it, but we haven’t actually gotten there yet.These discussions highlight the links that technologists establish between different moral frameworks as they respond to a complex set of challenges. While they expressed concern about the value that care holds in society, increasing the pecuniary value of car was viewed as infeasible. Technologists responded to this problem by appealing to the status of the profession. However, technologists most defined solutions came in the form of staffing algorithms.4.2 Datafying CareWe unpack staffing practices at CareTech, which we argue are emblematic of technological solutionism. Our analysis reveals that technologists associated different aspects of staffing algorithms with different moral frameworks. We argue that how decisions are made about who is best suited for particular shifts—and why—is changing with the advent and implementation of algorithmic staffing tools as technologists prioritize efficiency. However, discussions with technologists show that there are tensions present in the use of algorithms. On the one hand, technologists discussed their work in terms of trying to increase caregiver performance. Performance Evaluation metrics break care into a set of constituent elements closely aligned with operational efficiency (an appeal to the indus-trial moral framework). On the other hand, technologists described their work as oriented toward establishing long-term relationships between caregivers and care recipients (an appeal to the domestic moral framework).The metrics and measurements that support algorithmic staffing practices are most closely associated with notions of productivity and operational efficiency. Technologists presented one part of their work as oriented toward increasing the “performance, or perceived performance of the caregiver” (Floyd). They described how this work is accomplished by measuring: (1) timeliness (how frequently a caregiver arrives to a shift on time); (2) consistency (adherence to schedule shifts); (3) application usage (whether or not the caregiver uses the application to clock in to and out of shifts and evaluate care recipient well-being); and (4) call-offs (shifts not released seven days in advance). While this evaluation practice makes care legible based on a discrete set of metrics, the composition of these metrics is oriented toward operational efficiency rather than the experiences of care recipients or care coordinators.Technologists contrasted their work with platforms in the ride-hailing industry7, describing how their work was motivated by the desire to establish long-term relationships between caregivers and care recipients. They referenced algorithms in terms that framed care as a holistic practice, often comparing the product of their work to other intimate relationships. Staffing algorithms have a role at two main sites: as initial schedules were made and when other caregivers called off their shifts. When caregivers are scheduled during their onboarding, staff members at CareTech use algorithmic recommendation systems to match caregivers with care recipients.In both cases, platform architects compared the matching process to other intimate relations between caregivers and care recipients.In Sandra’s words: Once the data are all collected, [the algorithm] gives us a list of caregivers, and it was ranked by most likely to be picked up by the caregiver...there is a...I don't want to say negotiating, but there are conversations that go back and forth. Because it does become an arranged marriage when you’re putting it inside thehome.In instances where shifts opened up with clients, the platform gives caregivers the option to pick up shifts with these clients through a user interface that Floyd described as “not not tinder 8 inspired. In advancing these relationship-based arguments, technologists define quality care by referencing domestic relationships between caregivers and care recipients.On the one hand, technologists seek to build a platform that effi-ciently delivers consistent care to a growing number of older adult care recipients. On the other, they describe their work as motivated by a desire to optimize relationships between caregivers and care recipients. At the same time, they framed their efforts as improving fairness, accountability, and transparency in staffing practices. Pair-ing discussions of metrics—which break care down into constituent elements associated with industrial efficiency—with algorithms staffing practices—which technologists use to frame evaluation in domestic terms—reveals that these actors associate different parts of their job with distinct moral frameworks to meet a complex set of demands. Further, interviews with caregivers and coordinators reveal that these performance evaluation criteria and platform staffing practices are a source of tension and stress.4.3 Platform AsymmetriesWhat are the consequences of technologists’ actions? To answer this question, we turn to platform caregivers’ and care coordinators’ per-spectives and experiences. Contrary to technologists’ aspirations touse algorithms to build a fairer, more transparent order, algorithmic staffing practices in fact created new conditions of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. First, we focus on evaluation practices.CareTech’s app for caregivers displays ratings across several met-rics related to operational aspects of care delivery (i.e., timeliness,consistency, application usage, and call-offs). The platform also sends weekly caregiver evaluation surveys to coordinators but does not share this feedback directly with caregivers. Further, caregivers rarely received qualitative feedback regarding the quality of care they provided. Caregivers discussed how these aspects of platform design contributed to ambiguity regarding insight into their perfor-mance, while coordinators approached completing survey-based caregiver evaluations with ambivalence. Second, we analyze care-givers’ interactions with CareTech’s staffing practices. Caregivers described experiencing collapsed boundaries between working and personal time. Despite these new challenges, the caregivers and coordinators we interviewed did not mention a desire to leave. .4.3.1 Ambiguity and Ambivalence. While caregivers described providing care as meaningful and were generally content with the conditions they faced on the platform, they discussed a lack of clarity regarding expectations and performance. As Hayden said:I believe that the clients, they also rate us after every shift. So then if we get rated lowly every time or pretty consistently, I’m sure they will reach out tous...I don’t know that it helps us rate our care and how well we’re doing with our clients, but I don't know how else they could do that...you hear stories of people who are dissatisfied with their care, and that's hard to tell.It was only after connecting with other caregivers that Hayden Learned that it was possible to request a performance evaluation form CareTech. Further, the opacity of metrics created feelings of worry for care-givers about their performance. As a new caregiver on the platform,Hazel worried about a low client consistency rating and discussed needing to take the initiative to understand why she received low ratings across other metrics. Puzzled about low application usage ratings, Hazel described needing to reach out to CareTech to understand “what [she] was missing.” CareTech’s communication and evaluation practices created unclear situations with multiple interpretations and required additional labor on the part of caregivers to understand how care recipients experienced their care and how the platform judged their performance. Coordinators, on the other hand, discussed their own evaluation practices as infused with ambivalence—a finding that we found surprising given the intimate and impactful context of care for an older loved one. While coordinators described clear feelings about the care provided to loved ones, our interviewees responded to CareTech’s evaluation surveys inconsistently. Coordinators expressed satisfaction with the care that caregivers provided and thus did not feel a need to fill out the company’s weekly care-giver evaluation survey, described how these surveys were not as useful compared to in-person evaluations performed over more extended periods, or expressed that they did not feel their feedback through these outlets was listened to by CareTech. Phyllis—who lives with her care recipient—described that since the quality of care was so consistent, there was not a need to be very detailed in her evaluations: “they will send out those [surveys] weekly...soyou click on attentiveness, preparation, and I don’t remember what they all are. There’s about five of them. I don’t get very detailed.” On The other hand, Brooks—who did not live with his care recipient,and was dissatisfied with the consistency of staffing provided byCareTech—described feeling overwhelmed by the amount of eval-uating he was asked to do: “For each one of the caregivers that has been in, they’re asking for an opinion for eight to 10 caregivers everyMonday, on the same thing, the same people doing the same thing.I’ve had a hard time seeing the value on a weekly basis.” He saw more value in evaluations carried out over longer intervals as it had been before the acquisition. There used to be the quarterly report where they would actually go in and visit and come back and say,‘this has changed, or this looks like it’s changed’...when someone steps in four or five times a year those are the ones that can pick out some things.Opal, who uses CareTech to provide care to her husband, discussed her attitude towards the surveys: “Honestly, I ignore [the surveys]. It’s not something I want to do. I don’t know why. I know they're doing great.” These perspectives demonstrate a difference in the worth actors ascribed to particular evaluation practices, high-lighting a mismatch between technologists’, coordinators’, and care-givers’ perspectives. Other coordinators described non-use of CareTech’s evaluation infrastructure, even when there were striking departures from care expectations. Coordinators justified their approach by appealing to different moral frameworks. Riley said, “what did happen onetime, and I should probably be more tuned into it...there was one day when one of the caregivers didn’t show up at all. And I didn't know about it until the next day.” She justified the non-use through appeals to a domestic moral framework: “I’m not as hands-on, I’mnot looking at the app to see what they’re doing. I get my feedback on how they’re doing from my mom and dad.” Winnie, who relied on a caregiver to transport her mother to church on Sunday mornings, described situations where sometimes a caregiver assigned to the shift couldn’t drive or had no car. Even so, she did not fill out regular surveys, drawing on her experience as a business owner (industrial)to express that she understood the challenges of staffing shifts: “it’sa very hard thing to maneuver in the world that we’re walking in. We Own a small business. We employ 13 ladies, so I understand.” At the same time, she seemed to negatively moralize non-use: “I will be honest with you that a survey has come...I haven’t filled it out. So I Haven't done due diligence on my part. You know, so I’m going to own that part.” While some coordinators expressed frustration about consistency, communication, quality, and the efficacy of evaluation practices, they appealed to multiple moral frameworks to justify different uses of evaluation infrastructure.4.3.2 Work Practices and Professional Boundaries. Continued dis-cussion with caregivers provided insight into how the problems that technologists faced contributed to aspects of platform design.The need to fill open shifts and coordinate care work across multiple individuals—associated with an industrial moral framework—took precedence over other concerns. Francine’s account of interactions with CareTech provides an example of how the need to staff shifts devalued communication about performance: “they have never given me any feedback or evaluation, the only time they call is about the schedule, asking if you can work more.” We argue that technologists prioritization of needs associated with the industrial moral frame-work eroded the boundary between caregivers’ work and personal lives and changed care practices.For example, the platform uses a notification system to bring open shifts to caregivers’ attention. However, Pepper describe how the constant notification stream makes it difficult for her to differentiate between work and leisure time:I can tell they have a lot of shifts to fill in. Am I go-ing to be under pressure? They’ve asked me for five things, and you said no to all of them, it feels likeI should say yes to something now. It’s just a little harder to be either working or not working...when you see your phone in the morning and you see all those notifications there.Hayden described receiving “30 to 40” notifications a day from the app, even after reaching out to CareTech to express that they would not work any more shifts. Further, they described confu-sion and frustration regarding the processes by which shifts were initially assigned:I actually said no to [the shift], but they scheduled me anyway. Which was how I got a lot of my shifts,which was okay...I know sometimes it sounds weird,but I would say no to a shift, maybe they’d think thatI said yes.This account suggests that the platform does not allow for as much flexibility as technologists imagine.In contrast to legacy record-keeping procedures, where care-givers left paper-based care notes in clients’ homes, CareTech’splatform requires that caregivers describe their shifts upon clock-ing out in an electronic journal that is viewable by coordinators and other caregivers. While caregivers described that the journal helped them feel more prepared for each shift, they also described reading journal entries outside of working hours, which provided further evidence for blurred boundaries between work and personal life.For example, Chauncey described reading entries “at night, before Igo to bed, I start reading if I’m going to work the next morning.” In Addition, platform architecture requiring caregivers to complete these logs changed caregivers’ relationship to time spent on the job. Francine described how filling out the notes, especially in the time-sensitive context of a shift, placed pressure on how she spent time providing care: “if you clock out right at a minute after [your shift ends] they get you on that.” Efforts to avoid disciplinary action created new relationships to time: “I just always try to clock out a few minutes before because you get all these questions before closing out the app” (Francine). In these cases, platform architecture changed caregivers' relationships with their time both on and off the clock,which put caregivers under additional pressure.We found that aspects of platform and algorithm design create new forms of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. We argue that this results from a mismatch between technologists’ moral reasoning and that of other platform actors. In addition, the need to fill open shifts and coordinate work across many individuals pri-oritizes a logic of efficiency over concerns for caregiver job quality.Despite coordinators’ unmet expectations and new pressures that the platform placed on caregivers, both sets of actors maintain a commitment to the platform. A possible explanation for contin-ued attachment is the moral significance of ‘care.’ While the term carries various meanings across actors and situations, it may act as a resource that maintains a particular status quo by mitigating organized critique of or departure from the platform.

20,TechnologicalSolutionism,Causal_Theory,"The subject of our case study, CareTech4, is one of several start-upsthat are credited with “reinventing the [home care] agency model”[22]. Prior to data collection, CareTech acquired StayHome, a traditional home care agency franchise. To contextualize our findings,we briefly discuss CareTech’s business model.CareTech partners with traditional home care agencies to support back-end administrative, legal, compliance, and logistics functions in exchange for a share of partner agencies’ revenue, employing caregivers directly. Caregivers assist with activities of daily living(i.e., bathing, dressing, getting in or out of a bed or chair, walking,using the toilet, eating) [43], and instrumental activities of daily living (i.e., cooking, cleaning, transportation, laundry, managing finances) [46]. CareTech’s use of algorithms to match caregivers to care recipients is central to our case. When we started data collection, CareTech’s technology platform had recently been im-plemented at StayHome’s company-owned agencies, providing a unique opportunity to investigate care algorithm implementation.In this paper, we focus primarily on CareTech’s staffing prac-tices. CareTech uses metrics and algorithms, along with human management, to staff shifts. Staffing algorithms have a role at two main sites: as initial schedules were made and when other care-givers called off their shifts. When caregivers are scheduled during their onboarding, staff members at CareTech use algorithmic recommendation systems to match caregivers with care recipients. Evaluation metrics (i.e., timeliness, consistency, application usage,and call-offs), along with other data (e.g., caregiver commute time,number of complaints) are used to match caregivers and care recipients. Coordinators receive weekly surveys about the quality of care provided, and provide responses on a linear scale5. After IRB approval, we recruited participants—technologists (n =14), caregivers (n = 9), and coordinators (n = 7)—through a partnership with CareTech and StayHome for interviews using convenience and purposive sampling [10]. StayHome’s research staff arranged site visit and helped recruit participants. We provided a brief description of the study and a screening questionnaire distributed amongst the caregivers and coordinators over email. This approach provided an opportunity to learn from technologists, caregivers,coordinators who were enthusiastic about sharing their experi-ences with the platform. Table 2 and table 3 provide an overview of participant profiles.(1) Technologists: Technologists consisted of software engi-neers, designers, product managers, and data and opera-tions workers. Software engineers talked about buildingCareTech’s features and the company’s history. Designers Develop CareTech’s front-end user experience for caregivers.Designers, the operations team, and a product manager described how they approached curating the caregiver experi-ence. The data scientists, data analysts, and data stewards dis-cussed the metrics used to measure caregiver performance,the data that staffing algorithms use, and how algorithms work in practice.(2) Caregivers: We use the term ‘caregivers’ to refer to the people employed by CareTech to provide care for pay.(3) Coordinators: The term ‘coordinators’ refers to people that pay for CareTech’s services and coordinate their delivery,usually on behalf of an older loved one. Recruiting interview participants through a partnership with Stay-Home and CareTech potentially biased results toward more positive perspectives of organizational practices. Caregivers and coordina-tors with more negative views about the company may have been reluctant to share their opinions or participate in interviews alto-gether due to fears of retaliation from the platform. Convenience Sampling limited the extent to which we were able to understand differences across demographic subgroups. Future work should explore this issue. Further, recruitment overlooked the perspectives of care coordinators and caregivers who have left the platform due to difficulties This study draws on data gathered from one week of observations performed in July 2022 and 30 interviews conducted between May2022 and August 2022. We conducted in-depth interviews to understand the cultural inputs that shape algorithm design and the implications for caregivers and coordinators. Interviews are well-suited for understanding social dimensions of how people interpret the world and take actions based on those interpretations [64]. Interviews with technology workers show how they make sense of their work and build systems [67], and interviews with caregivers and coordinators show that care practices diverge from organizational philosophy [53]. After several interviews, one researcher visitedStayHome’s global headquarters and a company-owned agency,located in a major Midwestern city in the U.S. The researcher toured the company’s offices and met with support staff. In addition, theresearcher engaged these actors in informal conversations to learn how StayHome and CareTech operate. To understand how the plat-form is presented to caregivers and what aspects of paid care work are emphasized, the researcher observed a caregiver training ses-sion on lifting and transferring techniques at one of StayHome’scompany-owned franchises and attended a virtual onboarding ses-sion with CareTech in the afternoon.We developed the interview guide with interest in valuation and evaluation practices as they occur on CareTech’s platform. Treating valuation as a moral outlook, we drew on practice-oriented approaches to understanding how different actors conceptualize and contribute value in labor contexts [36]. Examining the practices of the people that develop platforms and those who are subject to their architecture provides an opportunity to identify the underlying justifications and actions that shape and transform care work as it occurs on the ground. Interview questions thus sought to elicit interviewees' daily practices, what elements of their work they described as most important, the least favorite aspects of their work,and their ideological orientation towards the concept of ‘care.’After obtaining consent, we recorded the interviews, which lasted between 45 and 90 minutes and took place mainly over Zoom. However, we did interview several caregivers and one coordinator in person. Team members iteratively refined these themes through discussion and mapped them to the EoW framework. We used a third-party qualitative coding tool (NVivo) to complete the coding process. To make theoretical sense of the data, we returned to the literature and iterated between data and extant research. Our findings indicate that technologists drew on several economies of worth—which we refer to as moral frameworks—to navigate the seemingly irreconcilable demands of home care. They referenced multiple interpretations of the term ‘care’ to resolve contradictions.We illustrate this point by first focusing on how technologists described the problems that they claim to solve. Then, we analyze the nature of the solutions they presented, highlighting how technolo-gists imbued different aspects of algorithm design and function with moral meanings. This finding demonstrates the interpretive flexibil-ity of technological artifacts. Finally, we turn to the perspectives of caregivers and coordinators. Their accounts show how algorithmic staffing practices created new forms of uncertainty—the mirror of technologists' stated intentions.4.1 Navigating Contextual ComplexityTechnologists drew on multiple moral frameworks to navigate expectations and demands, appealing to various interpretations of care’ to reconcile the contradictory pressures they face. The technologists we interviewed framed CareTech as a platform developed to address traditional home care agencies’ logistical and opera-tional challenges. In this context, they appealed to an industrial moral framework, framing their work as introducing greater levels of efficiency and rationalization to the home care industry. How-ever, many of the technologists we interviewed also framed their work in terms of a civic moral framework, critiquing prior staffing practices as subjective, opaque, unfair, and harmful to the material well-being of caregivers. Although these two narratives may appear contradictory, technologists unified these demands by appealing to the societal need for more care. For example, improvements inefficiency were discussed in terms of increasing the affordability of care while improving working conditions was imagined as growing the size of the caregiving workforce. We argue that technologists navigate complexity when creating and developing care algorithms by strategically appealing to justifications corresponding to differ-ent moral frameworks, drawing on multiple interpretations of a single term to move between them. Throughout this section, we draw attention to how technologists position algorithmic staffing practices as one solution to the problems they described.4.1.1 Platform Description & Motivations. The rhetoric that tech-nologists and company executives used to describe their motivation for building the platform appealed to domestic and social goods. In press releases and on the company website, CareTech’s execu-tives described their frustrations in searching for care for their own parents. Similarly, technologists invoked ideas of familial respon-sibility, relaying stories about their difficulties in finding care for aging parents. Technologists also drew on more civic-oriented no-tions of good, framing their work with reference to positive social change. For example, Richard described, “being part of something that can have a positive impact on society.” The company’s mission statement, was described as ‘improving care in society6, highlight-ing the significance of a single moral concept in technologists discourse.In discussing the company’s strategy, the technologists we in-terviewed described CareTech as a “platform,” “communication company,” or “logistical engine,”, foregrounding CareTech’s use of digital technology to improve efficiency, and framed their work asa response to logistical challenges in the home care industry. Aiden described what he framed as the company’s main value proposition:I think the big sort of sell is, it is getting harder and harder to operate care. I think it is getting more expensive...the core value proposition is where we are trying to figure out how to build a platform around doing this, and helping agencies focus more on their relationships with their communities and customers.He elaborated that, by centralizing operations, CareTech offers partner agencies relief from work that is “consuming and grueling,whether it’s paperwork, management, documentation, staffing, lo-gistics, or being on call all the time.” By filling this role, CareTech‘frees up agencies to both source customers and maintain that rela-tionship and kind of connection’ (Aiden). Repeated references to the relationship between CareTech and the agencies with which it partners serve two purposes. First, they identify areas whereCareTech uses technology to increase efficiency in the home care industry. This problem formulation provides the background for how organizational solutions are framed. Second, they format a division of labor. In this account, partner agencies are positioned as responsible for managing relationships in local markets, while the platform oversees aspects of labor control and management.Here, technologists frame the platform’s work in industrial terms and partner agencies in domestic terms. 4.1.2 Staffing Practices as Solutions. As they justified their work,technologists also blended elements from multiple moral frame-works. Specifically, they simultaneously appealed to notions of market dominance and civic responsibility. This overlap materialized as Robert, a data scientist, stated that the company’s scale offered a ‘unified view across markets’ and provided access to a sufficient amount of data to use statistical techniques to ‘learn from the data to provide better home care’, serving as a “competitive dif-ferentiator in the market.” In addition, Floyd framed the company's size as affording more ‘careful’ staffing practice:From a systemic perspective, when you are bigger you have these systems in place, and you do not have to guilt somebody into working a shift. If you need a shift filled, you have a stable of hundreds of caregivers you can reach out to, it is just a matter of how much bonus you have to put on it.These rhetorical strategies demonstrate how technologists draw on multiple moral frameworks to present their work as solutions to different problems.Building on discussions of CareTech’s organizational strategy,technologists most concretely articulated their efforts toward ‘im-proving care in society’ through labor management. They started these discussions by problematizing caregiver job quality under legacy home care practices as associated with low wages, few ben-efits, rigid scheduling practices, and little recognition of caregivers efforts. Kennedy critiqued legacy staffing practices on the grounds of fairness and transparency:There’s a lot of favoritism that happens. There’s a lack of transparency. And so as you can imagine, the caregivers who work the most shifts, they’re able to earn the most amount of money. And that’s really helping to improve their lives and livelihoods. Other technologists framed algorithmic staffing as a solution to the legacy staffing practices that Kennedy identified as opaque and unfair. While Kennedy incorporated concerns about material well-being into her critiques, other technologists generally avoided discussing their efforts toward increasing caregiver job quality in terms of a market-based moral framework. This may have resulted from the market constraints of care, where the price for private pay home care is inaccessible for many families. Aria explainedthat raising wages for caregivers would make the price of care“unpayable” by many clients. 4.1.3 Professionalizing Care. Instead, technologists framed their efforts as attempts to improve caregivers’ status and provide them with a career. Aria noted that improving the collective status of caregivers was part of CareTech’s mission since its founding, em-phasizing challenging aspects of the job:I think that a really big piece of what CareTech is try-ing to do and has been trying to do since the beginning you know, elevate the profession of caregiving. Andtruly treat it a profession instead of just a job...because it's a difficult, emotionally intense, sometimes physi-cally intense thing to do.Floyd described further aspirations to elevate caregivers’ status through professionalization:I would say that [career] is a north star for us. I think everyone views that as an innovation that we can and should make, and the profession is worth it... we're working towards it, but we haven’t actually gotten there yet.These discussions highlight the links that technologists establish between different moral frameworks as they respond to a complex set of challenges. While they expressed concern about the value that care holds in society, increasing the pecuniary value of car was viewed as infeasible. Technologists responded to this problem by appealing to the status of the profession. However, technologists most defined solutions came in the form of staffing algorithms.4.2 Datafying CareWe unpack staffing practices at CareTech, which we argue are emblematic of technological solutionism.

To answer this question, we turn to platform caregivers’ and care coordinators’ per-spectives and experiences. Contrary to technologists’ aspirations touse algorithms to build a fairer, more transparent order, algorithmic staffing practices in fact created new conditions of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. First, we focus on evaluation practices.CareTech’s app for caregivers displays ratings across several met-rics related to operational aspects of care delivery (i.e., timeliness,consistency, application usage, and call-offs). The platform also sends weekly caregiver evaluation surveys to coordinators but does not share this feedback directly with caregivers.

There used to be the quarterly report where they would actually go in and visit and come back and say,‘this has changed, or this looks like it’s changed’...when someone steps in four or five times a year those are the ones that can pick out some things.Opal, who uses CareTech to provide care to her husband, discussed her attitude towards the surveys: “Honestly, I ignore [the surveys]. It’s not something I want to do. I don’t know why. I know they're doing great.” These perspectives demonstrate a difference in the worth actors ascribed to particular evaluation practices, high-lighting a mismatch between technologists’, coordinators’, and care-givers’ perspectives. Other coordinators described non-use of CareTech’s evaluation infrastructure, even when there were striking departures from care expectations. Coordinators justified their approach by appealing to different moral frameworks. Riley said, “what did happen onetime, and I should probably be more tuned into it...there was one day when one of the caregivers didn’t show up at all. And I didn't know about it until the next day.” She justified the non-use through appeals to a domestic moral framework: “I’m not as hands-on, I’mnot looking at the app to see what they’re doing. I get my feedback on how they’re doing from my mom and dad.” Winnie, who relied on a caregiver to transport her mother to church on Sunday mornings, described situations where sometimes a caregiver assigned to the shift couldn’t drive or had no car. Even so, she did not fill out regular surveys, drawing on her experience as a business owner (industrial)to express that she understood the challenges of staffing shifts: “it’sa very hard thing to maneuver in the world that we’re walking in. We Own a small business. We employ 13 ladies, so I understand.” At the same time, she seemed to negatively moralize non-use: “I will be honest with you that a survey has come...I haven’t filled it out. So I Haven't done due diligence on my part. You know, so I’m going to own that part.” While some coordinators expressed frustration about consistency, communication, quality, and the efficacy of evaluation practices, they appealed to multiple moral frameworks to justify different uses of evaluation infrastructure.4.3.2 Work Practices and Professional Boundaries. Continued dis-cussion with caregivers provided insight into how the problems that technologists faced contributed to aspects of platform design.The need to fill open shifts and coordinate care work across multiple individuals—associated with an industrial moral framework—took precedence over other concerns. Francine’s account of interactions with CareTech provides an example of how the need to staff shifts devalued communication about performance: “they have never given me any feedback or evaluation, the only time they call is about the schedule, asking if you can work more.” We argue that technologists prioritization of needs associated with the industrial moral frame-work eroded the boundary between caregivers’ work and personal lives and changed care practices.For example, the platform uses a notification system to bring open shifts to caregivers’ attention. However, Pepper describe how the constant notification stream makes it difficult for her to differentiate between work and leisure time:I can tell they have a lot of shifts to fill in. Am I go-ing to be under pressure? They’ve asked me for five things, and you said no to all of them, it feels likeI should say yes to something now. It’s just a little harder to be either working or not working...when you see your phone in the morning and you see all those notifications there.Hayden described receiving “30 to 40” notifications a day from the app, even after reaching out to CareTech to express that they would not work any more shifts. Further, they described confu-sion and frustration regarding the processes by which shifts were initially assigned:I actually said no to [the shift], but they scheduled me anyway. Which was how I got a lot of my shifts,which was okay...I know sometimes it sounds weird,but I would say no to a shift, maybe they’d think thatI said yes.This account suggests that the platform does not allow for as much flexibility as technologists imagine.In contrast to legacy record-keeping procedures, where care-givers left paper-based care notes in clients’ homes, CareTech’splatform requires that caregivers describe their shifts upon clock-ing out in an electronic journal that is viewable by coordinators and other caregivers. While caregivers described that the journal helped them feel more prepared for each shift, they also described reading journal entries outside of working hours, which provided further evidence for blurred boundaries between work and personal life.For example, Chauncey described reading entries “at night, before Igo to bed, I start reading if I’m going to work the next morning.” In Addition, platform architecture requiring caregivers to complete these logs changed caregivers’ relationship to time spent on the job. Francine described how filling out the notes, especially in the time-sensitive context of a shift, placed pressure on how she spent time providing care: “if you clock out right at a minute after [your shift ends] they get you on that.” Efforts to avoid disciplinary action created new relationships to time: “I just always try to clock out a few minutes before because you get all these questions before closing out the app” (Francine). In these cases, platform architecture changed caregivers' relationships with their time both on and off the clock,which put caregivers under additional pressure.We found that aspects of platform and algorithm design create new forms of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. We argue that this results from a mismatch between technologists’ moral reasoning and that of other platform actors. In addition, the need to fill open shifts and coordinate work across many individuals pri-oritizes a logic of efficiency over concerns for caregiver job quality.Despite coordinators’ unmet expectations and new pressures that the platform placed on caregivers, both sets of actors maintain a commitment to the platform. A possible explanation for contin-ued attachment is the moral significance of ‘care.’ While the term carries various meanings across actors and situations, it may act as a resource that maintains a particular status quo by mitigating organized critique of or departure from the platform.

21,IncreaseCareGiverPerformance,Goal,"The subject of our case study, CareTech4, is one of several start-upsthat are credited with “reinventing the [home care] agency model”[22]. Prior to data collection, CareTech acquired StayHome, a traditional home care agency franchise. To contextualize our findings,we briefly discuss CareTech’s business model.CareTech partners with traditional home care agencies to support back-end administrative, legal, compliance, and logistics functions in exchange for a share of partner agencies’ revenue, employing caregivers directly. Caregivers assist with activities of daily living(i.e., bathing, dressing, getting in or out of a bed or chair, walking,using the toilet, eating) [43], and instrumental activities of daily living (i.e., cooking, cleaning, transportation, laundry, managing finances) [46]. CareTech’s use of algorithms to match caregivers to care recipients is central to our case. When we started data collection, CareTech’s technology platform had recently been im-plemented at StayHome’s company-owned agencies, providing a unique opportunity to investigate care algorithm implementation.In this paper, we focus primarily on CareTech’s staffing prac-tices. CareTech uses metrics and algorithms, along with human management, to staff shifts. Staffing algorithms have a role at two main sites: as initial schedules were made and when other care-givers called off their shifts. When caregivers are scheduled during their onboarding, staff members at CareTech use algorithmic recommendation systems to match caregivers with care recipients. Evaluation metrics (i.e., timeliness, consistency, application usage,and call-offs), along with other data (e.g., caregiver commute time,number of complaints) are used to match caregivers and care recipients. Coordinators receive weekly surveys about the quality of care provided, and provide responses on a linear scale5. After IRB approval, we recruited participants—technologists (n =14), caregivers (n = 9), and coordinators (n = 7)—through a partnership with CareTech and StayHome for interviews using convenience and purposive sampling [10]. StayHome’s research staff arranged site visit and helped recruit participants. We provided a brief description of the study and a screening questionnaire distributed amongst the caregivers and coordinators over email. This approach provided an opportunity to learn from technologists, caregivers,coordinators who were enthusiastic about sharing their experi-ences with the platform. Table 2 and table 3 provide an overview of participant profiles.(1) Technologists: Technologists consisted of software engi-neers, designers, product managers, and data and opera-tions workers. Software engineers talked about buildingCareTech’s features and the company’s history. Designers Develop CareTech’s front-end user experience for caregivers.Designers, the operations team, and a product manager described how they approached curating the caregiver experi-ence. The data scientists, data analysts, and data stewards dis-cussed the metrics used to measure caregiver performance,the data that staffing algorithms use, and how algorithms work in practice.(2) Caregivers: We use the term ‘caregivers’ to refer to the people employed by CareTech to provide care for pay.(3) Coordinators: The term ‘coordinators’ refers to people that pay for CareTech’s services and coordinate their delivery,usually on behalf of an older loved one. Recruiting interview participants through a partnership with Stay-Home and CareTech potentially biased results toward more positive perspectives of organizational practices. Caregivers and coordina-tors with more negative views about the company may have been reluctant to share their opinions or participate in interviews alto-gether due to fears of retaliation from the platform. Convenience Sampling limited the extent to which we were able to understand differences across demographic subgroups. Future work should explore this issue. Further, recruitment overlooked the perspectives of care coordinators and caregivers who have left the platform due to difficulties This study draws on data gathered from one week of observations performed in July 2022 and 30 interviews conducted between May2022 and August 2022. We conducted in-depth interviews to understand the cultural inputs that shape algorithm design and the implications for caregivers and coordinators. Interviews are well-suited for understanding social dimensions of how people interpret the world and take actions based on those interpretations [64]. Interviews with technology workers show how they make sense of their work and build systems [67], and interviews with caregivers and coordinators show that care practices diverge from organizational philosophy [53]. After several interviews, one researcher visitedStayHome’s global headquarters and a company-owned agency,located in a major Midwestern city in the U.S. The researcher toured the company’s offices and met with support staff. In addition, theresearcher engaged these actors in informal conversations to learn how StayHome and CareTech operate. To understand how the plat-form is presented to caregivers and what aspects of paid care work are emphasized, the researcher observed a caregiver training ses-sion on lifting and transferring techniques at one of StayHome’scompany-owned franchises and attended a virtual onboarding ses-sion with CareTech in the afternoon.We developed the interview guide with interest in valuation and evaluation practices as they occur on CareTech’s platform. Treating valuation as a moral outlook, we drew on practice-oriented approaches to understanding how different actors conceptualize and contribute value in labor contexts [36]. Examining the practices of the people that develop platforms and those who are subject to their architecture provides an opportunity to identify the underlying justifications and actions that shape and transform care work as it occurs on the ground. Interview questions thus sought to elicit interviewees' daily practices, what elements of their work they described as most important, the least favorite aspects of their work,and their ideological orientation towards the concept of ‘care.’After obtaining consent, we recorded the interviews, which lasted between 45 and 90 minutes and took place mainly over Zoom. However, we did interview several caregivers and one coordinator in person. Team members iteratively refined these themes through discussion and mapped them to the EoW framework. We used a third-party qualitative coding tool (NVivo) to complete the coding process. To make theoretical sense of the data, we returned to the literature and iterated between data and extant research. Our findings indicate that technologists drew on several economies of worth—which we refer to as moral frameworks—to navigate the seemingly irreconcilable demands of home care. They referenced multiple interpretations of the term ‘care’ to resolve contradictions.We illustrate this point by first focusing on how technologists described the problems that they claim to solve. Then, we analyze the nature of the solutions they presented, highlighting how technolo-gists imbued different aspects of algorithm design and function with moral meanings. This finding demonstrates the interpretive flexibil-ity of technological artifacts. Finally, we turn to the perspectives of caregivers and coordinators. Their accounts show how algorithmic staffing practices created new forms of uncertainty—the mirror of technologists' stated intentions.4.1 Navigating Contextual ComplexityTechnologists drew on multiple moral frameworks to navigate expectations and demands, appealing to various interpretations of care’ to reconcile the contradictory pressures they face. The technologists we interviewed framed CareTech as a platform developed to address traditional home care agencies’ logistical and opera-tional challenges. In this context, they appealed to an industrial moral framework, framing their work as introducing greater levels of efficiency and rationalization to the home care industry. How-ever, many of the technologists we interviewed also framed their work in terms of a civic moral framework, critiquing prior staffing practices as subjective, opaque, unfair, and harmful to the material well-being of caregivers. Although these two narratives may appear contradictory, technologists unified these demands by appealing to the societal need for more care. For example, improvements inefficiency were discussed in terms of increasing the affordability of care while improving working conditions was imagined as growing the size of the caregiving workforce. We argue that technologists navigate complexity when creating and developing care algorithms by strategically appealing to justifications corresponding to differ-ent moral frameworks, drawing on multiple interpretations of a single term to move between them. Throughout this section, we draw attention to how technologists position algorithmic staffing practices as one solution to the problems they described.4.1.1 Platform Description & Motivations. The rhetoric that tech-nologists and company executives used to describe their motivation for building the platform appealed to domestic and social goods. In press releases and on the company website, CareTech’s execu-tives described their frustrations in searching for care for their own parents. Similarly, technologists invoked ideas of familial respon-sibility, relaying stories about their difficulties in finding care for aging parents. Technologists also drew on more civic-oriented no-tions of good, framing their work with reference to positive social change. For example, Richard described, “being part of something that can have a positive impact on society.” The company’s mission statement, was described as ‘improving care in society6, highlight-ing the significance of a single moral concept in technologists discourse.In discussing the company’s strategy, the technologists we in-terviewed described CareTech as a “platform,” “communication company,” or “logistical engine,”, foregrounding CareTech’s use of digital technology to improve efficiency, and framed their work asa response to logistical challenges in the home care industry. Aiden described what he framed as the company’s main value proposition:I think the big sort of sell is, it is getting harder and harder to operate care. I think it is getting more expensive...the core value proposition is where we are trying to figure out how to build a platform around doing this, and helping agencies focus more on their relationships with their communities and customers.He elaborated that, by centralizing operations, CareTech offers partner agencies relief from work that is “consuming and grueling,whether it’s paperwork, management, documentation, staffing, lo-gistics, or being on call all the time.” By filling this role, CareTech‘frees up agencies to both source customers and maintain that rela-tionship and kind of connection’ (Aiden). Repeated references to the relationship between CareTech and the agencies with which it partners serve two purposes. First, they identify areas whereCareTech uses technology to increase efficiency in the home care industry. This problem formulation provides the background for how organizational solutions are framed. Second, they format a division of labor. In this account, partner agencies are positioned as responsible for managing relationships in local markets, while the platform oversees aspects of labor control and management.Here, technologists frame the platform’s work in industrial terms and partner agencies in domestic terms. 4.1.2 Staffing Practices as Solutions. As they justified their work,technologists also blended elements from multiple moral frame-works. Specifically, they simultaneously appealed to notions of market dominance and civic responsibility. This overlap materialized as Robert, a data scientist, stated that the company’s scale offered a ‘unified view across markets’ and provided access to a sufficient amount of data to use statistical techniques to ‘learn from the data to provide better home care’, serving as a “competitive dif-ferentiator in the market.” In addition, Floyd framed the company's size as affording more ‘careful’ staffing practice:From a systemic perspective, when you are bigger you have these systems in place, and you do not have to guilt somebody into working a shift. If you need a shift filled, you have a stable of hundreds of caregivers you can reach out to, it is just a matter of how much bonus you have to put on it.These rhetorical strategies demonstrate how technologists draw on multiple moral frameworks to present their work as solutions to different problems.Building on discussions of CareTech’s organizational strategy,technologists most concretely articulated their efforts toward ‘im-proving care in society’ through labor management. They started these discussions by problematizing caregiver job quality under legacy home care practices as associated with low wages, few ben-efits, rigid scheduling practices, and little recognition of caregivers efforts. Kennedy critiqued legacy staffing practices on the grounds of fairness and transparency:There’s a lot of favoritism that happens. There’s a lack of transparency. And so as you can imagine, the caregivers who work the most shifts, they’re able to earn the most amount of money. And that’s really helping to improve their lives and livelihoods. Other technologists framed algorithmic staffing as a solution to the legacy staffing practices that Kennedy identified as opaque and unfair. While Kennedy incorporated concerns about material well-being into her critiques, other technologists generally avoided discussing their efforts toward increasing caregiver job quality in terms of a market-based moral framework. This may have resulted from the market constraints of care, where the price for private pay home care is inaccessible for many families. Aria explainedthat raising wages for caregivers would make the price of care“unpayable” by many clients. 4.1.3 Professionalizing Care. Instead, technologists framed their efforts as attempts to improve caregivers’ status and provide them with a career. Aria noted that improving the collective status of caregivers was part of CareTech’s mission since its founding, em-phasizing challenging aspects of the job:I think that a really big piece of what CareTech is try-ing to do and has been trying to do since the beginning you know, elevate the profession of caregiving. Andtruly treat it a profession instead of just a job...because it's a difficult, emotionally intense, sometimes physi-cally intense thing to do.Floyd described further aspirations to elevate caregivers’ status through professionalization:I would say that [career] is a north star for us. I think everyone views that as an innovation that we can and should make, and the profession is worth it... we're working towards it, but we haven’t actually gotten there yet.These discussions highlight the links that technologists establish between different moral frameworks as they respond to a complex set of challenges. While they expressed concern about the value that care holds in society, increasing the pecuniary value of car was viewed as infeasible. Technologists responded to this problem by appealing to the status of the profession. However, technologists most defined solutions came in the form of staffing algorithms.4.2 Datafying CareWe unpack staffing practices at CareTech, which we argue are emblematic of technological solutionism. Our analysis reveals that technologists associated different aspects of staffing algorithms with different moral frameworks. We argue that how decisions are made about who is best suited for particular shifts—and why—is changing with the advent and implementation of algorithmic staffing tools as technologists prioritize efficiency. However, discussions with technologists show that there are tensions present in the use of algorithms. On the one hand, technologists discussed their work in terms of trying to increase caregiver performance. Performance Evaluation metrics break care into a set of constituent elements closely aligned with operational efficiency (an appeal to the indus-trial moral framework). On the other hand, technologists described their work as oriented toward establishing long-term relationships between caregivers and care recipients (an appeal to the domestic moral framework).The metrics and measurements that support algorithmic staffing practices are most closely associated with notions of productivity and operational efficiency. Technologists presented one part of their work as oriented toward increasing the “performance, or perceived performance of the caregiver” (Floyd). They described how this work is accomplished by measuring: (1) timeliness (how frequently a caregiver arrives to a shift on time); (2) consistency (adherence to schedule shifts); (3) application usage (whether or not the caregiver uses the application to clock in to and out of shifts and evaluate care recipient well-being); and (4) call-offs (shifts not released seven days in advance). While this evaluation practice makes care legible based on a discrete set of metrics, the composition of these metrics is oriented toward operational efficiency rather than the experiences of care recipients or care coordinators.Technologists contrasted their work with platforms in the ride-hailing industry7, describing how their work was motivated by the desire to establish long-term relationships between caregivers and care recipients. They referenced algorithms in terms that framed care as a holistic practice, often comparing the product of their work to other intimate relationships. Staffing algorithms have a role at two main sites: as initial schedules were made and when other caregivers called off their shifts. When caregivers are scheduled during their onboarding, staff members at CareTech use algorithmic recommendation systems to match caregivers with care recipients.In both cases, platform architects compared the matching process to other intimate relations between caregivers and care recipients.In Sandra’s words: Once the data are all collected, [the algorithm] gives us a list of caregivers, and it was ranked by most likely to be picked up by the caregiver...there is a...I don't want to say negotiating, but there are conversations that go back and forth. Because it does become an arranged marriage when you’re putting it inside thehome.In instances where shifts opened up with clients, the platform gives caregivers the option to pick up shifts with these clients through a user interface that Floyd described as “not not tinder 8 inspired. In advancing these relationship-based arguments, technologists define quality care by referencing domestic relationships between caregivers and care recipients.On the one hand, technologists seek to build a platform that effi-ciently delivers consistent care to a growing number of older adult care recipients. On the other, they describe their work as motivated by a desire to optimize relationships between caregivers and care recipients. At the same time, they framed their efforts as improving fairness, accountability, and transparency in staffing practices. Pair-ing discussions of metrics—which break care down into constituent elements associated with industrial efficiency—with algorithms staffing practices—which technologists use to frame evaluation in domestic terms—reveals that these actors associate different parts of their job with distinct moral frameworks to meet a complex set of demands. Further, interviews with caregivers and coordinators reveal that these performance evaluation criteria and platform staffing practices are a source of tension and stress.4.3 Platform AsymmetriesWhat are the consequences of technologists’ actions? To answer this question, we turn to platform caregivers’ and care coordinators’ per-spectives and experiences. Contrary to technologists’ aspirations touse algorithms to build a fairer, more transparent order, algorithmic staffing practices in fact created new conditions of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. First, we focus on evaluation practices.CareTech’s app for caregivers displays ratings across several met-rics related to operational aspects of care delivery (i.e., timeliness,consistency, application usage, and call-offs). The platform also sends weekly caregiver evaluation surveys to coordinators but does not share this feedback directly with caregivers. Further, caregivers rarely received qualitative feedback regarding the quality of care they provided. Caregivers discussed how these aspects of platform design contributed to ambiguity regarding insight into their perfor-mance, while coordinators approached completing survey-based caregiver evaluations with ambivalence. Second, we analyze care-givers’ interactions with CareTech’s staffing practices. Caregivers described experiencing collapsed boundaries between working and personal time. Despite these new challenges, the caregivers and coordinators we interviewed did not mention a desire to leave. .4.3.1 Ambiguity and Ambivalence. While caregivers described providing care as meaningful and were generally content with the conditions they faced on the platform, they discussed a lack of clarity regarding expectations and performance. As Hayden said:I believe that the clients, they also rate us after every shift. So then if we get rated lowly every time or pretty consistently, I’m sure they will reach out tous...I don’t know that it helps us rate our care and how well we’re doing with our clients, but I don't know how else they could do that...you hear stories of people who are dissatisfied with their care, and that's hard to tell.It was only after connecting with other caregivers that Hayden Learned that it was possible to request a performance evaluation form CareTech. Further, the opacity of metrics created feelings of worry for care-givers about their performance. As a new caregiver on the platform,Hazel worried about a low client consistency rating and discussed needing to take the initiative to understand why she received low ratings across other metrics. Puzzled about low application usage ratings, Hazel described needing to reach out to CareTech to understand “what [she] was missing.” CareTech’s communication and evaluation practices created unclear situations with multiple interpretations and required additional labor on the part of caregivers to understand how care recipients experienced their care and how the platform judged their performance. Coordinators, on the other hand, discussed their own evaluation practices as infused with ambivalence—a finding that we found surprising given the intimate and impactful context of care for an older loved one. While coordinators described clear feelings about the care provided to loved ones, our interviewees responded to CareTech’s evaluation surveys inconsistently. Coordinators expressed satisfaction with the care that caregivers provided and thus did not feel a need to fill out the company’s weekly care-giver evaluation survey, described how these surveys were not as useful compared to in-person evaluations performed over more extended periods, or expressed that they did not feel their feedback through these outlets was listened to by CareTech. Phyllis—who lives with her care recipient—described that since the quality of care was so consistent, there was not a need to be very detailed in her evaluations: “they will send out those [surveys] weekly...soyou click on attentiveness, preparation, and I don’t remember what they all are. There’s about five of them. I don’t get very detailed.” On The other hand, Brooks—who did not live with his care recipient,and was dissatisfied with the consistency of staffing provided byCareTech—described feeling overwhelmed by the amount of eval-uating he was asked to do: “For each one of the caregivers that has been in, they’re asking for an opinion for eight to 10 caregivers everyMonday, on the same thing, the same people doing the same thing.I’ve had a hard time seeing the value on a weekly basis.” He saw more value in evaluations carried out over longer intervals as it had been before the acquisition. There used to be the quarterly report where they would actually go in and visit and come back and say,‘this has changed, or this looks like it’s changed’...when someone steps in four or five times a year those are the ones that can pick out some things.Opal, who uses CareTech to provide care to her husband, discussed her attitude towards the surveys: “Honestly, I ignore [the surveys]. It’s not something I want to do. I don’t know why. I know they're doing great.” These perspectives demonstrate a difference in the worth actors ascribed to particular evaluation practices, high-lighting a mismatch between technologists’, coordinators’, and care-givers’ perspectives. Other coordinators described non-use of CareTech’s evaluation infrastructure, even when there were striking departures from care expectations. Coordinators justified their approach by appealing to different moral frameworks. Riley said, “what did happen onetime, and I should probably be more tuned into it...there was one day when one of the caregivers didn’t show up at all. And I didn't know about it until the next day.” She justified the non-use through appeals to a domestic moral framework: “I’m not as hands-on, I’mnot looking at the app to see what they’re doing. I get my feedback on how they’re doing from my mom and dad.” Winnie, who relied on a caregiver to transport her mother to church on Sunday mornings, described situations where sometimes a caregiver assigned to the shift couldn’t drive or had no car. Even so, she did not fill out regular surveys, drawing on her experience as a business owner (industrial)to express that she understood the challenges of staffing shifts: “it’sa very hard thing to maneuver in the world that we’re walking in. We Own a small business. We employ 13 ladies, so I understand.” At the same time, she seemed to negatively moralize non-use: “I will be honest with you that a survey has come...I haven’t filled it out. So I Haven't done due diligence on my part. You know, so I’m going to own that part.” While some coordinators expressed frustration about consistency, communication, quality, and the efficacy of evaluation practices, they appealed to multiple moral frameworks to justify different uses of evaluation infrastructure.4.3.2 Work Practices and Professional Boundaries. Continued dis-cussion with caregivers provided insight into how the problems that technologists faced contributed to aspects of platform design.The need to fill open shifts and coordinate care work across multiple individuals—associated with an industrial moral framework—took precedence over other concerns. Francine’s account of interactions with CareTech provides an example of how the need to staff shifts devalued communication about performance: “they have never given me any feedback or evaluation, the only time they call is about the schedule, asking if you can work more.” We argue that technologists prioritization of needs associated with the industrial moral frame-work eroded the boundary between caregivers’ work and personal lives and changed care practices.For example, the platform uses a notification system to bring open shifts to caregivers’ attention. However, Pepper describe how the constant notification stream makes it difficult for her to differentiate between work and leisure time:I can tell they have a lot of shifts to fill in. Am I go-ing to be under pressure? They’ve asked me for five things, and you said no to all of them, it feels likeI should say yes to something now. It’s just a little harder to be either working or not working...when you see your phone in the morning and you see all those notifications there.Hayden described receiving “30 to 40” notifications a day from the app, even after reaching out to CareTech to express that they would not work any more shifts. Further, they described confu-sion and frustration regarding the processes by which shifts were initially assigned:I actually said no to [the shift], but they scheduled me anyway. Which was how I got a lot of my shifts,which was okay...I know sometimes it sounds weird,but I would say no to a shift, maybe they’d think thatI said yes.This account suggests that the platform does not allow for as much flexibility as technologists imagine.In contrast to legacy record-keeping procedures, where care-givers left paper-based care notes in clients’ homes, CareTech’splatform requires that caregivers describe their shifts upon clock-ing out in an electronic journal that is viewable by coordinators and other caregivers. While caregivers described that the journal helped them feel more prepared for each shift, they also described reading journal entries outside of working hours, which provided further evidence for blurred boundaries between work and personal life.For example, Chauncey described reading entries “at night, before Igo to bed, I start reading if I’m going to work the next morning.” In Addition, platform architecture requiring caregivers to complete these logs changed caregivers’ relationship to time spent on the job. Francine described how filling out the notes, especially in the time-sensitive context of a shift, placed pressure on how she spent time providing care: “if you clock out right at a minute after [your shift ends] they get you on that.” Efforts to avoid disciplinary action created new relationships to time: “I just always try to clock out a few minutes before because you get all these questions before closing out the app” (Francine). In these cases, platform architecture changed caregivers' relationships with their time both on and off the clock,which put caregivers under additional pressure.We found that aspects of platform and algorithm design create new forms of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. We argue that this results from a mismatch between technologists’ moral reasoning and that of other platform actors. In addition, the need to fill open shifts and coordinate work across many individuals pri-oritizes a logic of efficiency over concerns for caregiver job quality.Despite coordinators’ unmet expectations and new pressures that the platform placed on caregivers, both sets of actors maintain a commitment to the platform. A possible explanation for contin-ued attachment is the moral significance of ‘care.’ While the term carries various meanings across actors and situations, it may act as a resource that maintains a particular status quo by mitigating organized critique of or departure from the platform.

Convenience Sampling limited the extent to which we were able to understand differences across demographic subgroups. Future work should explore this issue. Further, recruitment overlooked the perspectives of care coordinators and caregivers who have left the platform due to difficulties This study draws on data gathered from one week of observations performed in July 2022 and 30 interviews conducted between May2022 and August 2022. We conducted in-depth interviews to understand the cultural inputs that shape algorithm design and the implications for caregivers and coordinators. Interviews are well-suited for understanding social dimensions of how people interpret the world and take actions based on those interpretations [64]. Interviews with technology workers show how they make sense of their work and build systems [67], and interviews with caregivers and coordinators show that care practices diverge from organizational philosophy [53]. After several interviews, one researcher visitedStayHome’s global headquarters and a company-owned agency,located in a major Midwestern city in the U.S. The researcher toured the company’s offices and met with support staff. In addition, theresearcher engaged these actors in informal conversations to learn how StayHome and CareTech operate. To understand how the plat-form is presented to caregivers and what aspects of paid care work are emphasized, the researcher observed a caregiver training ses-sion on lifting and transferring techniques at one of StayHome’scompany-owned franchises and attended a virtual onboarding ses-sion with CareTech in the afternoon.We developed the interview guide with interest in valuation and evaluation practices as they occur on CareTech’s platform. Treating valuation as a moral outlook, we drew on practice-oriented approaches to understanding how different actors conceptualize and contribute value in labor contexts [36]. Examining the practices of the people that develop platforms and those who are subject to their architecture provides an opportunity to identify the underlying justifications and actions that shape and transform care work as it occurs on the ground. Interview questions thus sought to elicit interviewees' daily practices, what elements of their work they described as most important, the least favorite aspects of their work,and their ideological orientation towards the concept of ‘care.’After obtaining consent, we recorded the interviews, which lasted between 45 and 90 minutes and took place mainly over Zoom. However, we did interview several caregivers and one coordinator in person. Team members iteratively refined these themes through discussion and mapped them to the EoW framework. We used a third-party qualitative coding tool (NVivo) to complete the coding process. To make theoretical sense of the data, we returned to the literature and iterated between data and extant research. Our findings indicate that technologists drew on several economies of worth—which we refer to as moral frameworks—to navigate the seemingly irreconcilable demands of home care. They referenced multiple interpretations of the term ‘care’ to resolve contradictions.We illustrate this point by first focusing on how technologists described the problems that they claim to solve. Then, we analyze the nature of the solutions they presented, highlighting how technolo-gists imbued different aspects of algorithm design and function with moral meanings. This finding demonstrates the interpretive flexibil-ity of technological artifacts. Finally, we turn to the perspectives of caregivers and coordinators. Their accounts show how algorithmic staffing practices created new forms of uncertainty—the mirror of technologists' stated intentions.4.1 Navigating Contextual ComplexityTechnologists drew on multiple moral frameworks to navigate expectations and demands, appealing to various interpretations of care’ to reconcile the contradictory pressures they face. The technologists we interviewed framed CareTech as a platform developed to address traditional home care agencies’ logistical and opera-tional challenges. In this context, they appealed to an industrial moral framework, framing their work as introducing greater levels of efficiency and rationalization to the home care industry. How-ever, many of the technologists we interviewed also framed their work in terms of a civic moral framework, critiquing prior staffing practices as subjective, opaque, unfair, and harmful to the material well-being of caregivers. Although these two narratives may appear contradictory, technologists unified these demands by appealing to the societal need for more care. For example, improvements inefficiency were discussed in terms of increasing the affordability of care while improving working conditions was imagined as growing the size of the caregiving workforce. We argue that technologists navigate complexity when creating and developing care algorithms by strategically appealing to justifications corresponding to differ-ent moral frameworks, drawing on multiple interpretations of a single term to move between them. Throughout this section, we draw attention to how technologists position algorithmic staffing practices as one solution to the problems they described.4.1.1 Platform Description & Motivations. The rhetoric that tech-nologists and company executives used to describe their motivation for building the platform appealed to domestic and social goods. In press releases and on the company website, CareTech’s execu-tives described their frustrations in searching for care for their own parents. Similarly, technologists invoked ideas of familial respon-sibility, relaying stories about their difficulties in finding care for aging parents. Technologists also drew on more civic-oriented no-tions of good, framing their work with reference to positive social change. For example, Richard described, “being part of something that can have a positive impact on society.” The company’s mission statement, was described as ‘improving care in society6, highlight-ing the significance of a single moral concept in technologists discourse.In discussing the company’s strategy, the technologists we in-terviewed described CareTech as a “platform,” “communication company,” or “logistical engine,”, foregrounding CareTech’s use of digital technology to improve efficiency, and framed their work asa response to logistical challenges in the home care industry. Aiden described what he framed as the company’s main value proposition:I think the big sort of sell is, it is getting harder and harder to operate care. I think it is getting more expensive...the core value proposition is where we are trying to figure out how to build a platform around doing this, and helping agencies focus more on their relationships with their communities and customers.He elaborated that, by centralizing operations, CareTech offers partner agencies relief from work that is “consuming and grueling,whether it’s paperwork, management, documentation, staffing, lo-gistics, or being on call all the time.” By filling this role, CareTech‘frees up agencies to both source customers and maintain that rela-tionship and kind of connection’ (Aiden). Repeated references to the relationship between CareTech and the agencies with which it partners serve two purposes. First, they identify areas whereCareTech uses technology to increase efficiency in the home care industry. This problem formulation provides the background for how organizational solutions are framed. Second, they format a division of labor. In this account, partner agencies are positioned as responsible for managing relationships in local markets, while the platform oversees aspects of labor control and management.Here, technologists frame the platform’s work in industrial terms and partner agencies in domestic terms. 4.1.2 Staffing Practices as Solutions. As they justified their work,technologists also blended elements from multiple moral frame-works. Specifically, they simultaneously appealed to notions of market dominance and civic responsibility. This overlap materialized as Robert, a data scientist, stated that the company’s scale offered a ‘unified view across markets’ and provided access to a sufficient amount of data to use statistical techniques to ‘learn from the data to provide better home care’, serving as a “competitive dif-ferentiator in the market.” In addition, Floyd framed the company's size as affording more ‘careful’ staffing practice:From a systemic perspective, when you are bigger you have these systems in place, and you do not have to guilt somebody into working a shift. If you need a shift filled, you have a stable of hundreds of caregivers you can reach out to, it is just a matter of how much bonus you have to put on it.These rhetorical strategies demonstrate how technologists draw on multiple moral frameworks to present their work as solutions to different problems.Building on discussions of CareTech’s organizational strategy,technologists most concretely articulated their efforts toward ‘im-proving care in society’ through labor management. They started these discussions by problematizing caregiver job quality under legacy home care practices as associated with low wages, few ben-efits, rigid scheduling practices, and little recognition of caregivers efforts. Kennedy critiqued legacy staffing practices on the grounds of fairness and transparency:There’s a lot of favoritism that happens. There’s a lack of transparency. And so as you can imagine, the caregivers who work the most shifts, they’re able to earn the most amount of money. And that’s really helping to improve their lives and livelihoods. Other technologists framed algorithmic staffing as a solution to the legacy staffing practices that Kennedy identified as opaque and unfair. While Kennedy incorporated concerns about material well-being into her critiques, other technologists generally avoided discussing their efforts toward increasing caregiver job quality in terms of a market-based moral framework. This may have resulted from the market constraints of care, where the price for private pay home care is inaccessible for many families. Aria explainedthat raising wages for caregivers would make the price of care“unpayable” by many clients. 4.1.3 Professionalizing Care. Instead, technologists framed their efforts as attempts to improve caregivers’ status and provide them with a career. Aria noted that improving the collective status of caregivers was part of CareTech’s mission since its founding, em-phasizing challenging aspects of the job:I think that a really big piece of what CareTech is try-ing to do and has been trying to do since the beginning you know, elevate the profession of caregiving. Andtruly treat it a profession instead of just a job...because it's a difficult, emotionally intense, sometimes physi-cally intense thing to do.Floyd described further aspirations to elevate caregivers’ status through professionalization:I would say that [career] is a north star for us. I think everyone views that as an innovation that we can and should make, and the profession is worth it... we're working towards it, but we haven’t actually gotten there yet.These discussions highlight the links that technologists establish between different moral frameworks as they respond to a complex set of challenges. While they expressed concern about the value that care holds in society, increasing the pecuniary value of car was viewed as infeasible. Technologists responded to this problem by appealing to the status of the profession. However, technologists most defined solutions came in the form of staffing algorithms.4.2 Datafying CareWe unpack staffing practices at CareTech, which we argue are emblematic of technological solutionism. Our analysis reveals that technologists associated different aspects of staffing algorithms with different moral frameworks. We argue that how decisions are made about who is best suited for particular shifts—and why—is changing with the advent and implementation of algorithmic staffing tools as technologists prioritize efficiency. However, discussions with technologists show that there are tensions present in the use of algorithms. On the one hand, technologists discussed their work in terms of trying to increase caregiver performance. Performance Evaluation metrics break care into a set of constituent elements closely aligned with operational efficiency (an appeal to the indus-trial moral framework). On the other hand, technologists described their work as oriented toward establishing long-term relationships between caregivers and care recipients (an appeal to the domestic moral framework).The metrics and measurements that support algorithmic staffing practices are most closely associated with notions of productivity and operational efficiency. Technologists presented one part of their work as oriented toward increasing the “performance, or perceived performance of the caregiver” (Floyd). They described how this work is accomplished by measuring: (1) timeliness (how frequently a caregiver arrives to a shift on time); (2) consistency (adherence to schedule shifts); (3) application usage (whether or not the caregiver uses the application to clock in to and out of shifts and evaluate care recipient well-being); and (4) call-offs (shifts not released seven days in advance). While this evaluation practice makes care legible based on a discrete set of metrics, the composition of these metrics is oriented toward operational efficiency rather than the experiences of care recipients or care coordinators.Technologists contrasted their work with platforms in the ride-hailing industry7, describing how their work was motivated by the desire to establish long-term relationships between caregivers and care recipients. They referenced algorithms in terms that framed care as a holistic practice, often comparing the product of their work to other intimate relationships. Staffing algorithms have a role at two main sites: as initial schedules were made and when other caregivers called off their shifts. When caregivers are scheduled during their onboarding, staff members at CareTech use algorithmic recommendation systems to match caregivers with care recipients.In both cases, platform architects compared the matching process to other intimate relations between caregivers and care recipients.In Sandra’s words: Once the data are all collected, [the algorithm] gives us a list of caregivers, and it was ranked by most likely to be picked up by the caregiver...there is a...I don't want to say negotiating, but there are conversations that go back and forth. Because it does become an arranged marriage when you’re putting it inside thehome.In instances where shifts opened up with clients, the platform gives caregivers the option to pick up shifts with these clients through a user interface that Floyd described as “not not tinder 8 inspired. In advancing these relationship-based arguments, technologists define quality care by referencing domestic relationships between caregivers and care recipients.On the one hand, technologists seek to build a platform that effi-ciently delivers consistent care to a growing number of older adult care recipients. On the other, they describe their work as motivated by a desire to optimize relationships between caregivers and care recipients. At the same time, they framed their efforts as improving fairness, accountability, and transparency in staffing practices. Pair-ing discussions of metrics—which break care down into constituent elements associated with industrial efficiency—with algorithms staffing practices—which technologists use to frame evaluation in domestic terms—reveals that these actors associate different parts of their job with distinct moral frameworks to meet a complex set of demands. Further, interviews with caregivers and coordinators reveal that these performance evaluation criteria and platform staffing practices are a source of tension and stress.4.3 Platform AsymmetriesWhat are the consequences of technologists’ actions? To answer this question, we turn to platform caregivers’ and care coordinators’ per-spectives and experiences. Contrary to technologists’ aspirations touse algorithms to build a fairer, more transparent order, algorithmic staffing practices in fact created new conditions of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. First, we focus on evaluation practices.CareTech’s app for caregivers displays ratings across several met-rics related to operational aspects of care delivery (i.e., timeliness,consistency, application usage, and call-offs). The platform also sends weekly caregiver evaluation surveys to coordinators but does not share this feedback directly with caregivers. Further, caregivers rarely received qualitative feedback regarding the quality of care they provided. Caregivers discussed how these aspects of platform design contributed to ambiguity regarding insight into their perfor-mance, while coordinators approached completing survey-based caregiver evaluations with ambivalence. Second, we analyze care-givers’ interactions with CareTech’s staffing practices. Caregivers described experiencing collapsed boundaries between working and personal time. Despite these new challenges, the caregivers and coordinators we interviewed did not mention a desire to leave. .4.3.1 Ambiguity and Ambivalence. While caregivers described providing care as meaningful and were generally content with the conditions they faced on the platform, they discussed a lack of clarity regarding expectations and performance. As Hayden said:I believe that the clients, they also rate us after every shift. So then if we get rated lowly every time or pretty consistently, I’m sure they will reach out tous...I don’t know that it helps us rate our care and how well we’re doing with our clients, but I don't know how else they could do that...you hear stories of people who are dissatisfied with their care, and that's hard to tell.It was only after connecting with other caregivers that Hayden Learned that it was possible to request a performance evaluation form CareTech. Further, the opacity of metrics created feelings of worry for care-givers about their performance. As a new caregiver on the platform,Hazel worried about a low client consistency rating and discussed needing to take the initiative to understand why she received low ratings across other metrics. Puzzled about low application usage ratings, Hazel described needing to reach out to CareTech to understand “what [she] was missing.” CareTech’s communication and evaluation practices created unclear situations with multiple interpretations and required additional labor on the part of caregivers to understand how care recipients experienced their care and how the platform judged their performance. Coordinators, on the other hand, discussed their own evaluation practices as infused with ambivalence—a finding that we found surprising given the intimate and impactful context of care for an older loved one. While coordinators described clear feelings about the care provided to loved ones, our interviewees responded to CareTech’s evaluation surveys inconsistently. Coordinators expressed satisfaction with the care that caregivers provided and thus did not feel a need to fill out the company’s weekly care-giver evaluation survey, described how these surveys were not as useful compared to in-person evaluations performed over more extended periods, or expressed that they did not feel their feedback through these outlets was listened to by CareTech. Phyllis—who lives with her care recipient—described that since the quality of care was so consistent, there was not a need to be very detailed in her evaluations: “they will send out those [surveys] weekly...soyou click on attentiveness, preparation, and I don’t remember what they all are. There’s about five of them. I don’t get very detailed.” On The other hand, Brooks—who did not live with his care recipient,and was dissatisfied with the consistency of staffing provided byCareTech—described feeling overwhelmed by the amount of eval-uating he was asked to do: “For each one of the caregivers that has been in, they’re asking for an opinion for eight to 10 caregivers everyMonday, on the same thing, the same people doing the same thing.I’ve had a hard time seeing the value on a weekly basis.” He saw more value in evaluations carried out over longer intervals as it had been before the acquisition. There used to be the quarterly report where they would actually go in and visit and come back and say,‘this has changed, or this looks like it’s changed’...when someone steps in four or five times a year those are the ones that can pick out some things.Opal, who uses CareTech to provide care to her husband, discussed her attitude towards the surveys: “Honestly, I ignore [the surveys]. It’s not something I want to do. I don’t know why. I know they're doing great.” These perspectives demonstrate a difference in the worth actors ascribed to particular evaluation practices, high-lighting a mismatch between technologists’, coordinators’, and care-givers’ perspectives. Other coordinators described non-use of CareTech’s evaluation infrastructure, even when there were striking departures from care expectations. Coordinators justified their approach by appealing to different moral frameworks. Riley said, “what did happen onetime, and I should probably be more tuned into it...there was one day when one of the caregivers didn’t show up at all. And I didn't know about it until the next day.” She justified the non-use through appeals to a domestic moral framework: “I’m not as hands-on, I’mnot looking at the app to see what they’re doing. I get my feedback on how they’re doing from my mom and dad.” Winnie, who relied on a caregiver to transport her mother to church on Sunday mornings, described situations where sometimes a caregiver assigned to the shift couldn’t drive or had no car. Even so, she did not fill out regular surveys, drawing on her experience as a business owner (industrial)to express that she understood the challenges of staffing shifts: “it’sa very hard thing to maneuver in the world that we’re walking in. We Own a small business. We employ 13 ladies, so I understand.” At the same time, she seemed to negatively moralize non-use: “I will be honest with you that a survey has come...I haven’t filled it out. So I Haven't done due diligence on my part. You know, so I’m going to own that part.” While some coordinators expressed frustration about consistency, communication, quality, and the efficacy of evaluation practices, they appealed to multiple moral frameworks to justify different uses of evaluation infrastructure.4.3.2 Work Practices and Professional Boundaries. Continued dis-cussion with caregivers provided insight into how the problems that technologists faced contributed to aspects of platform design.The need to fill open shifts and coordinate care work across multiple individuals—associated with an industrial moral framework—took precedence over other concerns. Francine’s account of interactions with CareTech provides an example of how the need to staff shifts devalued communication about performance: “they have never given me any feedback or evaluation, the only time they call is about the schedule, asking if you can work more.” We argue that technologists prioritization of needs associated with the industrial moral frame-work eroded the boundary between caregivers’ work and personal lives and changed care practices.For example, the platform uses a notification system to bring open shifts to caregivers’ attention. However, Pepper describe how the constant notification stream makes it difficult for her to differentiate between work and leisure time:I can tell they have a lot of shifts to fill in. Am I go-ing to be under pressure? They’ve asked me for five things, and you said no to all of them, it feels likeI should say yes to something now. It’s just a little harder to be either working or not working...when you see your phone in the morning and you see all those notifications there.Hayden described receiving “30 to 40” notifications a day from the app, even after reaching out to CareTech to express that they would not work any more shifts. Further, they described confu-sion and frustration regarding the processes by which shifts were initially assigned:I actually said no to [the shift], but they scheduled me anyway. Which was how I got a lot of my shifts,which was okay...I know sometimes it sounds weird,but I would say no to a shift, maybe they’d think thatI said yes.This account suggests that the platform does not allow for as much flexibility as technologists imagine.In contrast to legacy record-keeping procedures, where care-givers left paper-based care notes in clients’ homes, CareTech’splatform requires that caregivers describe their shifts upon clock-ing out in an electronic journal that is viewable by coordinators and other caregivers. While caregivers described that the journal helped them feel more prepared for each shift, they also described reading journal entries outside of working hours, which provided further evidence for blurred boundaries between work and personal life.For example, Chauncey described reading entries “at night, before Igo to bed, I start reading if I’m going to work the next morning.” In Addition, platform architecture requiring caregivers to complete these logs changed caregivers’ relationship to time spent on the job. Francine described how filling out the notes, especially in the time-sensitive context of a shift, placed pressure on how she spent time providing care: “if you clock out right at a minute after [your shift ends] they get you on that.” Efforts to avoid disciplinary action created new relationships to time: “I just always try to clock out a few minutes before because you get all these questions before closing out the app” (Francine). In these cases, platform architecture changed caregivers' relationships with their time both on and off the clock,which put caregivers under additional pressure.We found that aspects of platform and algorithm design create new forms of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. We argue that this results from a mismatch between technologists’ moral reasoning and that of other platform actors. In addition, the need to fill open shifts and coordinate work across many individuals pri-oritizes a logic of efficiency over concerns for caregiver job quality.Despite coordinators’ unmet expectations and new pressures that the platform placed on caregivers, both sets of actors maintain a commitment to the platform. A possible explanation for contin-ued attachment is the moral significance of ‘care.’ While the term carries various meanings across actors and situations, it may act as a resource that maintains a particular status quo by mitigating organized critique of or departure from the platform.

23,Metrics,Artifact,"The subject of our case study, CareTech4, is one of several start-upsthat are credited with “reinventing the [home care] agency model”[22]. Prior to data collection, CareTech acquired StayHome, a traditional home care agency franchise. To contextualize our findings,we briefly discuss CareTech’s business model.CareTech partners with traditional home care agencies to support back-end administrative, legal, compliance, and logistics functions in exchange for a share of partner agencies’ revenue, employing caregivers directly. Caregivers assist with activities of daily living(i.e., bathing, dressing, getting in or out of a bed or chair, walking,using the toilet, eating) [43], and instrumental activities of daily living (i.e., cooking, cleaning, transportation, laundry, managing finances) [46]. CareTech’s use of algorithms to match caregivers to care recipients is central to our case. When we started data collection, CareTech’s technology platform had recently been im-plemented at StayHome’s company-owned agencies, providing a unique opportunity to investigate care algorithm implementation.In this paper, we focus primarily on CareTech’s staffing prac-tices. CareTech uses metrics and algorithms, along with human management, to staff shifts. Staffing algorithms have a role at two main sites: as initial schedules were made and when other care-givers called off their shifts. When caregivers are scheduled during their onboarding, staff members at CareTech use algorithmic recommendation systems to match caregivers with care recipients. Evaluation metrics (i.e., timeliness, consistency, application usage,and call-offs), along with other data (e.g., caregiver commute time,number of complaints) are used to match caregivers and care recipients. Coordinators receive weekly surveys about the quality of care provided, and provide responses on a linear scale5. After IRB approval, we recruited participants—technologists (n =14), caregivers (n = 9), and coordinators (n = 7)—through a partnership with CareTech and StayHome for interviews using convenience and purposive sampling [10]. StayHome’s research staff arranged site visit and helped recruit participants. We provided a brief description of the study and a screening questionnaire distributed amongst the caregivers and coordinators over email. This approach provided an opportunity to learn from technologists, caregivers,coordinators who were enthusiastic about sharing their experi-ences with the platform. Table 2 and table 3 provide an overview of participant profiles.(1) Technologists: Technologists consisted of software engi-neers, designers, product managers, and data and opera-tions workers.

If you need a shift filled, you have a stable of hundreds of caregivers you can reach out to, it is just a matter of how much bonus you have to put on it.These rhetorical strategies demonstrate how technologists draw on multiple moral frameworks to present their work as solutions to different problems.Building on discussions of CareTech’s organizational strategy,technologists most concretely articulated their efforts toward ‘im-proving care in society’ through labor management. They started these discussions by problematizing caregiver job quality under legacy home care practices as associated with low wages, few ben-efits, rigid scheduling practices, and little recognition of caregivers efforts. Kennedy critiqued legacy staffing practices on the grounds of fairness and transparency:There’s a lot of favoritism that happens. There’s a lack of transparency. And so as you can imagine, the caregivers who work the most shifts, they’re able to earn the most amount of money. And that’s really helping to improve their lives and livelihoods. Other technologists framed algorithmic staffing as a solution to the legacy staffing practices that Kennedy identified as opaque and unfair. While Kennedy incorporated concerns about material well-being into her critiques, other technologists generally avoided discussing their efforts toward increasing caregiver job quality in terms of a market-based moral framework. This may have resulted from the market constraints of care, where the price for private pay home care is inaccessible for many families. Aria explainedthat raising wages for caregivers would make the price of care“unpayable” by many clients. 4.1.3 Professionalizing Care. Instead, technologists framed their efforts as attempts to improve caregivers’ status and provide them with a career. Aria noted that improving the collective status of caregivers was part of CareTech’s mission since its founding, em-phasizing challenging aspects of the job:I think that a really big piece of what CareTech is try-ing to do and has been trying to do since the beginning you know, elevate the profession of caregiving. Andtruly treat it a profession instead of just a job...because it's a difficult, emotionally intense, sometimes physi-cally intense thing to do.Floyd described further aspirations to elevate caregivers’ status through professionalization:I would say that [career] is a north star for us. I think everyone views that as an innovation that we can and should make, and the profession is worth it... we're working towards it, but we haven’t actually gotten there yet.These discussions highlight the links that technologists establish between different moral frameworks as they respond to a complex set of challenges. While they expressed concern about the value that care holds in society, increasing the pecuniary value of car was viewed as infeasible. Technologists responded to this problem by appealing to the status of the profession. However, technologists most defined solutions came in the form of staffing algorithms.4.2 Datafying CareWe unpack staffing practices at CareTech, which we argue are emblematic of technological solutionism. Our analysis reveals that technologists associated different aspects of staffing algorithms with different moral frameworks. We argue that how decisions are made about who is best suited for particular shifts—and why—is changing with the advent and implementation of algorithmic staffing tools as technologists prioritize efficiency. However, discussions with technologists show that there are tensions present in the use of algorithms. On the one hand, technologists discussed their work in terms of trying to increase caregiver performance. Performance Evaluation metrics break care into a set of constituent elements closely aligned with operational efficiency (an appeal to the indus-trial moral framework). On the other hand, technologists described their work as oriented toward establishing long-term relationships between caregivers and care recipients (an appeal to the domestic moral framework).The metrics and measurements that support algorithmic staffing practices are most closely associated with notions of productivity and operational efficiency. Technologists presented one part of their work as oriented toward increasing the “performance, or perceived performance of the caregiver” (Floyd). They described how this work is accomplished by measuring: (1) timeliness (how frequently a caregiver arrives to a shift on time); (2) consistency (adherence to schedule shifts); (3) application usage (whether or not the caregiver uses the application to clock in to and out of shifts and evaluate care recipient well-being); and (4) call-offs (shifts not released seven days in advance). While this evaluation practice makes care legible based on a discrete set of metrics, the composition of these metrics is oriented toward operational efficiency rather than the experiences of care recipients or care coordinators.Technologists contrasted their work with platforms in the ride-hailing industry7, describing how their work was motivated by the desire to establish long-term relationships between caregivers and care recipients. They referenced algorithms in terms that framed care as a holistic practice, often comparing the product of their work to other intimate relationships. Staffing algorithms have a role at two main sites: as initial schedules were made and when other caregivers called off their shifts. When caregivers are scheduled during their onboarding, staff members at CareTech use algorithmic recommendation systems to match caregivers with care recipients.In both cases, platform architects compared the matching process to other intimate relations between caregivers and care recipients.In Sandra’s words: Once the data are all collected, [the algorithm] gives us a list of caregivers, and it was ranked by most likely to be picked up by the caregiver...there is a...I don't want to say negotiating, but there are conversations that go back and forth. Because it does become an arranged marriage when you’re putting it inside thehome.In instances where shifts opened up with clients, the platform gives caregivers the option to pick up shifts with these clients through a user interface that Floyd described as “not not tinder 8 inspired. In advancing these relationship-based arguments, technologists define quality care by referencing domestic relationships between caregivers and care recipients.On the one hand, technologists seek to build a platform that effi-ciently delivers consistent care to a growing number of older adult care recipients. On the other, they describe their work as motivated by a desire to optimize relationships between caregivers and care recipients. At the same time, they framed their efforts as improving fairness, accountability, and transparency in staffing practices. Pair-ing discussions of metrics—which break care down into constituent elements associated with industrial efficiency—with algorithms staffing practices—which technologists use to frame evaluation in domestic terms—reveals that these actors associate different parts of their job with distinct moral frameworks to meet a complex set of demands. Further, interviews with caregivers and coordinators reveal that these performance evaluation criteria and platform staffing practices are a source of tension and stress.4.3 Platform AsymmetriesWhat are the consequences of technologists’ actions? To answer this question, we turn to platform caregivers’ and care coordinators’ per-spectives and experiences. Contrary to technologists’ aspirations touse algorithms to build a fairer, more transparent order, algorithmic staffing practices in fact created new conditions of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. First, we focus on evaluation practices.CareTech’s app for caregivers displays ratings across several met-rics related to operational aspects of care delivery (i.e., timeliness,consistency, application usage, and call-offs). The platform also sends weekly caregiver evaluation surveys to coordinators but does not share this feedback directly with caregivers. Further, caregivers rarely received qualitative feedback regarding the quality of care they provided. Caregivers discussed how these aspects of platform design contributed to ambiguity regarding insight into their perfor-mance, while coordinators approached completing survey-based caregiver evaluations with ambivalence. Second, we analyze care-givers’ interactions with CareTech’s staffing practices. Caregivers described experiencing collapsed boundaries between working and personal time. Despite these new challenges, the caregivers and coordinators we interviewed did not mention a desire to leave. .4.3.1 Ambiguity and Ambivalence. While caregivers described providing care as meaningful and were generally content with the conditions they faced on the platform, they discussed a lack of clarity regarding expectations and performance. As Hayden said:I believe that the clients, they also rate us after every shift. So then if we get rated lowly every time or pretty consistently, I’m sure they will reach out tous...I don’t know that it helps us rate our care and how well we’re doing with our clients, but I don't know how else they could do that...you hear stories of people who are dissatisfied with their care, and that's hard to tell.It was only after connecting with other caregivers that Hayden Learned that it was possible to request a performance evaluation form CareTech. Further, the opacity of metrics created feelings of worry for care-givers about their performance. As a new caregiver on the platform,Hazel worried about a low client consistency rating and discussed needing to take the initiative to understand why she received low ratings across other metrics. Puzzled about low application usage ratings, Hazel described needing to reach out to CareTech to understand “what [she] was missing.” CareTech’s communication and evaluation practices created unclear situations with multiple interpretations and required additional labor on the part of caregivers to understand how care recipients experienced their care and how the platform judged their performance. Coordinators, on the other hand, discussed their own evaluation practices as infused with ambivalence—a finding that we found surprising given the intimate and impactful context of care for an older loved one. While coordinators described clear feelings about the care provided to loved ones, our interviewees responded to CareTech’s evaluation surveys inconsistently. Coordinators expressed satisfaction with the care that caregivers provided and thus did not feel a need to fill out the company’s weekly care-giver evaluation survey, described how these surveys were not as useful compared to in-person evaluations performed over more extended periods, or expressed that they did not feel their feedback through these outlets was listened to by CareTech. Phyllis—who lives with her care recipient—described that since the quality of care was so consistent, there was not a need to be very detailed in her evaluations: “they will send out those [surveys] weekly...soyou click on attentiveness, preparation, and I don’t remember what they all are. There’s about five of them. I don’t get very detailed.” On The other hand, Brooks—who did not live with his care recipient,and was dissatisfied with the consistency of staffing provided byCareTech—described feeling overwhelmed by the amount of eval-uating he was asked to do: “For each one of the caregivers that has been in, they’re asking for an opinion for eight to 10 caregivers everyMonday, on the same thing, the same people doing the same thing.I’ve had a hard time seeing the value on a weekly basis.” He saw more value in evaluations carried out over longer intervals as it had been before the acquisition. There used to be the quarterly report where they would actually go in and visit and come back and say,‘this has changed, or this looks like it’s changed’...when someone steps in four or five times a year those are the ones that can pick out some things.Opal, who uses CareTech to provide care to her husband, discussed her attitude towards the surveys: “Honestly, I ignore [the surveys]. It’s not something I want to do. I don’t know why. I know they're doing great.” These perspectives demonstrate a difference in the worth actors ascribed to particular evaluation practices, high-lighting a mismatch between technologists’, coordinators’, and care-givers’ perspectives. Other coordinators described non-use of CareTech’s evaluation infrastructure, even when there were striking departures from care expectations. Coordinators justified their approach by appealing to different moral frameworks. Riley said, “what did happen onetime, and I should probably be more tuned into it...there was one day when one of the caregivers didn’t show up at all. And I didn't know about it until the next day.” She justified the non-use through appeals to a domestic moral framework: “I’m not as hands-on, I’mnot looking at the app to see what they’re doing. I get my feedback on how they’re doing from my mom and dad.” Winnie, who relied on a caregiver to transport her mother to church on Sunday mornings, described situations where sometimes a caregiver assigned to the shift couldn’t drive or had no car. Even so, she did not fill out regular surveys, drawing on her experience as a business owner (industrial)to express that she understood the challenges of staffing shifts: “it’sa very hard thing to maneuver in the world that we’re walking in. We Own a small business. We employ 13 ladies, so I understand.” At the same time, she seemed to negatively moralize non-use: “I will be honest with you that a survey has come...I haven’t filled it out. So I Haven't done due diligence on my part. You know, so I’m going to own that part.” While some coordinators expressed frustration about consistency, communication, quality, and the efficacy of evaluation practices, they appealed to multiple moral frameworks to justify different uses of evaluation infrastructure.4.3.2 Work Practices and Professional Boundaries. Continued dis-cussion with caregivers provided insight into how the problems that technologists faced contributed to aspects of platform design.The need to fill open shifts and coordinate care work across multiple individuals—associated with an industrial moral framework—took precedence over other concerns. Francine’s account of interactions with CareTech provides an example of how the need to staff shifts devalued communication about performance: “they have never given me any feedback or evaluation, the only time they call is about the schedule, asking if you can work more.” We argue that technologists prioritization of needs associated with the industrial moral frame-work eroded the boundary between caregivers’ work and personal lives and changed care practices.For example, the platform uses a notification system to bring open shifts to caregivers’ attention. However, Pepper describe how the constant notification stream makes it difficult for her to differentiate between work and leisure time:I can tell they have a lot of shifts to fill in. Am I go-ing to be under pressure? They’ve asked me for five things, and you said no to all of them, it feels likeI should say yes to something now. It’s just a little harder to be either working or not working...when you see your phone in the morning and you see all those notifications there.Hayden described receiving “30 to 40” notifications a day from the app, even after reaching out to CareTech to express that they would not work any more shifts. Further, they described confu-sion and frustration regarding the processes by which shifts were initially assigned:I actually said no to [the shift], but they scheduled me anyway. Which was how I got a lot of my shifts,which was okay...I know sometimes it sounds weird,but I would say no to a shift, maybe they’d think thatI said yes.This account suggests that the platform does not allow for as much flexibility as technologists imagine.In contrast to legacy record-keeping procedures, where care-givers left paper-based care notes in clients’ homes, CareTech’splatform requires that caregivers describe their shifts upon clock-ing out in an electronic journal that is viewable by coordinators and other caregivers. While caregivers described that the journal helped them feel more prepared for each shift, they also described reading journal entries outside of working hours, which provided further evidence for blurred boundaries between work and personal life.For example, Chauncey described reading entries “at night, before Igo to bed, I start reading if I’m going to work the next morning.” In Addition, platform architecture requiring caregivers to complete these logs changed caregivers’ relationship to time spent on the job. Francine described how filling out the notes, especially in the time-sensitive context of a shift, placed pressure on how she spent time providing care: “if you clock out right at a minute after [your shift ends] they get you on that.” Efforts to avoid disciplinary action created new relationships to time: “I just always try to clock out a few minutes before because you get all these questions before closing out the app” (Francine). In these cases, platform architecture changed caregivers' relationships with their time both on and off the clock,which put caregivers under additional pressure.We found that aspects of platform and algorithm design create new forms of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. We argue that this results from a mismatch between technologists’ moral reasoning and that of other platform actors. In addition, the need to fill open shifts and coordinate work across many individuals pri-oritizes a logic of efficiency over concerns for caregiver job quality.Despite coordinators’ unmet expectations and new pressures that the platform placed on caregivers, both sets of actors maintain a commitment to the platform. A possible explanation for contin-ued attachment is the moral significance of ‘care.’ While the term carries various meanings across actors and situations, it may act as a resource that maintains a particular status quo by mitigating organized critique of or departure from the platform. ","629-30, 631-4",the composition of these metrics,
24,PlatformDesign,Other_Precept,"The subject of our case study, CareTech4, is one of several start-upsthat are credited with “reinventing the [home care] agency model”[22]. Prior to data collection, CareTech acquired StayHome, a traditional home care agency franchise. To contextualize our findings,we briefly discuss CareTech’s business model.CareTech partners with traditional home care agencies to support back-end administrative, legal, compliance, and logistics functions in exchange for a share of partner agencies’ revenue, employing caregivers directly. Caregivers assist with activities of daily living(i.e., bathing, dressing, getting in or out of a bed or chair, walking,using the toilet, eating) [43], and instrumental activities of daily living (i.e., cooking, cleaning, transportation, laundry, managing finances) [46]. CareTech’s use of algorithms to match caregivers to care recipients is central to our case. When we started data collection, CareTech’s technology platform had recently been im-plemented at StayHome’s company-owned agencies, providing a unique opportunity to investigate care algorithm implementation.In this paper, we focus primarily on CareTech’s staffing prac-tices. CareTech uses metrics and algorithms, along with human management, to staff shifts. Staffing algorithms have a role at two main sites: as initial schedules were made and when other care-givers called off their shifts. When caregivers are scheduled during their onboarding, staff members at CareTech use algorithmic recommendation systems to match caregivers with care recipients. Evaluation metrics (i.e., timeliness, consistency, application usage,and call-offs), along with other data (e.g., caregiver commute time,number of complaints) are used to match caregivers and care recipients. Coordinators receive weekly surveys about the quality of care provided, and provide responses on a linear scale5. After IRB approval, we recruited participants—technologists (n =14), caregivers (n = 9), and coordinators (n = 7)—through a partnership with CareTech and StayHome for interviews using convenience and purposive sampling [10]. StayHome’s research staff arranged site visit and helped recruit participants. We provided a brief description of the study and a screening questionnaire distributed amongst the caregivers and coordinators over email. This approach provided an opportunity to learn from technologists, caregivers,coordinators who were enthusiastic about sharing their experi-ences with the platform. Table 2 and table 3 provide an overview of participant profiles.(1) Technologists: Technologists consisted of software engi-neers, designers, product managers, and data and opera-tions workers. Software engineers talked about buildingCareTech’s features and the company’s history. Designers Develop CareTech’s front-end user experience for caregivers.Designers, the operations team, and a product manager described how they approached curating the caregiver experi-ence. The data scientists, data analysts, and data stewards dis-cussed the metrics used to measure caregiver performance,the data that staffing algorithms use, and how algorithms work in practice.(2) Caregivers: We use the term ‘caregivers’ to refer to the people employed by CareTech to provide care for pay.(3) Coordinators: The term ‘coordinators’ refers to people that pay for CareTech’s services and coordinate their delivery,usually on behalf of an older loved one. Recruiting interview participants through a partnership with Stay-Home and CareTech potentially biased results toward more positive perspectives of organizational practices. Caregivers and coordina-tors with more negative views about the company may have been reluctant to share their opinions or participate in interviews alto-gether due to fears of retaliation from the platform. Convenience Sampling limited the extent to which we were able to understand differences across demographic subgroups. Future work should explore this issue. Further, recruitment overlooked the perspectives of care coordinators and caregivers who have left the platform due to difficulties This study draws on data gathered from one week of observations performed in July 2022 and 30 interviews conducted between May2022 and August 2022. We conducted in-depth interviews to understand the cultural inputs that shape algorithm design and the implications for caregivers and coordinators. Interviews are well-suited for understanding social dimensions of how people interpret the world and take actions based on those interpretations [64]. Interviews with technology workers show how they make sense of their work and build systems [67], and interviews with caregivers and coordinators show that care practices diverge from organizational philosophy [53]. After several interviews, one researcher visitedStayHome’s global headquarters and a company-owned agency,located in a major Midwestern city in the U.S. The researcher toured the company’s offices and met with support staff. In addition, theresearcher engaged these actors in informal conversations to learn how StayHome and CareTech operate. To understand how the plat-form is presented to caregivers and what aspects of paid care work are emphasized, the researcher observed a caregiver training ses-sion on lifting and transferring techniques at one of StayHome’scompany-owned franchises and attended a virtual onboarding ses-sion with CareTech in the afternoon.We developed the interview guide with interest in valuation and evaluation practices as they occur on CareTech’s platform. Treating valuation as a moral outlook, we drew on practice-oriented approaches to understanding how different actors conceptualize and contribute value in labor contexts [36]. Examining the practices of the people that develop platforms and those who are subject to their architecture provides an opportunity to identify the underlying justifications and actions that shape and transform care work as it occurs on the ground. Interview questions thus sought to elicit interviewees' daily practices, what elements of their work they described as most important, the least favorite aspects of their work,and their ideological orientation towards the concept of ‘care.’After obtaining consent, we recorded the interviews, which lasted between 45 and 90 minutes and took place mainly over Zoom. However, we did interview several caregivers and one coordinator in person. Team members iteratively refined these themes through discussion and mapped them to the EoW framework. We used a third-party qualitative coding tool (NVivo) to complete the coding process. To make theoretical sense of the data, we returned to the literature and iterated between data and extant research. Our findings indicate that technologists drew on several economies of worth—which we refer to as moral frameworks—to navigate the seemingly irreconcilable demands of home care. They referenced multiple interpretations of the term ‘care’ to resolve contradictions.We illustrate this point by first focusing on how technologists described the problems that they claim to solve. Then, we analyze the nature of the solutions they presented, highlighting how technolo-gists imbued different aspects of algorithm design and function with moral meanings. This finding demonstrates the interpretive flexibil-ity of technological artifacts. Finally, we turn to the perspectives of caregivers and coordinators. Their accounts show how algorithmic staffing practices created new forms of uncertainty—the mirror of technologists' stated intentions.4.1 Navigating Contextual ComplexityTechnologists drew on multiple moral frameworks to navigate expectations and demands, appealing to various interpretations of care’ to reconcile the contradictory pressures they face. The technologists we interviewed framed CareTech as a platform developed to address traditional home care agencies’ logistical and opera-tional challenges. In this context, they appealed to an industrial moral framework, framing their work as introducing greater levels of efficiency and rationalization to the home care industry. How-ever, many of the technologists we interviewed also framed their work in terms of a civic moral framework, critiquing prior staffing practices as subjective, opaque, unfair, and harmful to the material well-being of caregivers. Although these two narratives may appear contradictory, technologists unified these demands by appealing to the societal need for more care. For example, improvements inefficiency were discussed in terms of increasing the affordability of care while improving working conditions was imagined as growing the size of the caregiving workforce. We argue that technologists navigate complexity when creating and developing care algorithms by strategically appealing to justifications corresponding to differ-ent moral frameworks, drawing on multiple interpretations of a single term to move between them. Throughout this section, we draw attention to how technologists position algorithmic staffing practices as one solution to the problems they described.4.1.1 Platform Description & Motivations. The rhetoric that tech-nologists and company executives used to describe their motivation for building the platform appealed to domestic and social goods. In press releases and on the company website, CareTech’s execu-tives described their frustrations in searching for care for their own parents. Similarly, technologists invoked ideas of familial respon-sibility, relaying stories about their difficulties in finding care for aging parents. Technologists also drew on more civic-oriented no-tions of good, framing their work with reference to positive social change. For example, Richard described, “being part of something that can have a positive impact on society.” The company’s mission statement, was described as ‘improving care in society6, highlight-ing the significance of a single moral concept in technologists discourse.In discussing the company’s strategy, the technologists we in-terviewed described CareTech as a “platform,” “communication company,” or “logistical engine,”, foregrounding CareTech’s use of digital technology to improve efficiency, and framed their work asa response to logistical challenges in the home care industry. Aiden described what he framed as the company’s main value proposition:I think the big sort of sell is, it is getting harder and harder to operate care. I think it is getting more expensive...the core value proposition is where we are trying to figure out how to build a platform around doing this, and helping agencies focus more on their relationships with their communities and customers.He elaborated that, by centralizing operations, CareTech offers partner agencies relief from work that is “consuming and grueling,whether it’s paperwork, management, documentation, staffing, lo-gistics, or being on call all the time.” By filling this role, CareTech‘frees up agencies to both source customers and maintain that rela-tionship and kind of connection’ (Aiden). Repeated references to the relationship between CareTech and the agencies with which it partners serve two purposes. First, they identify areas whereCareTech uses technology to increase efficiency in the home care industry. This problem formulation provides the background for how organizational solutions are framed. Second, they format a division of labor. In this account, partner agencies are positioned as responsible for managing relationships in local markets, while the platform oversees aspects of labor control and management.Here, technologists frame the platform’s work in industrial terms and partner agencies in domestic terms. 4.1.2 Staffing Practices as Solutions. As they justified their work,technologists also blended elements from multiple moral frame-works. Specifically, they simultaneously appealed to notions of market dominance and civic responsibility. This overlap materialized as Robert, a data scientist, stated that the company’s scale offered a ‘unified view across markets’ and provided access to a sufficient amount of data to use statistical techniques to ‘learn from the data to provide better home care’, serving as a “competitive dif-ferentiator in the market.” In addition, Floyd framed the company's size as affording more ‘careful’ staffing practice:From a systemic perspective, when you are bigger you have these systems in place, and you do not have to guilt somebody into working a shift. If you need a shift filled, you have a stable of hundreds of caregivers you can reach out to, it is just a matter of how much bonus you have to put on it.These rhetorical strategies demonstrate how technologists draw on multiple moral frameworks to present their work as solutions to different problems.Building on discussions of CareTech’s organizational strategy,technologists most concretely articulated their efforts toward ‘im-proving care in society’ through labor management. They started these discussions by problematizing caregiver job quality under legacy home care practices as associated with low wages, few ben-efits, rigid scheduling practices, and little recognition of caregivers efforts. Kennedy critiqued legacy staffing practices on the grounds of fairness and transparency:There’s a lot of favoritism that happens. There’s a lack of transparency. And so as you can imagine, the caregivers who work the most shifts, they’re able to earn the most amount of money. And that’s really helping to improve their lives and livelihoods. Other technologists framed algorithmic staffing as a solution to the legacy staffing practices that Kennedy identified as opaque and unfair. While Kennedy incorporated concerns about material well-being into her critiques, other technologists generally avoided discussing their efforts toward increasing caregiver job quality in terms of a market-based moral framework. This may have resulted from the market constraints of care, where the price for private pay home care is inaccessible for many families. Aria explainedthat raising wages for caregivers would make the price of care“unpayable” by many clients. 4.1.3 Professionalizing Care. Instead, technologists framed their efforts as attempts to improve caregivers’ status and provide them with a career. Aria noted that improving the collective status of caregivers was part of CareTech’s mission since its founding, em-phasizing challenging aspects of the job:I think that a really big piece of what CareTech is try-ing to do and has been trying to do since the beginning you know, elevate the profession of caregiving. Andtruly treat it a profession instead of just a job...because it's a difficult, emotionally intense, sometimes physi-cally intense thing to do.Floyd described further aspirations to elevate caregivers’ status through professionalization:I would say that [career] is a north star for us. I think everyone views that as an innovation that we can and should make, and the profession is worth it... we're working towards it, but we haven’t actually gotten there yet.These discussions highlight the links that technologists establish between different moral frameworks as they respond to a complex set of challenges. While they expressed concern about the value that care holds in society, increasing the pecuniary value of car was viewed as infeasible. Technologists responded to this problem by appealing to the status of the profession.

Contrary to technologists’ aspirations touse algorithms to build a fairer, more transparent order, algorithmic staffing practices in fact created new conditions of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. First, we focus on evaluation practices.CareTech’s app for caregivers displays ratings across several met-rics related to operational aspects of care delivery (i.e., timeliness,consistency, application usage, and call-offs).

As a new caregiver on the platform,Hazel worried about a low client consistency rating and discussed needing to take the initiative to understand why she received low ratings across other metrics. Puzzled about low application usage ratings, Hazel described needing to reach out to CareTech to understand “what [she] was missing.” CareTech’s communication and evaluation practices created unclear situations with multiple interpretations and required additional labor on the part of caregivers to understand how care recipients experienced their care and how the platform judged their performance. Coordinators, on the other hand, discussed their own evaluation practices as infused with ambivalence—a finding that we found surprising given the intimate and impactful context of care for an older loved one. While coordinators described clear feelings about the care provided to loved ones, our interviewees responded to CareTech’s evaluation surveys inconsistently. Coordinators expressed satisfaction with the care that caregivers provided and thus did not feel a need to fill out the company’s weekly care-giver evaluation survey, described how these surveys were not as useful compared to in-person evaluations performed over more extended periods, or expressed that they did not feel their feedback through these outlets was listened to by CareTech. Phyllis—who lives with her care recipient—described that since the quality of care was so consistent, there was not a need to be very detailed in her evaluations: “they will send out those [surveys] weekly...soyou click on attentiveness, preparation, and I don’t remember what they all are. There’s about five of them. I don’t get very detailed.” On The other hand, Brooks—who did not live with his care recipient,and was dissatisfied with the consistency of staffing provided byCareTech—described feeling overwhelmed by the amount of eval-uating he was asked to do: “For each one of the caregivers that has been in, they’re asking for an opinion for eight to 10 caregivers everyMonday, on the same thing, the same people doing the same thing.I’ve had a hard time seeing the value on a weekly basis.” He saw more value in evaluations carried out over longer intervals as it had been before the acquisition. There used to be the quarterly report where they would actually go in and visit and come back and say,‘this has changed, or this looks like it’s changed’...when someone steps in four or five times a year those are the ones that can pick out some things.Opal, who uses CareTech to provide care to her husband, discussed her attitude towards the surveys: “Honestly, I ignore [the surveys]. It’s not something I want to do. I don’t know why. I know they're doing great.” These perspectives demonstrate a difference in the worth actors ascribed to particular evaluation practices, high-lighting a mismatch between technologists’, coordinators’, and care-givers’ perspectives. Other coordinators described non-use of CareTech’s evaluation infrastructure, even when there were striking departures from care expectations. Coordinators justified their approach by appealing to different moral frameworks. Riley said, “what did happen onetime, and I should probably be more tuned into it...there was one day when one of the caregivers didn’t show up at all. And I didn't know about it until the next day.” She justified the non-use through appeals to a domestic moral framework: “I’m not as hands-on, I’mnot looking at the app to see what they’re doing. I get my feedback on how they’re doing from my mom and dad.” Winnie, who relied on a caregiver to transport her mother to church on Sunday mornings, described situations where sometimes a caregiver assigned to the shift couldn’t drive or had no car. Even so, she did not fill out regular surveys, drawing on her experience as a business owner (industrial)to express that she understood the challenges of staffing shifts: “it’sa very hard thing to maneuver in the world that we’re walking in. We Own a small business. We employ 13 ladies, so I understand.” At the same time, she seemed to negatively moralize non-use: “I will be honest with you that a survey has come...I haven’t filled it out. So I Haven't done due diligence on my part. You know, so I’m going to own that part.” While some coordinators expressed frustration about consistency, communication, quality, and the efficacy of evaluation practices, they appealed to multiple moral frameworks to justify different uses of evaluation infrastructure.4.3.2 Work Practices and Professional Boundaries. Continued dis-cussion with caregivers provided insight into how the problems that technologists faced contributed to aspects of platform design.The need to fill open shifts and coordinate care work across multiple individuals—associated with an industrial moral framework—took precedence over other concerns. Francine’s account of interactions with CareTech provides an example of how the need to staff shifts devalued communication about performance: “they have never given me any feedback or evaluation, the only time they call is about the schedule, asking if you can work more.” We argue that technologists prioritization of needs associated with the industrial moral frame-work eroded the boundary between caregivers’ work and personal lives and changed care practices.For example, the platform uses a notification system to bring open shifts to caregivers’ attention. However, Pepper describe how the constant notification stream makes it difficult for her to differentiate between work and leisure time:I can tell they have a lot of shifts to fill in. Am I go-ing to be under pressure? They’ve asked me for five things, and you said no to all of them, it feels likeI should say yes to something now. It’s just a little harder to be either working or not working...when you see your phone in the morning and you see all those notifications there.Hayden described receiving “30 to 40” notifications a day from the app, even after reaching out to CareTech to express that they would not work any more shifts. Further, they described confu-sion and frustration regarding the processes by which shifts were initially assigned:I actually said no to [the shift], but they scheduled me anyway. Which was how I got a lot of my shifts,which was okay...I know sometimes it sounds weird,but I would say no to a shift, maybe they’d think thatI said yes.This account suggests that the platform does not allow for as much flexibility as technologists imagine.In contrast to legacy record-keeping procedures, where care-givers left paper-based care notes in clients’ homes, CareTech’splatform requires that caregivers describe their shifts upon clock-ing out in an electronic journal that is viewable by coordinators and other caregivers. While caregivers described that the journal helped them feel more prepared for each shift, they also described reading journal entries outside of working hours, which provided further evidence for blurred boundaries between work and personal life.For example, Chauncey described reading entries “at night, before Igo to bed, I start reading if I’m going to work the next morning.” In Addition, platform architecture requiring caregivers to complete these logs changed caregivers’ relationship to time spent on the job. Francine described how filling out the notes, especially in the time-sensitive context of a shift, placed pressure on how she spent time providing care: “if you clock out right at a minute after [your shift ends] they get you on that.” Efforts to avoid disciplinary action created new relationships to time: “I just always try to clock out a few minutes before because you get all these questions before closing out the app” (Francine). In these cases, platform architecture changed caregivers' relationships with their time both on and off the clock,which put caregivers under additional pressure.We found that aspects of platform and algorithm design create new forms of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. We argue that this results from a mismatch between technologists’ moral reasoning and that of other platform actors. In addition, the need to fill open shifts and coordinate work across many individuals pri-oritizes a logic of efficiency over concerns for caregiver job quality.Despite coordinators’ unmet expectations and new pressures that the platform placed on caregivers, both sets of actors maintain a commitment to the platform. A possible explanation for contin-ued attachment is the moral significance of ‘care.’ While the term carries various meanings across actors and situations, it may act as a resource that maintains a particular status quo by mitigating organized critique of or departure from the platform.

25,Ambivalence,Perceived_Problem,"The subject of our case study, CareTech4, is one of several start-upsthat are credited with “reinventing the [home care] agency model”[22]. Prior to data collection, CareTech acquired StayHome, a traditional home care agency franchise. To contextualize our findings,we briefly discuss CareTech’s business model.CareTech partners with traditional home care agencies to support back-end administrative, legal, compliance, and logistics functions in exchange for a share of partner agencies’ revenue, employing caregivers directly. Caregivers assist with activities of daily living(i.e., bathing, dressing, getting in or out of a bed or chair, walking,using the toilet, eating) [43], and instrumental activities of daily living (i.e., cooking, cleaning, transportation, laundry, managing finances) [46]. CareTech’s use of algorithms to match caregivers to care recipients is central to our case. When we started data collection, CareTech’s technology platform had recently been im-plemented at StayHome’s company-owned agencies, providing a unique opportunity to investigate care algorithm implementation.In this paper, we focus primarily on CareTech’s staffing prac-tices. CareTech uses metrics and algorithms, along with human management, to staff shifts. Staffing algorithms have a role at two main sites: as initial schedules were made and when other care-givers called off their shifts. When caregivers are scheduled during their onboarding, staff members at CareTech use algorithmic recommendation systems to match caregivers with care recipients. Evaluation metrics (i.e., timeliness, consistency, application usage,and call-offs), along with other data (e.g., caregiver commute time,number of complaints) are used to match caregivers and care recipients. Coordinators receive weekly surveys about the quality of care provided, and provide responses on a linear scale5. After IRB approval, we recruited participants—technologists (n =14), caregivers (n = 9), and coordinators (n = 7)—through a partnership with CareTech and StayHome for interviews using convenience and purposive sampling [10]. StayHome’s research staff arranged site visit and helped recruit participants. We provided a brief description of the study and a screening questionnaire distributed amongst the caregivers and coordinators over email. This approach provided an opportunity to learn from technologists, caregivers,coordinators who were enthusiastic about sharing their experi-ences with the platform. Table 2 and table 3 provide an overview of participant profiles.(1) Technologists: Technologists consisted of software engi-neers, designers, product managers, and data and opera-tions workers. Software engineers talked about buildingCareTech’s features and the company’s history. Designers Develop CareTech’s front-end user experience for caregivers.Designers, the operations team, and a product manager described how they approached curating the caregiver experi-ence. The data scientists, data analysts, and data stewards dis-cussed the metrics used to measure caregiver performance,the data that staffing algorithms use, and how algorithms work in practice.(2) Caregivers: We use the term ‘caregivers’ to refer to the people employed by CareTech to provide care for pay.(3) Coordinators: The term ‘coordinators’ refers to people that pay for CareTech’s services and coordinate their delivery,usually on behalf of an older loved one. Recruiting interview participants through a partnership with Stay-Home and CareTech potentially biased results toward more positive perspectives of organizational practices. Caregivers and coordina-tors with more negative views about the company may have been reluctant to share their opinions or participate in interviews alto-gether due to fears of retaliation from the platform. Convenience Sampling limited the extent to which we were able to understand differences across demographic subgroups. Future work should explore this issue. Further, recruitment overlooked the perspectives of care coordinators and caregivers who have left the platform due to difficulties This study draws on data gathered from one week of observations performed in July 2022 and 30 interviews conducted between May2022 and August 2022. We conducted in-depth interviews to understand the cultural inputs that shape algorithm design and the implications for caregivers and coordinators. Interviews are well-suited for understanding social dimensions of how people interpret the world and take actions based on those interpretations [64]. Interviews with technology workers show how they make sense of their work and build systems [67], and interviews with caregivers and coordinators show that care practices diverge from organizational philosophy [53]. After several interviews, one researcher visitedStayHome’s global headquarters and a company-owned agency,located in a major Midwestern city in the U.S. The researcher toured the company’s offices and met with support staff. In addition, theresearcher engaged these actors in informal conversations to learn how StayHome and CareTech operate. To understand how the plat-form is presented to caregivers and what aspects of paid care work are emphasized, the researcher observed a caregiver training ses-sion on lifting and transferring techniques at one of StayHome’scompany-owned franchises and attended a virtual onboarding ses-sion with CareTech in the afternoon.We developed the interview guide with interest in valuation and evaluation practices as they occur on CareTech’s platform. Treating valuation as a moral outlook, we drew on practice-oriented approaches to understanding how different actors conceptualize and contribute value in labor contexts [36]. Examining the practices of the people that develop platforms and those who are subject to their architecture provides an opportunity to identify the underlying justifications and actions that shape and transform care work as it occurs on the ground. Interview questions thus sought to elicit interviewees' daily practices, what elements of their work they described as most important, the least favorite aspects of their work,and their ideological orientation towards the concept of ‘care.’After obtaining consent, we recorded the interviews, which lasted between 45 and 90 minutes and took place mainly over Zoom. However, we did interview several caregivers and one coordinator in person. Team members iteratively refined these themes through discussion and mapped them to the EoW framework. We used a third-party qualitative coding tool (NVivo) to complete the coding process. To make theoretical sense of the data, we returned to the literature and iterated between data and extant research. Our findings indicate that technologists drew on several economies of worth—which we refer to as moral frameworks—to navigate the seemingly irreconcilable demands of home care. They referenced multiple interpretations of the term ‘care’ to resolve contradictions.We illustrate this point by first focusing on how technologists described the problems that they claim to solve. Then, we analyze the nature of the solutions they presented, highlighting how technolo-gists imbued different aspects of algorithm design and function with moral meanings. This finding demonstrates the interpretive flexibil-ity of technological artifacts. Finally, we turn to the perspectives of caregivers and coordinators. Their accounts show how algorithmic staffing practices created new forms of uncertainty—the mirror of technologists' stated intentions.4.1 Navigating Contextual ComplexityTechnologists drew on multiple moral frameworks to navigate expectations and demands, appealing to various interpretations of care’ to reconcile the contradictory pressures they face. The technologists we interviewed framed CareTech as a platform developed to address traditional home care agencies’ logistical and opera-tional challenges. In this context, they appealed to an industrial moral framework, framing their work as introducing greater levels of efficiency and rationalization to the home care industry. How-ever, many of the technologists we interviewed also framed their work in terms of a civic moral framework, critiquing prior staffing practices as subjective, opaque, unfair, and harmful to the material well-being of caregivers. Although these two narratives may appear contradictory, technologists unified these demands by appealing to the societal need for more care. For example, improvements inefficiency were discussed in terms of increasing the affordability of care while improving working conditions was imagined as growing the size of the caregiving workforce. We argue that technologists navigate complexity when creating and developing care algorithms by strategically appealing to justifications corresponding to differ-ent moral frameworks, drawing on multiple interpretations of a single term to move between them. Throughout this section, we draw attention to how technologists position algorithmic staffing practices as one solution to the problems they described.4.1.1 Platform Description & Motivations. The rhetoric that tech-nologists and company executives used to describe their motivation for building the platform appealed to domestic and social goods. In press releases and on the company website, CareTech’s execu-tives described their frustrations in searching for care for their own parents. Similarly, technologists invoked ideas of familial respon-sibility, relaying stories about their difficulties in finding care for aging parents. Technologists also drew on more civic-oriented no-tions of good, framing their work with reference to positive social change. For example, Richard described, “being part of something that can have a positive impact on society.” The company’s mission statement, was described as ‘improving care in society6, highlight-ing the significance of a single moral concept in technologists discourse.In discussing the company’s strategy, the technologists we in-terviewed described CareTech as a “platform,” “communication company,” or “logistical engine,”, foregrounding CareTech’s use of digital technology to improve efficiency, and framed their work asa response to logistical challenges in the home care industry. Aiden described what he framed as the company’s main value proposition:I think the big sort of sell is, it is getting harder and harder to operate care. I think it is getting more expensive...the core value proposition is where we are trying to figure out how to build a platform around doing this, and helping agencies focus more on their relationships with their communities and customers.He elaborated that, by centralizing operations, CareTech offers partner agencies relief from work that is “consuming and grueling,whether it’s paperwork, management, documentation, staffing, lo-gistics, or being on call all the time.” By filling this role, CareTech‘frees up agencies to both source customers and maintain that rela-tionship and kind of connection’ (Aiden). Repeated references to the relationship between CareTech and the agencies with which it partners serve two purposes. First, they identify areas whereCareTech uses technology to increase efficiency in the home care industry. This problem formulation provides the background for how organizational solutions are framed. Second, they format a division of labor. In this account, partner agencies are positioned as responsible for managing relationships in local markets, while the platform oversees aspects of labor control and management.Here, technologists frame the platform’s work in industrial terms and partner agencies in domestic terms. 4.1.2 Staffing Practices as Solutions. As they justified their work,technologists also blended elements from multiple moral frame-works. Specifically, they simultaneously appealed to notions of market dominance and civic responsibility. This overlap materialized as Robert, a data scientist, stated that the company’s scale offered a ‘unified view across markets’ and provided access to a sufficient amount of data to use statistical techniques to ‘learn from the data to provide better home care’, serving as a “competitive dif-ferentiator in the market.” In addition, Floyd framed the company's size as affording more ‘careful’ staffing practice:From a systemic perspective, when you are bigger you have these systems in place, and you do not have to guilt somebody into working a shift. If you need a shift filled, you have a stable of hundreds of caregivers you can reach out to, it is just a matter of how much bonus you have to put on it.These rhetorical strategies demonstrate how technologists draw on multiple moral frameworks to present their work as solutions to different problems.Building on discussions of CareTech’s organizational strategy,technologists most concretely articulated their efforts toward ‘im-proving care in society’ through labor management. They started these discussions by problematizing caregiver job quality under legacy home care practices as associated with low wages, few ben-efits, rigid scheduling practices, and little recognition of caregivers efforts. Kennedy critiqued legacy staffing practices on the grounds of fairness and transparency:There’s a lot of favoritism that happens. There’s a lack of transparency. And so as you can imagine, the caregivers who work the most shifts, they’re able to earn the most amount of money. And that’s really helping to improve their lives and livelihoods. Other technologists framed algorithmic staffing as a solution to the legacy staffing practices that Kennedy identified as opaque and unfair. While Kennedy incorporated concerns about material well-being into her critiques, other technologists generally avoided discussing their efforts toward increasing caregiver job quality in terms of a market-based moral framework. This may have resulted from the market constraints of care, where the price for private pay home care is inaccessible for many families. Aria explainedthat raising wages for caregivers would make the price of care“unpayable” by many clients. 4.1.3 Professionalizing Care. Instead, technologists framed their efforts as attempts to improve caregivers’ status and provide them with a career. Aria noted that improving the collective status of caregivers was part of CareTech’s mission since its founding, em-phasizing challenging aspects of the job:I think that a really big piece of what CareTech is try-ing to do and has been trying to do since the beginning you know, elevate the profession of caregiving. Andtruly treat it a profession instead of just a job...because it's a difficult, emotionally intense, sometimes physi-cally intense thing to do.Floyd described further aspirations to elevate caregivers’ status through professionalization:I would say that [career] is a north star for us. I think everyone views that as an innovation that we can and should make, and the profession is worth it... we're working towards it, but we haven’t actually gotten there yet.These discussions highlight the links that technologists establish between different moral frameworks as they respond to a complex set of challenges. While they expressed concern about the value that care holds in society, increasing the pecuniary value of car was viewed as infeasible. Technologists responded to this problem by appealing to the status of the profession. However, technologists most defined solutions came in the form of staffing algorithms.4.2 Datafying CareWe unpack staffing practices at CareTech, which we argue are emblematic of technological solutionism. Our analysis reveals that technologists associated different aspects of staffing algorithms with different moral frameworks. We argue that how decisions are made about who is best suited for particular shifts—and why—is changing with the advent and implementation of algorithmic staffing tools as technologists prioritize efficiency. However, discussions with technologists show that there are tensions present in the use of algorithms. On the one hand, technologists discussed their work in terms of trying to increase caregiver performance. Performance Evaluation metrics break care into a set of constituent elements closely aligned with operational efficiency (an appeal to the indus-trial moral framework). On the other hand, technologists described their work as oriented toward establishing long-term relationships between caregivers and care recipients (an appeal to the domestic moral framework).The metrics and measurements that support algorithmic staffing practices are most closely associated with notions of productivity and operational efficiency. Technologists presented one part of their work as oriented toward increasing the “performance, or perceived performance of the caregiver” (Floyd). They described how this work is accomplished by measuring: (1) timeliness (how frequently a caregiver arrives to a shift on time); (2) consistency (adherence to schedule shifts); (3) application usage (whether or not the caregiver uses the application to clock in to and out of shifts and evaluate care recipient well-being); and (4) call-offs (shifts not released seven days in advance). While this evaluation practice makes care legible based on a discrete set of metrics, the composition of these metrics is oriented toward operational efficiency rather than the experiences of care recipients or care coordinators.Technologists contrasted their work with platforms in the ride-hailing industry7, describing how their work was motivated by the desire to establish long-term relationships between caregivers and care recipients. They referenced algorithms in terms that framed care as a holistic practice, often comparing the product of their work to other intimate relationships. Staffing algorithms have a role at two main sites: as initial schedules were made and when other caregivers called off their shifts. When caregivers are scheduled during their onboarding, staff members at CareTech use algorithmic recommendation systems to match caregivers with care recipients.In both cases, platform architects compared the matching process to other intimate relations between caregivers and care recipients.In Sandra’s words: Once the data are all collected, [the algorithm] gives us a list of caregivers, and it was ranked by most likely to be picked up by the caregiver...there is a...I don't want to say negotiating, but there are conversations that go back and forth. Because it does become an arranged marriage when you’re putting it inside thehome.In instances where shifts opened up with clients, the platform gives caregivers the option to pick up shifts with these clients through a user interface that Floyd described as “not not tinder 8 inspired. In advancing these relationship-based arguments, technologists define quality care by referencing domestic relationships between caregivers and care recipients.On the one hand, technologists seek to build a platform that effi-ciently delivers consistent care to a growing number of older adult care recipients. On the other, they describe their work as motivated by a desire to optimize relationships between caregivers and care recipients. At the same time, they framed their efforts as improving fairness, accountability, and transparency in staffing practices. Pair-ing discussions of metrics—which break care down into constituent elements associated with industrial efficiency—with algorithms staffing practices—which technologists use to frame evaluation in domestic terms—reveals that these actors associate different parts of their job with distinct moral frameworks to meet a complex set of demands. Further, interviews with caregivers and coordinators reveal that these performance evaluation criteria and platform staffing practices are a source of tension and stress.4.3 Platform AsymmetriesWhat are the consequences of technologists’ actions? To answer this question, we turn to platform caregivers’ and care coordinators’ per-spectives and experiences. Contrary to technologists’ aspirations touse algorithms to build a fairer, more transparent order, algorithmic staffing practices in fact created new conditions of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. First, we focus on evaluation practices.CareTech’s app for caregivers displays ratings across several met-rics related to operational aspects of care delivery (i.e., timeliness,consistency, application usage, and call-offs). The platform also sends weekly caregiver evaluation surveys to coordinators but does not share this feedback directly with caregivers. Further, caregivers rarely received qualitative feedback regarding the quality of care they provided. Caregivers discussed how these aspects of platform design contributed to ambiguity regarding insight into their perfor-mance, while coordinators approached completing survey-based caregiver evaluations with ambivalence. Second, we analyze care-givers’ interactions with CareTech’s staffing practices. Caregivers described experiencing collapsed boundaries between working and personal time. Despite these new challenges, the caregivers and coordinators we interviewed did not mention a desire to leave. .4.3.1 Ambiguity and Ambivalence. While caregivers described providing care as meaningful and were generally content with the conditions they faced on the platform, they discussed a lack of clarity regarding expectations and performance. As Hayden said:I believe that the clients, they also rate us after every shift. So then if we get rated lowly every time or pretty consistently, I’m sure they will reach out tous...I don’t know that it helps us rate our care and how well we’re doing with our clients, but I don't know how else they could do that...you hear stories of people who are dissatisfied with their care, and that's hard to tell.It was only after connecting with other caregivers that Hayden Learned that it was possible to request a performance evaluation form CareTech. Further, the opacity of metrics created feelings of worry for care-givers about their performance. As a new caregiver on the platform,Hazel worried about a low client consistency rating and discussed needing to take the initiative to understand why she received low ratings across other metrics. Puzzled about low application usage ratings, Hazel described needing to reach out to CareTech to understand “what [she] was missing.” CareTech’s communication and evaluation practices created unclear situations with multiple interpretations and required additional labor on the part of caregivers to understand how care recipients experienced their care and how the platform judged their performance. Coordinators, on the other hand, discussed their own evaluation practices as infused with ambivalence—a finding that we found surprising given the intimate and impactful context of care for an older loved one. While coordinators described clear feelings about the care provided to loved ones, our interviewees responded to CareTech’s evaluation surveys inconsistently. Coordinators expressed satisfaction with the care that caregivers provided and thus did not feel a need to fill out the company’s weekly care-giver evaluation survey, described how these surveys were not as useful compared to in-person evaluations performed over more extended periods, or expressed that they did not feel their feedback through these outlets was listened to by CareTech. Phyllis—who lives with her care recipient—described that since the quality of care was so consistent, there was not a need to be very detailed in her evaluations: “they will send out those [surveys] weekly...soyou click on attentiveness, preparation, and I don’t remember what they all are. There’s about five of them. I don’t get very detailed.” On The other hand, Brooks—who did not live with his care recipient,and was dissatisfied with the consistency of staffing provided byCareTech—described feeling overwhelmed by the amount of eval-uating he was asked to do: “For each one of the caregivers that has been in, they’re asking for an opinion for eight to 10 caregivers everyMonday, on the same thing, the same people doing the same thing.I’ve had a hard time seeing the value on a weekly basis.” He saw more value in evaluations carried out over longer intervals as it had been before the acquisition. There used to be the quarterly report where they would actually go in and visit and come back and say,‘this has changed, or this looks like it’s changed’...when someone steps in four or five times a year those are the ones that can pick out some things.Opal, who uses CareTech to provide care to her husband, discussed her attitude towards the surveys: “Honestly, I ignore [the surveys]. It’s not something I want to do. I don’t know why. I know they're doing great.” These perspectives demonstrate a difference in the worth actors ascribed to particular evaluation practices, high-lighting a mismatch between technologists’, coordinators’, and care-givers’ perspectives. Other coordinators described non-use of CareTech’s evaluation infrastructure, even when there were striking departures from care expectations. Coordinators justified their approach by appealing to different moral frameworks. Riley said, “what did happen onetime, and I should probably be more tuned into it...there was one day when one of the caregivers didn’t show up at all. And I didn't know about it until the next day.” She justified the non-use through appeals to a domestic moral framework: “I’m not as hands-on, I’mnot looking at the app to see what they’re doing. I get my feedback on how they’re doing from my mom and dad.” Winnie, who relied on a caregiver to transport her mother to church on Sunday mornings, described situations where sometimes a caregiver assigned to the shift couldn’t drive or had no car. Even so, she did not fill out regular surveys, drawing on her experience as a business owner (industrial)to express that she understood the challenges of staffing shifts: “it’sa very hard thing to maneuver in the world that we’re walking in. We Own a small business. We employ 13 ladies, so I understand.” At the same time, she seemed to negatively moralize non-use: “I will be honest with you that a survey has come...I haven’t filled it out. So I Haven't done due diligence on my part. You know, so I’m going to own that part.” While some coordinators expressed frustration about consistency, communication, quality, and the efficacy of evaluation practices, they appealed to multiple moral frameworks to justify different uses of evaluation infrastructure.4.3.2 Work Practices and Professional Boundaries. Continued dis-cussion with caregivers provided insight into how the problems that technologists faced contributed to aspects of platform design.The need to fill open shifts and coordinate care work across multiple individuals—associated with an industrial moral framework—took precedence over other concerns. Francine’s account of interactions with CareTech provides an example of how the need to staff shifts devalued communication about performance: “they have never given me any feedback or evaluation, the only time they call is about the schedule, asking if you can work more.” We argue that technologists prioritization of needs associated with the industrial moral frame-work eroded the boundary between caregivers’ work and personal lives and changed care practices.For example, the platform uses a notification system to bring open shifts to caregivers’ attention. However, Pepper describe how the constant notification stream makes it difficult for her to differentiate between work and leisure time:I can tell they have a lot of shifts to fill in. Am I go-ing to be under pressure? They’ve asked me for five things, and you said no to all of them, it feels likeI should say yes to something now. It’s just a little harder to be either working or not working...when you see your phone in the morning and you see all those notifications there.Hayden described receiving “30 to 40” notifications a day from the app, even after reaching out to CareTech to express that they would not work any more shifts. Further, they described confu-sion and frustration regarding the processes by which shifts were initially assigned:I actually said no to [the shift], but they scheduled me anyway. Which was how I got a lot of my shifts,which was okay...I know sometimes it sounds weird,but I would say no to a shift, maybe they’d think thatI said yes.This account suggests that the platform does not allow for as much flexibility as technologists imagine.In contrast to legacy record-keeping procedures, where care-givers left paper-based care notes in clients’ homes, CareTech’splatform requires that caregivers describe their shifts upon clock-ing out in an electronic journal that is viewable by coordinators and other caregivers. While caregivers described that the journal helped them feel more prepared for each shift, they also described reading journal entries outside of working hours, which provided further evidence for blurred boundaries between work and personal life.For example, Chauncey described reading entries “at night, before Igo to bed, I start reading if I’m going to work the next morning.” In Addition, platform architecture requiring caregivers to complete these logs changed caregivers’ relationship to time spent on the job. Francine described how filling out the notes, especially in the time-sensitive context of a shift, placed pressure on how she spent time providing care: “if you clock out right at a minute after [your shift ends] they get you on that.” Efforts to avoid disciplinary action created new relationships to time: “I just always try to clock out a few minutes before because you get all these questions before closing out the app” (Francine). In these cases, platform architecture changed caregivers' relationships with their time both on and off the clock,which put caregivers under additional pressure.We found that aspects of platform and algorithm design create new forms of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators.

To contextualize our findings,we briefly discuss CareTech’s business model.CareTech partners with traditional home care agencies to support back-end administrative, legal, compliance, and logistics functions in exchange for a share of partner agencies’ revenue, employing caregivers directly. Caregivers assist with activities of daily living(i.e., bathing, dressing, getting in or out of a bed or chair, walking,using the toilet, eating) [43], and instrumental activities of daily living (i.e., cooking, cleaning, transportation, laundry, managing finances) [46]. CareTech’s use of algorithms to match caregivers to care recipients is central to our case. When we started data collection, CareTech’s technology platform had recently been im-plemented at StayHome’s company-owned agencies, providing a unique opportunity to investigate care algorithm implementation.In this paper, we focus primarily on CareTech’s staffing prac-tices. CareTech uses metrics and algorithms, along with human management, to staff shifts. Staffing algorithms have a role at two main sites: as initial schedules were made and when other care-givers called off their shifts. When caregivers are scheduled during their onboarding, staff members at CareTech use algorithmic recommendation systems to match caregivers with care recipients. Evaluation metrics (i.e., timeliness, consistency, application usage,and call-offs), along with other data (e.g., caregiver commute time,number of complaints) are used to match caregivers and care recipients. Coordinators receive weekly surveys about the quality of care provided, and provide responses on a linear scale5. After IRB approval, we recruited participants—technologists (n =14), caregivers (n = 9), and coordinators (n = 7)—through a partnership with CareTech and StayHome for interviews using convenience and purposive sampling [10]. StayHome’s research staff arranged site visit and helped recruit participants. We provided a brief description of the study and a screening questionnaire distributed amongst the caregivers and coordinators over email. This approach provided an opportunity to learn from technologists, caregivers,coordinators who were enthusiastic about sharing their experi-ences with the platform. Table 2 and table 3 provide an overview of participant profiles.(1) Technologists: Technologists consisted of software engi-neers, designers, product managers, and data and opera-tions workers.

Recruiting interview participants through a partnership with Stay-Home and CareTech potentially biased results toward more positive perspectives of organizational practices. Caregivers and coordina-tors with more negative views about the company may have been reluctant to share their opinions or participate in interviews alto-gether due to fears of retaliation from the platform. Convenience Sampling limited the extent to which we were able to understand differences across demographic subgroups. Future work should explore this issue. Further, recruitment overlooked the perspectives of care coordinators and caregivers who have left the platform due to difficulties This study draws on data gathered from one week of observations performed in July 2022 and 30 interviews conducted between May2022 and August 2022. We conducted in-depth interviews to understand the cultural inputs that shape algorithm design and the implications for caregivers and coordinators. Interviews are well-suited for understanding social dimensions of how people interpret the world and take actions based on those interpretations [64]. Interviews with technology workers show how they make sense of their work and build systems [67], and interviews with caregivers and coordinators show that care practices diverge from organizational philosophy [53]. After several interviews, one researcher visitedStayHome’s global headquarters and a company-owned agency,located in a major Midwestern city in the U.S. The researcher toured the company’s offices and met with support staff. In addition, theresearcher engaged these actors in informal conversations to learn how StayHome and CareTech operate. To understand how the plat-form is presented to caregivers and what aspects of paid care work are emphasized, the researcher observed a caregiver training ses-sion on lifting and transferring techniques at one of StayHome’scompany-owned franchises and attended a virtual onboarding ses-sion with CareTech in the afternoon.We developed the interview guide with interest in valuation and evaluation practices as they occur on CareTech’s platform. Treating valuation as a moral outlook, we drew on practice-oriented approaches to understanding how different actors conceptualize and contribute value in labor contexts [36]. Examining the practices of the people that develop platforms and those who are subject to their architecture provides an opportunity to identify the underlying justifications and actions that shape and transform care work as it occurs on the ground. Interview questions thus sought to elicit interviewees' daily practices, what elements of their work they described as most important, the least favorite aspects of their work,and their ideological orientation towards the concept of ‘care.’After obtaining consent, we recorded the interviews, which lasted between 45 and 90 minutes and took place mainly over Zoom. However, we did interview several caregivers and one coordinator in person. Team members iteratively refined these themes through discussion and mapped them to the EoW framework. We used a third-party qualitative coding tool (NVivo) to complete the coding process. To make theoretical sense of the data, we returned to the literature and iterated between data and extant research. Our findings indicate that technologists drew on several economies of worth—which we refer to as moral frameworks—to navigate the seemingly irreconcilable demands of home care. They referenced multiple interpretations of the term ‘care’ to resolve contradictions.We illustrate this point by first focusing on how technologists described the problems that they claim to solve. Then, we analyze the nature of the solutions they presented, highlighting how technolo-gists imbued different aspects of algorithm design and function with moral meanings. This finding demonstrates the interpretive flexibil-ity of technological artifacts. Finally, we turn to the perspectives of caregivers and coordinators. Their accounts show how algorithmic staffing practices created new forms of uncertainty—the mirror of technologists' stated intentions.4.1 Navigating Contextual ComplexityTechnologists drew on multiple moral frameworks to navigate expectations and demands, appealing to various interpretations of care’ to reconcile the contradictory pressures they face. The technologists we interviewed framed CareTech as a platform developed to address traditional home care agencies’ logistical and opera-tional challenges. In this context, they appealed to an industrial moral framework, framing their work as introducing greater levels of efficiency and rationalization to the home care industry. How-ever, many of the technologists we interviewed also framed their work in terms of a civic moral framework, critiquing prior staffing practices as subjective, opaque, unfair, and harmful to the material well-being of caregivers. Although these two narratives may appear contradictory, technologists unified these demands by appealing to the societal need for more care. For example, improvements inefficiency were discussed in terms of increasing the affordability of care while improving working conditions was imagined as growing the size of the caregiving workforce. We argue that technologists navigate complexity when creating and developing care algorithms by strategically appealing to justifications corresponding to differ-ent moral frameworks, drawing on multiple interpretations of a single term to move between them. Throughout this section, we draw attention to how technologists position algorithmic staffing practices as one solution to the problems they described.4.1.1 Platform Description & Motivations. The rhetoric that tech-nologists and company executives used to describe their motivation for building the platform appealed to domestic and social goods. In press releases and on the company website, CareTech’s execu-tives described their frustrations in searching for care for their own parents. Similarly, technologists invoked ideas of familial respon-sibility, relaying stories about their difficulties in finding care for aging parents. Technologists also drew on more civic-oriented no-tions of good, framing their work with reference to positive social change. For example, Richard described, “being part of something that can have a positive impact on society.” The company’s mission statement, was described as ‘improving care in society6, highlight-ing the significance of a single moral concept in technologists discourse.In discussing the company’s strategy, the technologists we in-terviewed described CareTech as a “platform,” “communication company,” or “logistical engine,”, foregrounding CareTech’s use of digital technology to improve efficiency, and framed their work asa response to logistical challenges in the home care industry. Aiden described what he framed as the company’s main value proposition:I think the big sort of sell is, it is getting harder and harder to operate care. I think it is getting more expensive...the core value proposition is where we are trying to figure out how to build a platform around doing this, and helping agencies focus more on their relationships with their communities and customers.He elaborated that, by centralizing operations, CareTech offers partner agencies relief from work that is “consuming and grueling,whether it’s paperwork, management, documentation, staffing, lo-gistics, or being on call all the time.” By filling this role, CareTech‘frees up agencies to both source customers and maintain that rela-tionship and kind of connection’ (Aiden). Repeated references to the relationship between CareTech and the agencies with which it partners serve two purposes. First, they identify areas whereCareTech uses technology to increase efficiency in the home care industry. This problem formulation provides the background for how organizational solutions are framed. Second, they format a division of labor. In this account, partner agencies are positioned as responsible for managing relationships in local markets, while the platform oversees aspects of labor control and management.Here, technologists frame the platform’s work in industrial terms and partner agencies in domestic terms. 4.1.2 Staffing Practices as Solutions. As they justified their work,technologists also blended elements from multiple moral frame-works. Specifically, they simultaneously appealed to notions of market dominance and civic responsibility. This overlap materialized as Robert, a data scientist, stated that the company’s scale offered a ‘unified view across markets’ and provided access to a sufficient amount of data to use statistical techniques to ‘learn from the data to provide better home care’, serving as a “competitive dif-ferentiator in the market.” In addition, Floyd framed the company's size as affording more ‘careful’ staffing practice:From a systemic perspective, when you are bigger you have these systems in place, and you do not have to guilt somebody into working a shift. If you need a shift filled, you have a stable of hundreds of caregivers you can reach out to, it is just a matter of how much bonus you have to put on it.These rhetorical strategies demonstrate how technologists draw on multiple moral frameworks to present their work as solutions to different problems.Building on discussions of CareTech’s organizational strategy,technologists most concretely articulated their efforts toward ‘im-proving care in society’ through labor management. They started these discussions by problematizing caregiver job quality under legacy home care practices as associated with low wages, few ben-efits, rigid scheduling practices, and little recognition of caregivers efforts. Kennedy critiqued legacy staffing practices on the grounds of fairness and transparency:There’s a lot of favoritism that happens. There’s a lack of transparency. And so as you can imagine, the caregivers who work the most shifts, they’re able to earn the most amount of money. And that’s really helping to improve their lives and livelihoods. Other technologists framed algorithmic staffing as a solution to the legacy staffing practices that Kennedy identified as opaque and unfair. While Kennedy incorporated concerns about material well-being into her critiques, other technologists generally avoided discussing their efforts toward increasing caregiver job quality in terms of a market-based moral framework. This may have resulted from the market constraints of care, where the price for private pay home care is inaccessible for many families. Aria explainedthat raising wages for caregivers would make the price of care“unpayable” by many clients. 4.1.3 Professionalizing Care. Instead, technologists framed their efforts as attempts to improve caregivers’ status and provide them with a career. Aria noted that improving the collective status of caregivers was part of CareTech’s mission since its founding, em-phasizing challenging aspects of the job:I think that a really big piece of what CareTech is try-ing to do and has been trying to do since the beginning you know, elevate the profession of caregiving. Andtruly treat it a profession instead of just a job...because it's a difficult, emotionally intense, sometimes physi-cally intense thing to do.Floyd described further aspirations to elevate caregivers’ status through professionalization:I would say that [career] is a north star for us. I think everyone views that as an innovation that we can and should make, and the profession is worth it... we're working towards it, but we haven’t actually gotten there yet.These discussions highlight the links that technologists establish between different moral frameworks as they respond to a complex set of challenges. While they expressed concern about the value that care holds in society, increasing the pecuniary value of car was viewed as infeasible. Technologists responded to this problem by appealing to the status of the profession. However, technologists most defined solutions came in the form of staffing algorithms.4.2 Datafying CareWe unpack staffing practices at CareTech, which we argue are emblematic of technological solutionism. Our analysis reveals that technologists associated different aspects of staffing algorithms with different moral frameworks. We argue that how decisions are made about who is best suited for particular shifts—and why—is changing with the advent and implementation of algorithmic staffing tools as technologists prioritize efficiency. However, discussions with technologists show that there are tensions present in the use of algorithms. On the one hand, technologists discussed their work in terms of trying to increase caregiver performance. Performance Evaluation metrics break care into a set of constituent elements closely aligned with operational efficiency (an appeal to the indus-trial moral framework). On the other hand, technologists described their work as oriented toward establishing long-term relationships between caregivers and care recipients (an appeal to the domestic moral framework).The metrics and measurements that support algorithmic staffing practices are most closely associated with notions of productivity and operational efficiency. Technologists presented one part of their work as oriented toward increasing the “performance, or perceived performance of the caregiver” (Floyd). They described how this work is accomplished by measuring: (1) timeliness (how frequently a caregiver arrives to a shift on time); (2) consistency (adherence to schedule shifts); (3) application usage (whether or not the caregiver uses the application to clock in to and out of shifts and evaluate care recipient well-being); and (4) call-offs (shifts not released seven days in advance). While this evaluation practice makes care legible based on a discrete set of metrics, the composition of these metrics is oriented toward operational efficiency rather than the experiences of care recipients or care coordinators.Technologists contrasted their work with platforms in the ride-hailing industry7, describing how their work was motivated by the desire to establish long-term relationships between caregivers and care recipients. They referenced algorithms in terms that framed care as a holistic practice, often comparing the product of their work to other intimate relationships. Staffing algorithms have a role at two main sites: as initial schedules were made and when other caregivers called off their shifts. When caregivers are scheduled during their onboarding, staff members at CareTech use algorithmic recommendation systems to match caregivers with care recipients.In both cases, platform architects compared the matching process to other intimate relations between caregivers and care recipients.In Sandra’s words: Once the data are all collected, [the algorithm] gives us a list of caregivers, and it was ranked by most likely to be picked up by the caregiver...there is a...I don't want to say negotiating, but there are conversations that go back and forth. Because it does become an arranged marriage when you’re putting it inside thehome.In instances where shifts opened up with clients, the platform gives caregivers the option to pick up shifts with these clients through a user interface that Floyd described as “not not tinder 8 inspired. In advancing these relationship-based arguments, technologists define quality care by referencing domestic relationships between caregivers and care recipients.On the one hand, technologists seek to build a platform that effi-ciently delivers consistent care to a growing number of older adult care recipients. On the other, they describe their work as motivated by a desire to optimize relationships between caregivers and care recipients. At the same time, they framed their efforts as improving fairness, accountability, and transparency in staffing practices. Pair-ing discussions of metrics—which break care down into constituent elements associated with industrial efficiency—with algorithms staffing practices—which technologists use to frame evaluation in domestic terms—reveals that these actors associate different parts of their job with distinct moral frameworks to meet a complex set of demands. Further, interviews with caregivers and coordinators reveal that these performance evaluation criteria and platform staffing practices are a source of tension and stress.4.3 Platform AsymmetriesWhat are the consequences of technologists’ actions? To answer this question, we turn to platform caregivers’ and care coordinators’ per-spectives and experiences. Contrary to technologists’ aspirations touse algorithms to build a fairer, more transparent order, algorithmic staffing practices in fact created new conditions of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. First, we focus on evaluation practices.CareTech’s app for caregivers displays ratings across several met-rics related to operational aspects of care delivery (i.e., timeliness,consistency, application usage, and call-offs). The platform also sends weekly caregiver evaluation surveys to coordinators but does not share this feedback directly with caregivers. Further, caregivers rarely received qualitative feedback regarding the quality of care they provided. Caregivers discussed how these aspects of platform design contributed to ambiguity regarding insight into their perfor-mance, while coordinators approached completing survey-based caregiver evaluations with ambivalence. Second, we analyze care-givers’ interactions with CareTech’s staffing practices. Caregivers described experiencing collapsed boundaries between working and personal time. Despite these new challenges, the caregivers and coordinators we interviewed did not mention a desire to leave. .4.3.1 Ambiguity and Ambivalence. While caregivers described providing care as meaningful and were generally content with the conditions they faced on the platform, they discussed a lack of clarity regarding expectations and performance. As Hayden said:I believe that the clients, they also rate us after every shift. So then if we get rated lowly every time or pretty consistently, I’m sure they will reach out tous...I don’t know that it helps us rate our care and how well we’re doing with our clients, but I don't know how else they could do that...you hear stories of people who are dissatisfied with their care, and that's hard to tell.It was only after connecting with other caregivers that Hayden Learned that it was possible to request a performance evaluation form CareTech. Further, the opacity of metrics created feelings of worry for care-givers about their performance. As a new caregiver on the platform,Hazel worried about a low client consistency rating and discussed needing to take the initiative to understand why she received low ratings across other metrics. Puzzled about low application usage ratings, Hazel described needing to reach out to CareTech to understand “what [she] was missing.” CareTech’s communication and evaluation practices created unclear situations with multiple interpretations and required additional labor on the part of caregivers to understand how care recipients experienced their care and how the platform judged their performance. Coordinators, on the other hand, discussed their own evaluation practices as infused with ambivalence—a finding that we found surprising given the intimate and impactful context of care for an older loved one. While coordinators described clear feelings about the care provided to loved ones, our interviewees responded to CareTech’s evaluation surveys inconsistently. Coordinators expressed satisfaction with the care that caregivers provided and thus did not feel a need to fill out the company’s weekly care-giver evaluation survey, described how these surveys were not as useful compared to in-person evaluations performed over more extended periods, or expressed that they did not feel their feedback through these outlets was listened to by CareTech. Phyllis—who lives with her care recipient—described that since the quality of care was so consistent, there was not a need to be very detailed in her evaluations: “they will send out those [surveys] weekly...soyou click on attentiveness, preparation, and I don’t remember what they all are. There’s about five of them. I don’t get very detailed.” On The other hand, Brooks—who did not live with his care recipient,and was dissatisfied with the consistency of staffing provided byCareTech—described feeling overwhelmed by the amount of eval-uating he was asked to do: “For each one of the caregivers that has been in, they’re asking for an opinion for eight to 10 caregivers everyMonday, on the same thing, the same people doing the same thing.I’ve had a hard time seeing the value on a weekly basis.” He saw more value in evaluations carried out over longer intervals as it had been before the acquisition. There used to be the quarterly report where they would actually go in and visit and come back and say,‘this has changed, or this looks like it’s changed’...when someone steps in four or five times a year those are the ones that can pick out some things.Opal, who uses CareTech to provide care to her husband, discussed her attitude towards the surveys: “Honestly, I ignore [the surveys]. It’s not something I want to do. I don’t know why. I know they're doing great.” These perspectives demonstrate a difference in the worth actors ascribed to particular evaluation practices, high-lighting a mismatch between technologists’, coordinators’, and care-givers’ perspectives. Other coordinators described non-use of CareTech’s evaluation infrastructure, even when there were striking departures from care expectations. Coordinators justified their approach by appealing to different moral frameworks. Riley said, “what did happen onetime, and I should probably be more tuned into it...there was one day when one of the caregivers didn’t show up at all. And I didn't know about it until the next day.” She justified the non-use through appeals to a domestic moral framework: “I’m not as hands-on, I’mnot looking at the app to see what they’re doing. I get my feedback on how they’re doing from my mom and dad.” Winnie, who relied on a caregiver to transport her mother to church on Sunday mornings, described situations where sometimes a caregiver assigned to the shift couldn’t drive or had no car. Even so, she did not fill out regular surveys, drawing on her experience as a business owner (industrial)to express that she understood the challenges of staffing shifts: “it’sa very hard thing to maneuver in the world that we’re walking in. We Own a small business. We employ 13 ladies, so I understand.” At the same time, she seemed to negatively moralize non-use: “I will be honest with you that a survey has come...I haven’t filled it out. So I Haven't done due diligence on my part. You know, so I’m going to own that part.” While some coordinators expressed frustration about consistency, communication, quality, and the efficacy of evaluation practices, they appealed to multiple moral frameworks to justify different uses of evaluation infrastructure.4.3.2 Work Practices and Professional Boundaries. Continued dis-cussion with caregivers provided insight into how the problems that technologists faced contributed to aspects of platform design.The need to fill open shifts and coordinate care work across multiple individuals—associated with an industrial moral framework—took precedence over other concerns. Francine’s account of interactions with CareTech provides an example of how the need to staff shifts devalued communication about performance: “they have never given me any feedback or evaluation, the only time they call is about the schedule, asking if you can work more.” We argue that technologists prioritization of needs associated with the industrial moral frame-work eroded the boundary between caregivers’ work and personal lives and changed care practices.For example, the platform uses a notification system to bring open shifts to caregivers’ attention. However, Pepper describe how the constant notification stream makes it difficult for her to differentiate between work and leisure time:I can tell they have a lot of shifts to fill in. Am I go-ing to be under pressure? They’ve asked me for five things, and you said no to all of them, it feels likeI should say yes to something now. It’s just a little harder to be either working or not working...when you see your phone in the morning and you see all those notifications there.Hayden described receiving “30 to 40” notifications a day from the app, even after reaching out to CareTech to express that they would not work any more shifts. Further, they described confu-sion and frustration regarding the processes by which shifts were initially assigned:I actually said no to [the shift], but they scheduled me anyway. Which was how I got a lot of my shifts,which was okay...I know sometimes it sounds weird,but I would say no to a shift, maybe they’d think thatI said yes.This account suggests that the platform does not allow for as much flexibility as technologists imagine.In contrast to legacy record-keeping procedures, where care-givers left paper-based care notes in clients’ homes, CareTech’splatform requires that caregivers describe their shifts upon clock-ing out in an electronic journal that is viewable by coordinators and other caregivers. While caregivers described that the journal helped them feel more prepared for each shift, they also described reading journal entries outside of working hours, which provided further evidence for blurred boundaries between work and personal life.For example, Chauncey described reading entries “at night, before Igo to bed, I start reading if I’m going to work the next morning.” In Addition, platform architecture requiring caregivers to complete these logs changed caregivers’ relationship to time spent on the job. Francine described how filling out the notes, especially in the time-sensitive context of a shift, placed pressure on how she spent time providing care: “if you clock out right at a minute after [your shift ends] they get you on that.” Efforts to avoid disciplinary action created new relationships to time: “I just always try to clock out a few minutes before because you get all these questions before closing out the app” (Francine). In these cases, platform architecture changed caregivers' relationships with their time both on and off the clock,which put caregivers under additional pressure.We found that aspects of platform and algorithm design create new forms of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. We argue that this results from a mismatch between technologists’ moral reasoning and that of other platform actors. In addition, the need to fill open shifts and coordinate work across many individuals pri-oritizes a logic of efficiency over concerns for caregiver job quality.Despite coordinators’ unmet expectations and new pressures that the platform placed on caregivers, both sets of actors maintain a commitment to the platform. A possible explanation for contin-ued attachment is the moral significance of ‘care.’ While the term carries various meanings across actors and situations, it may act as a resource that maintains a particular status quo by mitigating organized critique of or departure from the platform.

For example, Richard described, “being part of something that can have a positive impact on society.” The company’s mission statement, was described as ‘improving care in society6, highlight-ing the significance of a single moral concept in technologists discourse.In discussing the company’s strategy, the technologists we in-terviewed described CareTech as a “platform,” “communication company,” or “logistical engine,”, foregrounding CareTech’s use of digital technology to improve efficiency, and framed their work asa response to logistical challenges in the home care industry. Aiden described what he framed as the company’s main value proposition:I think the big sort of sell is, it is getting harder and harder to operate care. I think it is getting more expensive...the core value proposition is where we are trying to figure out how to build a platform around doing this, and helping agencies focus more on their relationships with their communities and customers.He elaborated that, by centralizing operations, CareTech offers partner agencies relief from work that is “consuming and grueling,whether it’s paperwork, management, documentation, staffing, lo-gistics, or being on call all the time.” By filling this role, CareTech‘frees up agencies to both source customers and maintain that rela-tionship and kind of connection’ (Aiden). Repeated references to the relationship between CareTech and the agencies with which it partners serve two purposes. First, they identify areas whereCareTech uses technology to increase efficiency in the home care industry. This problem formulation provides the background for how organizational solutions are framed. Second, they format a division of labor. In this account, partner agencies are positioned as responsible for managing relationships in local markets, while the platform oversees aspects of labor control and management.Here, technologists frame the platform’s work in industrial terms and partner agencies in domestic terms. 4.1.2 Staffing Practices as Solutions. As they justified their work,technologists also blended elements from multiple moral frame-works. Specifically, they simultaneously appealed to notions of market dominance and civic responsibility. This overlap materialized as Robert, a data scientist, stated that the company’s scale offered a ‘unified view across markets’ and provided access to a sufficient amount of data to use statistical techniques to ‘learn from the data to provide better home care’, serving as a “competitive dif-ferentiator in the market.” In addition, Floyd framed the company's size as affording more ‘careful’ staffing practice:From a systemic perspective, when you are bigger you have these systems in place, and you do not have to guilt somebody into working a shift. If you need a shift filled, you have a stable of hundreds of caregivers you can reach out to, it is just a matter of how much bonus you have to put on it.These rhetorical strategies demonstrate how technologists draw on multiple moral frameworks to present their work as solutions to different problems.Building on discussions of CareTech’s organizational strategy,technologists most concretely articulated their efforts toward ‘im-proving care in society’ through labor management. They started these discussions by problematizing caregiver job quality under legacy home care practices as associated with low wages, few ben-efits, rigid scheduling practices, and little recognition of caregivers efforts. Kennedy critiqued legacy staffing practices on the grounds of fairness and transparency:There’s a lot of favoritism that happens. There’s a lack of transparency. And so as you can imagine, the caregivers who work the most shifts, they’re able to earn the most amount of money. And that’s really helping to improve their lives and livelihoods. Other technologists framed algorithmic staffing as a solution to the legacy staffing practices that Kennedy identified as opaque and unfair. While Kennedy incorporated concerns about material well-being into her critiques, other technologists generally avoided discussing their efforts toward increasing caregiver job quality in terms of a market-based moral framework. This may have resulted from the market constraints of care, where the price for private pay home care is inaccessible for many families. Aria explainedthat raising wages for caregivers would make the price of care“unpayable” by many clients. 4.1.3 Professionalizing Care. Instead, technologists framed their efforts as attempts to improve caregivers’ status and provide them with a career. Aria noted that improving the collective status of caregivers was part of CareTech’s mission since its founding, em-phasizing challenging aspects of the job:I think that a really big piece of what CareTech is try-ing to do and has been trying to do since the beginning you know, elevate the profession of caregiving. Andtruly treat it a profession instead of just a job...because it's a difficult, emotionally intense, sometimes physi-cally intense thing to do.Floyd described further aspirations to elevate caregivers’ status through professionalization:I would say that [career] is a north star for us. I think everyone views that as an innovation that we can and should make, and the profession is worth it... we're working towards it, but we haven’t actually gotten there yet.These discussions highlight the links that technologists establish between different moral frameworks as they respond to a complex set of challenges. While they expressed concern about the value that care holds in society, increasing the pecuniary value of car was viewed as infeasible. Technologists responded to this problem by appealing to the status of the profession. However, technologists most defined solutions came in the form of staffing algorithms.4.2 Datafying CareWe unpack staffing practices at CareTech, which we argue are emblematic of technological solutionism. Our analysis reveals that technologists associated different aspects of staffing algorithms with different moral frameworks. We argue that how decisions are made about who is best suited for particular shifts—and why—is changing with the advent and implementation of algorithmic staffing tools as technologists prioritize efficiency. However, discussions with technologists show that there are tensions present in the use of algorithms. On the one hand, technologists discussed their work in terms of trying to increase caregiver performance. Performance Evaluation metrics break care into a set of constituent elements closely aligned with operational efficiency (an appeal to the indus-trial moral framework). On the other hand, technologists described their work as oriented toward establishing long-term relationships between caregivers and care recipients (an appeal to the domestic moral framework).The metrics and measurements that support algorithmic staffing practices are most closely associated with notions of productivity and operational efficiency. Technologists presented one part of their work as oriented toward increasing the “performance, or perceived performance of the caregiver” (Floyd). They described how this work is accomplished by measuring: (1) timeliness (how frequently a caregiver arrives to a shift on time); (2) consistency (adherence to schedule shifts); (3) application usage (whether or not the caregiver uses the application to clock in to and out of shifts and evaluate care recipient well-being); and (4) call-offs (shifts not released seven days in advance). While this evaluation practice makes care legible based on a discrete set of metrics, the composition of these metrics is oriented toward operational efficiency rather than the experiences of care recipients or care coordinators.Technologists contrasted their work with platforms in the ride-hailing industry7, describing how their work was motivated by the desire to establish long-term relationships between caregivers and care recipients. They referenced algorithms in terms that framed care as a holistic practice, often comparing the product of their work to other intimate relationships. Staffing algorithms have a role at two main sites: as initial schedules were made and when other caregivers called off their shifts. When caregivers are scheduled during their onboarding, staff members at CareTech use algorithmic recommendation systems to match caregivers with care recipients.In both cases, platform architects compared the matching process to other intimate relations between caregivers and care recipients.In Sandra’s words: Once the data are all collected, [the algorithm] gives us a list of caregivers, and it was ranked by most likely to be picked up by the caregiver...there is a...I don't want to say negotiating, but there are conversations that go back and forth. Because it does become an arranged marriage when you’re putting it inside thehome.In instances where shifts opened up with clients, the platform gives caregivers the option to pick up shifts with these clients through a user interface that Floyd described as “not not tinder 8 inspired. In advancing these relationship-based arguments, technologists define quality care by referencing domestic relationships between caregivers and care recipients.On the one hand, technologists seek to build a platform that effi-ciently delivers consistent care to a growing number of older adult care recipients. On the other, they describe their work as motivated by a desire to optimize relationships between caregivers and care recipients. At the same time, they framed their efforts as improving fairness, accountability, and transparency in staffing practices. Pair-ing discussions of metrics—which break care down into constituent elements associated with industrial efficiency—with algorithms staffing practices—which technologists use to frame evaluation in domestic terms—reveals that these actors associate different parts of their job with distinct moral frameworks to meet a complex set of demands. Further, interviews with caregivers and coordinators reveal that these performance evaluation criteria and platform staffing practices are a source of tension and stress.4.3 Platform AsymmetriesWhat are the consequences of technologists’ actions? To answer this question, we turn to platform caregivers’ and care coordinators’ per-spectives and experiences. Contrary to technologists’ aspirations touse algorithms to build a fairer, more transparent order, algorithmic staffing practices in fact created new conditions of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. First, we focus on evaluation practices.CareTech’s app for caregivers displays ratings across several met-rics related to operational aspects of care delivery (i.e., timeliness,consistency, application usage, and call-offs). The platform also sends weekly caregiver evaluation surveys to coordinators but does not share this feedback directly with caregivers. Further, caregivers rarely received qualitative feedback regarding the quality of care they provided. Caregivers discussed how these aspects of platform design contributed to ambiguity regarding insight into their perfor-mance, while coordinators approached completing survey-based caregiver evaluations with ambivalence. Second, we analyze care-givers’ interactions with CareTech’s staffing practices. Caregivers described experiencing collapsed boundaries between working and personal time. Despite these new challenges, the caregivers and coordinators we interviewed did not mention a desire to leave. .4.3.1 Ambiguity and Ambivalence. While caregivers described providing care as meaningful and were generally content with the conditions they faced on the platform, they discussed a lack of clarity regarding expectations and performance. As Hayden said:I believe that the clients, they also rate us after every shift. So then if we get rated lowly every time or pretty consistently, I’m sure they will reach out tous...I don’t know that it helps us rate our care and how well we’re doing with our clients, but I don't know how else they could do that...you hear stories of people who are dissatisfied with their care, and that's hard to tell.It was only after connecting with other caregivers that Hayden Learned that it was possible to request a performance evaluation form CareTech. Further, the opacity of metrics created feelings of worry for care-givers about their performance. As a new caregiver on the platform,Hazel worried about a low client consistency rating and discussed needing to take the initiative to understand why she received low ratings across other metrics. Puzzled about low application usage ratings, Hazel described needing to reach out to CareTech to understand “what [she] was missing.” CareTech’s communication and evaluation practices created unclear situations with multiple interpretations and required additional labor on the part of caregivers to understand how care recipients experienced their care and how the platform judged their performance. Coordinators, on the other hand, discussed their own evaluation practices as infused with ambivalence—a finding that we found surprising given the intimate and impactful context of care for an older loved one. While coordinators described clear feelings about the care provided to loved ones, our interviewees responded to CareTech’s evaluation surveys inconsistently. Coordinators expressed satisfaction with the care that caregivers provided and thus did not feel a need to fill out the company’s weekly care-giver evaluation survey, described how these surveys were not as useful compared to in-person evaluations performed over more extended periods, or expressed that they did not feel their feedback through these outlets was listened to by CareTech. Phyllis—who lives with her care recipient—described that since the quality of care was so consistent, there was not a need to be very detailed in her evaluations: “they will send out those [surveys] weekly...soyou click on attentiveness, preparation, and I don’t remember what they all are. There’s about five of them. I don’t get very detailed.” On The other hand, Brooks—who did not live with his care recipient,and was dissatisfied with the consistency of staffing provided byCareTech—described feeling overwhelmed by the amount of eval-uating he was asked to do: “For each one of the caregivers that has been in, they’re asking for an opinion for eight to 10 caregivers everyMonday, on the same thing, the same people doing the same thing.I’ve had a hard time seeing the value on a weekly basis.” He saw more value in evaluations carried out over longer intervals as it had been before the acquisition. There used to be the quarterly report where they would actually go in and visit and come back and say,‘this has changed, or this looks like it’s changed’...when someone steps in four or five times a year those are the ones that can pick out some things.Opal, who uses CareTech to provide care to her husband, discussed her attitude towards the surveys: “Honestly, I ignore [the surveys]. It’s not something I want to do. I don’t know why. I know they're doing great.” These perspectives demonstrate a difference in the worth actors ascribed to particular evaluation practices, high-lighting a mismatch between technologists’, coordinators’, and care-givers’ perspectives. Other coordinators described non-use of CareTech’s evaluation infrastructure, even when there were striking departures from care expectations. Coordinators justified their approach by appealing to different moral frameworks. Riley said, “what did happen onetime, and I should probably be more tuned into it...there was one day when one of the caregivers didn’t show up at all. And I didn't know about it until the next day.” She justified the non-use through appeals to a domestic moral framework: “I’m not as hands-on, I’mnot looking at the app to see what they’re doing. I get my feedback on how they’re doing from my mom and dad.” Winnie, who relied on a caregiver to transport her mother to church on Sunday mornings, described situations where sometimes a caregiver assigned to the shift couldn’t drive or had no car. Even so, she did not fill out regular surveys, drawing on her experience as a business owner (industrial)to express that she understood the challenges of staffing shifts: “it’sa very hard thing to maneuver in the world that we’re walking in. We Own a small business. We employ 13 ladies, so I understand.” At the same time, she seemed to negatively moralize non-use: “I will be honest with you that a survey has come...I haven’t filled it out. So I Haven't done due diligence on my part. You know, so I’m going to own that part.” While some coordinators expressed frustration about consistency, communication, quality, and the efficacy of evaluation practices, they appealed to multiple moral frameworks to justify different uses of evaluation infrastructure.4.3.2 Work Practices and Professional Boundaries. Continued dis-cussion with caregivers provided insight into how the problems that technologists faced contributed to aspects of platform design.The need to fill open shifts and coordinate care work across multiple individuals—associated with an industrial moral framework—took precedence over other concerns. Francine’s account of interactions with CareTech provides an example of how the need to staff shifts devalued communication about performance: “they have never given me any feedback or evaluation, the only time they call is about the schedule, asking if you can work more.” We argue that technologists prioritization of needs associated with the industrial moral frame-work eroded the boundary between caregivers’ work and personal lives and changed care practices.For example, the platform uses a notification system to bring open shifts to caregivers’ attention. However, Pepper describe how the constant notification stream makes it difficult for her to differentiate between work and leisure time:I can tell they have a lot of shifts to fill in. Am I go-ing to be under pressure? They’ve asked me for five things, and you said no to all of them, it feels likeI should say yes to something now. It’s just a little harder to be either working or not working...when you see your phone in the morning and you see all those notifications there.Hayden described receiving “30 to 40” notifications a day from the app, even after reaching out to CareTech to express that they would not work any more shifts. Further, they described confu-sion and frustration regarding the processes by which shifts were initially assigned:I actually said no to [the shift], but they scheduled me anyway. Which was how I got a lot of my shifts,which was okay...I know sometimes it sounds weird,but I would say no to a shift, maybe they’d think thatI said yes.This account suggests that the platform does not allow for as much flexibility as technologists imagine.In contrast to legacy record-keeping procedures, where care-givers left paper-based care notes in clients’ homes, CareTech’splatform requires that caregivers describe their shifts upon clock-ing out in an electronic journal that is viewable by coordinators and other caregivers. While caregivers described that the journal helped them feel more prepared for each shift, they also described reading journal entries outside of working hours, which provided further evidence for blurred boundaries between work and personal life.For example, Chauncey described reading entries “at night, before Igo to bed, I start reading if I’m going to work the next morning.” In Addition, platform architecture requiring caregivers to complete these logs changed caregivers’ relationship to time spent on the job. Francine described how filling out the notes, especially in the time-sensitive context of a shift, placed pressure on how she spent time providing care: “if you clock out right at a minute after [your shift ends] they get you on that.” Efforts to avoid disciplinary action created new relationships to time: “I just always try to clock out a few minutes before because you get all these questions before closing out the app” (Francine). In these cases, platform architecture changed caregivers' relationships with their time both on and off the clock,which put caregivers under additional pressure.We found that aspects of platform and algorithm design create new forms of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. We argue that this results from a mismatch between technologists’ moral reasoning and that of other platform actors. In addition, the need to fill open shifts and coordinate work across many individuals pri-oritizes a logic of efficiency over concerns for caregiver job quality.Despite coordinators’ unmet expectations and new pressures that the platform placed on caregivers, both sets of actors maintain a commitment to the platform. A possible explanation for contin-ued attachment is the moral significance of ‘care.’ While the term carries various meanings across actors and situations, it may act as a resource that maintains a particular status quo by mitigating organized critique of or departure from the platform.

28,Frustration,Perceived_Problem,"The subject of our case study, CareTech4, is one of several start-upsthat are credited with “reinventing the [home care] agency model”[22]. Prior to data collection, CareTech acquired StayHome, a traditional home care agency franchise. To contextualize our findings,we briefly discuss CareTech’s business model.CareTech partners with traditional home care agencies to support back-end administrative, legal, compliance, and logistics functions in exchange for a share of partner agencies’ revenue, employing caregivers directly. Caregivers assist with activities of daily living(i.e., bathing, dressing, getting in or out of a bed or chair, walking,using the toilet, eating) [43], and instrumental activities of daily living (i.e., cooking, cleaning, transportation, laundry, managing finances) [46]. CareTech’s use of algorithms to match caregivers to care recipients is central to our case. When we started data collection, CareTech’s technology platform had recently been im-plemented at StayHome’s company-owned agencies, providing a unique opportunity to investigate care algorithm implementation.In this paper, we focus primarily on CareTech’s staffing prac-tices. CareTech uses metrics and algorithms, along with human management, to staff shifts. Staffing algorithms have a role at two main sites: as initial schedules were made and when other care-givers called off their shifts. When caregivers are scheduled during their onboarding, staff members at CareTech use algorithmic recommendation systems to match caregivers with care recipients. Evaluation metrics (i.e., timeliness, consistency, application usage,and call-offs), along with other data (e.g., caregiver commute time,number of complaints) are used to match caregivers and care recipients. Coordinators receive weekly surveys about the quality of care provided, and provide responses on a linear scale5. After IRB approval, we recruited participants—technologists (n =14), caregivers (n = 9), and coordinators (n = 7)—through a partnership with CareTech and StayHome for interviews using convenience and purposive sampling [10]. StayHome’s research staff arranged site visit and helped recruit participants. We provided a brief description of the study and a screening questionnaire distributed amongst the caregivers and coordinators over email. This approach provided an opportunity to learn from technologists, caregivers,coordinators who were enthusiastic about sharing their experi-ences with the platform. Table 2 and table 3 provide an overview of participant profiles.(1) Technologists: Technologists consisted of software engi-neers, designers, product managers, and data and opera-tions workers. Software engineers talked about buildingCareTech’s features and the company’s history. Designers Develop CareTech’s front-end user experience for caregivers.Designers, the operations team, and a product manager described how they approached curating the caregiver experi-ence. The data scientists, data analysts, and data stewards dis-cussed the metrics used to measure caregiver performance,the data that staffing algorithms use, and how algorithms work in practice.(2) Caregivers: We use the term ‘caregivers’ to refer to the people employed by CareTech to provide care for pay.(3) Coordinators: The term ‘coordinators’ refers to people that pay for CareTech’s services and coordinate their delivery,usually on behalf of an older loved one. Recruiting interview participants through a partnership with Stay-Home and CareTech potentially biased results toward more positive perspectives of organizational practices. Caregivers and coordina-tors with more negative views about the company may have been reluctant to share their opinions or participate in interviews alto-gether due to fears of retaliation from the platform. Convenience Sampling limited the extent to which we were able to understand differences across demographic subgroups. Future work should explore this issue. Further, recruitment overlooked the perspectives of care coordinators and caregivers who have left the platform due to difficulties This study draws on data gathered from one week of observations performed in July 2022 and 30 interviews conducted between May2022 and August 2022. We conducted in-depth interviews to understand the cultural inputs that shape algorithm design and the implications for caregivers and coordinators. Interviews are well-suited for understanding social dimensions of how people interpret the world and take actions based on those interpretations [64]. Interviews with technology workers show how they make sense of their work and build systems [67], and interviews with caregivers and coordinators show that care practices diverge from organizational philosophy [53]. After several interviews, one researcher visitedStayHome’s global headquarters and a company-owned agency,located in a major Midwestern city in the U.S. The researcher toured the company’s offices and met with support staff. In addition, theresearcher engaged these actors in informal conversations to learn how StayHome and CareTech operate. To understand how the plat-form is presented to caregivers and what aspects of paid care work are emphasized, the researcher observed a caregiver training ses-sion on lifting and transferring techniques at one of StayHome’scompany-owned franchises and attended a virtual onboarding ses-sion with CareTech in the afternoon.We developed the interview guide with interest in valuation and evaluation practices as they occur on CareTech’s platform. Treating valuation as a moral outlook, we drew on practice-oriented approaches to understanding how different actors conceptualize and contribute value in labor contexts [36]. Examining the practices of the people that develop platforms and those who are subject to their architecture provides an opportunity to identify the underlying justifications and actions that shape and transform care work as it occurs on the ground. Interview questions thus sought to elicit interviewees' daily practices, what elements of their work they described as most important, the least favorite aspects of their work,and their ideological orientation towards the concept of ‘care.’After obtaining consent, we recorded the interviews, which lasted between 45 and 90 minutes and took place mainly over Zoom. However, we did interview several caregivers and one coordinator in person. Team members iteratively refined these themes through discussion and mapped them to the EoW framework. We used a third-party qualitative coding tool (NVivo) to complete the coding process. To make theoretical sense of the data, we returned to the literature and iterated between data and extant research. Our findings indicate that technologists drew on several economies of worth—which we refer to as moral frameworks—to navigate the seemingly irreconcilable demands of home care. They referenced multiple interpretations of the term ‘care’ to resolve contradictions.We illustrate this point by first focusing on how technologists described the problems that they claim to solve. Then, we analyze the nature of the solutions they presented, highlighting how technolo-gists imbued different aspects of algorithm design and function with moral meanings. This finding demonstrates the interpretive flexibil-ity of technological artifacts. Finally, we turn to the perspectives of caregivers and coordinators. Their accounts show how algorithmic staffing practices created new forms of uncertainty—the mirror of technologists' stated intentions.4.1 Navigating Contextual ComplexityTechnologists drew on multiple moral frameworks to navigate expectations and demands, appealing to various interpretations of care’ to reconcile the contradictory pressures they face. The technologists we interviewed framed CareTech as a platform developed to address traditional home care agencies’ logistical and opera-tional challenges. In this context, they appealed to an industrial moral framework, framing their work as introducing greater levels of efficiency and rationalization to the home care industry. How-ever, many of the technologists we interviewed also framed their work in terms of a civic moral framework, critiquing prior staffing practices as subjective, opaque, unfair, and harmful to the material well-being of caregivers. Although these two narratives may appear contradictory, technologists unified these demands by appealing to the societal need for more care. For example, improvements inefficiency were discussed in terms of increasing the affordability of care while improving working conditions was imagined as growing the size of the caregiving workforce. We argue that technologists navigate complexity when creating and developing care algorithms by strategically appealing to justifications corresponding to differ-ent moral frameworks, drawing on multiple interpretations of a single term to move between them. Throughout this section, we draw attention to how technologists position algorithmic staffing practices as one solution to the problems they described.4.1.1 Platform Description & Motivations. The rhetoric that tech-nologists and company executives used to describe their motivation for building the platform appealed to domestic and social goods. In press releases and on the company website, CareTech’s execu-tives described their frustrations in searching for care for their own parents. Similarly, technologists invoked ideas of familial respon-sibility, relaying stories about their difficulties in finding care for aging parents. Technologists also drew on more civic-oriented no-tions of good, framing their work with reference to positive social change. For example, Richard described, “being part of something that can have a positive impact on society.” The company’s mission statement, was described as ‘improving care in society6, highlight-ing the significance of a single moral concept in technologists discourse.In discussing the company’s strategy, the technologists we in-terviewed described CareTech as a “platform,” “communication company,” or “logistical engine,”, foregrounding CareTech’s use of digital technology to improve efficiency, and framed their work asa response to logistical challenges in the home care industry.

I think it is getting more expensive...the core value proposition is where we are trying to figure out how to build a platform around doing this, and helping agencies focus more on their relationships with their communities and customers.He elaborated that, by centralizing operations, CareTech offers partner agencies relief from work that is “consuming and grueling,whether it’s paperwork, management, documentation, staffing, lo-gistics, or being on call all the time.” By filling this role, CareTech‘frees up agencies to both source customers and maintain that rela-tionship and kind of connection’ (Aiden). Repeated references to the relationship between CareTech and the agencies with which it partners serve two purposes. First, they identify areas whereCareTech uses technology to increase efficiency in the home care industry. This problem formulation provides the background for how organizational solutions are framed. Second, they format a division of labor. In this account, partner agencies are positioned as responsible for managing relationships in local markets, while the platform oversees aspects of labor control and management.Here, technologists frame the platform’s work in industrial terms and partner agencies in domestic terms. 4.1.2 Staffing Practices as Solutions. As they justified their work,technologists also blended elements from multiple moral frame-works. Specifically, they simultaneously appealed to notions of market dominance and civic responsibility. This overlap materialized as Robert, a data scientist, stated that the company’s scale offered a ‘unified view across markets’ and provided access to a sufficient amount of data to use statistical techniques to ‘learn from the data to provide better home care’, serving as a “competitive dif-ferentiator in the market.” In addition, Floyd framed the company's size as affording more ‘careful’ staffing practice:From a systemic perspective, when you are bigger you have these systems in place, and you do not have to guilt somebody into working a shift.

They started these discussions by problematizing caregiver job quality under legacy home care practices as associated with low wages, few ben-efits, rigid scheduling practices, and little recognition of caregivers efforts. Kennedy critiqued legacy staffing practices on the grounds of fairness and transparency:There’s a lot of favoritism that happens. There’s a lack of transparency. And so as you can imagine, the caregivers who work the most shifts, they’re able to earn the most amount of money. And that’s really helping to improve their lives and livelihoods. Other technologists framed algorithmic staffing as a solution to the legacy staffing practices that Kennedy identified as opaque and unfair. While Kennedy incorporated concerns about material well-being into her critiques, other technologists generally avoided discussing their efforts toward increasing caregiver job quality in terms of a market-based moral framework. This may have resulted from the market constraints of care, where the price for private pay home care is inaccessible for many families. Aria explainedthat raising wages for caregivers would make the price of care“unpayable” by many clients. 4.1.3 Professionalizing Care.

Aria noted that improving the collective status of caregivers was part of CareTech’s mission since its founding, em-phasizing challenging aspects of the job:I think that a really big piece of what CareTech is try-ing to do and has been trying to do since the beginning you know, elevate the profession of caregiving.

I think everyone views that as an innovation that we can and should make, and the profession is worth it... we're working towards it, but we haven’t actually gotten there yet.These discussions highlight the links that technologists establish between different moral frameworks as they respond to a complex set of challenges.

Further, interviews with caregivers and coordinators reveal that these performance evaluation criteria and platform staffing practices are a source of tension and stress.4.3 Platform AsymmetriesWhat are the consequences of technologists’ actions? To answer this question, we turn to platform caregivers’ and care coordinators’ per-spectives and experiences. Contrary to technologists’ aspirations touse algorithms to build a fairer, more transparent order, algorithmic staffing practices in fact created new conditions of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. First, we focus on evaluation practices.CareTech’s app for caregivers displays ratings across several met-rics related to operational aspects of care delivery (i.e., timeliness,consistency, application usage, and call-offs). The platform also sends weekly caregiver evaluation surveys to coordinators but does not share this feedback directly with caregivers. Further, caregivers rarely received qualitative feedback regarding the quality of care they provided. Caregivers discussed how these aspects of platform design contributed to ambiguity regarding insight into their perfor-mance, while coordinators approached completing survey-based caregiver evaluations with ambivalence. Second, we analyze care-givers’ interactions with CareTech’s staffing practices. Caregivers described experiencing collapsed boundaries between working and personal time. Despite these new challenges, the caregivers and coordinators we interviewed did not mention a desire to leave. .4.3.1 Ambiguity and Ambivalence. While caregivers described providing care as meaningful and were generally content with the conditions they faced on the platform, they discussed a lack of clarity regarding expectations and performance. As Hayden said:I believe that the clients, they also rate us after every shift. So then if we get rated lowly every time or pretty consistently, I’m sure they will reach out tous...I don’t know that it helps us rate our care and how well we’re doing with our clients, but I don't know how else they could do that...you hear stories of people who are dissatisfied with their care, and that's hard to tell.It was only after connecting with other caregivers that Hayden Learned that it was possible to request a performance evaluation form CareTech. Further, the opacity of metrics created feelings of worry for care-givers about their performance. As a new caregiver on the platform,Hazel worried about a low client consistency rating and discussed needing to take the initiative to understand why she received low ratings across other metrics. Puzzled about low application usage ratings, Hazel described needing to reach out to CareTech to understand “what [she] was missing.” CareTech’s communication and evaluation practices created unclear situations with multiple interpretations and required additional labor on the part of caregivers to understand how care recipients experienced their care and how the platform judged their performance. Coordinators, on the other hand, discussed their own evaluation practices as infused with ambivalence—a finding that we found surprising given the intimate and impactful context of care for an older loved one. While coordinators described clear feelings about the care provided to loved ones, our interviewees responded to CareTech’s evaluation surveys inconsistently. Coordinators expressed satisfaction with the care that caregivers provided and thus did not feel a need to fill out the company’s weekly care-giver evaluation survey, described how these surveys were not as useful compared to in-person evaluations performed over more extended periods, or expressed that they did not feel their feedback through these outlets was listened to by CareTech. Phyllis—who lives with her care recipient—described that since the quality of care was so consistent, there was not a need to be very detailed in her evaluations: “they will send out those [surveys] weekly...soyou click on attentiveness, preparation, and I don’t remember what they all are. There’s about five of them. I don’t get very detailed.” On The other hand, Brooks—who did not live with his care recipient,and was dissatisfied with the consistency of staffing provided byCareTech—described feeling overwhelmed by the amount of eval-uating he was asked to do: “For each one of the caregivers that has been in, they’re asking for an opinion for eight to 10 caregivers everyMonday, on the same thing, the same people doing the same thing.I’ve had a hard time seeing the value on a weekly basis.” He saw more value in evaluations carried out over longer intervals as it had been before the acquisition. There used to be the quarterly report where they would actually go in and visit and come back and say,‘this has changed, or this looks like it’s changed’...when someone steps in four or five times a year those are the ones that can pick out some things.Opal, who uses CareTech to provide care to her husband, discussed her attitude towards the surveys: “Honestly, I ignore [the surveys]. It’s not something I want to do. I don’t know why. I know they're doing great.” These perspectives demonstrate a difference in the worth actors ascribed to particular evaluation practices, high-lighting a mismatch between technologists’, coordinators’, and care-givers’ perspectives. Other coordinators described non-use of CareTech’s evaluation infrastructure, even when there were striking departures from care expectations. Coordinators justified their approach by appealing to different moral frameworks. Riley said, “what did happen onetime, and I should probably be more tuned into it...there was one day when one of the caregivers didn’t show up at all. And I didn't know about it until the next day.” She justified the non-use through appeals to a domestic moral framework: “I’m not as hands-on, I’mnot looking at the app to see what they’re doing. I get my feedback on how they’re doing from my mom and dad.” Winnie, who relied on a caregiver to transport her mother to church on Sunday mornings, described situations where sometimes a caregiver assigned to the shift couldn’t drive or had no car. Even so, she did not fill out regular surveys, drawing on her experience as a business owner (industrial)to express that she understood the challenges of staffing shifts: “it’sa very hard thing to maneuver in the world that we’re walking in. We Own a small business. We employ 13 ladies, so I understand.” At the same time, she seemed to negatively moralize non-use: “I will be honest with you that a survey has come...I haven’t filled it out. So I Haven't done due diligence on my part. You know, so I’m going to own that part.” While some coordinators expressed frustration about consistency, communication, quality, and the efficacy of evaluation practices, they appealed to multiple moral frameworks to justify different uses of evaluation infrastructure.4.3.2 Work Practices and Professional Boundaries. Continued dis-cussion with caregivers provided insight into how the problems that technologists faced contributed to aspects of platform design.The need to fill open shifts and coordinate care work across multiple individuals—associated with an industrial moral framework—took precedence over other concerns. Francine’s account of interactions with CareTech provides an example of how the need to staff shifts devalued communication about performance: “they have never given me any feedback or evaluation, the only time they call is about the schedule, asking if you can work more.” We argue that technologists prioritization of needs associated with the industrial moral frame-work eroded the boundary between caregivers’ work and personal lives and changed care practices.For example, the platform uses a notification system to bring open shifts to caregivers’ attention. However, Pepper describe how the constant notification stream makes it difficult for her to differentiate between work and leisure time:I can tell they have a lot of shifts to fill in. Am I go-ing to be under pressure? They’ve asked me for five things, and you said no to all of them, it feels likeI should say yes to something now. It’s just a little harder to be either working or not working...when you see your phone in the morning and you see all those notifications there.Hayden described receiving “30 to 40” notifications a day from the app, even after reaching out to CareTech to express that they would not work any more shifts. Further, they described confu-sion and frustration regarding the processes by which shifts were initially assigned:I actually said no to [the shift], but they scheduled me anyway. Which was how I got a lot of my shifts,which was okay...I know sometimes it sounds weird,but I would say no to a shift, maybe they’d think thatI said yes.This account suggests that the platform does not allow for as much flexibility as technologists imagine.In contrast to legacy record-keeping procedures, where care-givers left paper-based care notes in clients’ homes, CareTech’splatform requires that caregivers describe their shifts upon clock-ing out in an electronic journal that is viewable by coordinators and other caregivers. While caregivers described that the journal helped them feel more prepared for each shift, they also described reading journal entries outside of working hours, which provided further evidence for blurred boundaries between work and personal life.For example, Chauncey described reading entries “at night, before Igo to bed, I start reading if I’m going to work the next morning.” In Addition, platform architecture requiring caregivers to complete these logs changed caregivers’ relationship to time spent on the job. Francine described how filling out the notes, especially in the time-sensitive context of a shift, placed pressure on how she spent time providing care: “if you clock out right at a minute after [your shift ends] they get you on that.” Efforts to avoid disciplinary action created new relationships to time: “I just always try to clock out a few minutes before because you get all these questions before closing out the app” (Francine). In these cases, platform architecture changed caregivers' relationships with their time both on and off the clock,which put caregivers under additional pressure.We found that aspects of platform and algorithm design create new forms of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. We argue that this results from a mismatch between technologists’ moral reasoning and that of other platform actors. In addition, the need to fill open shifts and coordinate work across many individuals pri-oritizes a logic of efficiency over concerns for caregiver job quality.Despite coordinators’ unmet expectations and new pressures that the platform placed on caregivers, both sets of actors maintain a commitment to the platform. A possible explanation for contin-ued attachment is the moral significance of ‘care.’ While the term carries various meanings across actors and situations, it may act as a resource that maintains a particular status quo by mitigating organized critique of or departure from the platform.

29,IndustrialMoralFramework,Causal_Theory,"The subject of our case study, CareTech4, is one of several start-upsthat are credited with “reinventing the [home care] agency model”[22]. Prior to data collection, CareTech acquired StayHome, a traditional home care agency franchise. To contextualize our findings,we briefly discuss CareTech’s business model.CareTech partners with traditional home care agencies to support back-end administrative, legal, compliance, and logistics functions in exchange for a share of partner agencies’ revenue, employing caregivers directly. Caregivers assist with activities of daily living(i.e., bathing, dressing, getting in or out of a bed or chair, walking,using the toilet, eating) [43], and instrumental activities of daily living (i.e., cooking, cleaning, transportation, laundry, managing finances) [46]. CareTech’s use of algorithms to match caregivers to care recipients is central to our case. When we started data collection, CareTech’s technology platform had recently been im-plemented at StayHome’s company-owned agencies, providing a unique opportunity to investigate care algorithm implementation.In this paper, we focus primarily on CareTech’s staffing prac-tices. CareTech uses metrics and algorithms, along with human management, to staff shifts. Staffing algorithms have a role at two main sites: as initial schedules were made and when other care-givers called off their shifts. When caregivers are scheduled during their onboarding, staff members at CareTech use algorithmic recommendation systems to match caregivers with care recipients. Evaluation metrics (i.e., timeliness, consistency, application usage,and call-offs), along with other data (e.g., caregiver commute time,number of complaints) are used to match caregivers and care recipients. Coordinators receive weekly surveys about the quality of care provided, and provide responses on a linear scale5. After IRB approval, we recruited participants—technologists (n =14), caregivers (n = 9), and coordinators (n = 7)—through a partnership with CareTech and StayHome for interviews using convenience and purposive sampling [10]. StayHome’s research staff arranged site visit and helped recruit participants. We provided a brief description of the study and a screening questionnaire distributed amongst the caregivers and coordinators over email. This approach provided an opportunity to learn from technologists, caregivers,coordinators who were enthusiastic about sharing their experi-ences with the platform. Table 2 and table 3 provide an overview of participant profiles.(1) Technologists: Technologists consisted of software engi-neers, designers, product managers, and data and opera-tions workers. Software engineers talked about buildingCareTech’s features and the company’s history. Designers Develop CareTech’s front-end user experience for caregivers.Designers, the operations team, and a product manager described how they approached curating the caregiver experi-ence. The data scientists, data analysts, and data stewards dis-cussed the metrics used to measure caregiver performance,the data that staffing algorithms use, and how algorithms work in practice.(2) Caregivers: We use the term ‘caregivers’ to refer to the people employed by CareTech to provide care for pay.(3) Coordinators: The term ‘coordinators’ refers to people that pay for CareTech’s services and coordinate their delivery,usually on behalf of an older loved one. Recruiting interview participants through a partnership with Stay-Home and CareTech potentially biased results toward more positive perspectives of organizational practices. Caregivers and coordina-tors with more negative views about the company may have been reluctant to share their opinions or participate in interviews alto-gether due to fears of retaliation from the platform. Convenience Sampling limited the extent to which we were able to understand differences across demographic subgroups. Future work should explore this issue. Further, recruitment overlooked the perspectives of care coordinators and caregivers who have left the platform due to difficulties This study draws on data gathered from one week of observations performed in July 2022 and 30 interviews conducted between May2022 and August 2022. We conducted in-depth interviews to understand the cultural inputs that shape algorithm design and the implications for caregivers and coordinators. Interviews are well-suited for understanding social dimensions of how people interpret the world and take actions based on those interpretations [64]. Interviews with technology workers show how they make sense of their work and build systems [67], and interviews with caregivers and coordinators show that care practices diverge from organizational philosophy [53]. After several interviews, one researcher visitedStayHome’s global headquarters and a company-owned agency,located in a major Midwestern city in the U.S. The researcher toured the company’s offices and met with support staff. In addition, theresearcher engaged these actors in informal conversations to learn how StayHome and CareTech operate. To understand how the plat-form is presented to caregivers and what aspects of paid care work are emphasized, the researcher observed a caregiver training ses-sion on lifting and transferring techniques at one of StayHome’scompany-owned franchises and attended a virtual onboarding ses-sion with CareTech in the afternoon.We developed the interview guide with interest in valuation and evaluation practices as they occur on CareTech’s platform. Treating valuation as a moral outlook, we drew on practice-oriented approaches to understanding how different actors conceptualize and contribute value in labor contexts [36]. Examining the practices of the people that develop platforms and those who are subject to their architecture provides an opportunity to identify the underlying justifications and actions that shape and transform care work as it occurs on the ground. Interview questions thus sought to elicit interviewees' daily practices, what elements of their work they described as most important, the least favorite aspects of their work,and their ideological orientation towards the concept of ‘care.’After obtaining consent, we recorded the interviews, which lasted between 45 and 90 minutes and took place mainly over Zoom. However, we did interview several caregivers and one coordinator in person. Team members iteratively refined these themes through discussion and mapped them to the EoW framework. We used a third-party qualitative coding tool (NVivo) to complete the coding process. To make theoretical sense of the data, we returned to the literature and iterated between data and extant research. Our findings indicate that technologists drew on several economies of worth—which we refer to as moral frameworks—to navigate the seemingly irreconcilable demands of home care. They referenced multiple interpretations of the term ‘care’ to resolve contradictions.We illustrate this point by first focusing on how technologists described the problems that they claim to solve. Then, we analyze the nature of the solutions they presented, highlighting how technolo-gists imbued different aspects of algorithm design and function with moral meanings. This finding demonstrates the interpretive flexibil-ity of technological artifacts. Finally, we turn to the perspectives of caregivers and coordinators. Their accounts show how algorithmic staffing practices created new forms of uncertainty—the mirror of technologists' stated intentions.4.1 Navigating Contextual ComplexityTechnologists drew on multiple moral frameworks to navigate expectations and demands, appealing to various interpretations of care’ to reconcile the contradictory pressures they face. The technologists we interviewed framed CareTech as a platform developed to address traditional home care agencies’ logistical and opera-tional challenges. In this context, they appealed to an industrial moral framework, framing their work as introducing greater levels of efficiency and rationalization to the home care industry. How-ever, many of the technologists we interviewed also framed their work in terms of a civic moral framework, critiquing prior staffing practices as subjective, opaque, unfair, and harmful to the material well-being of caregivers. Although these two narratives may appear contradictory, technologists unified these demands by appealing to the societal need for more care. For example, improvements inefficiency were discussed in terms of increasing the affordability of care while improving working conditions was imagined as growing the size of the caregiving workforce. We argue that technologists navigate complexity when creating and developing care algorithms by strategically appealing to justifications corresponding to differ-ent moral frameworks, drawing on multiple interpretations of a single term to move between them. Throughout this section, we draw attention to how technologists position algorithmic staffing practices as one solution to the problems they described.4.1.1 Platform Description & Motivations. The rhetoric that tech-nologists and company executives used to describe their motivation for building the platform appealed to domestic and social goods. In press releases and on the company website, CareTech’s execu-tives described their frustrations in searching for care for their own parents. Similarly, technologists invoked ideas of familial respon-sibility, relaying stories about their difficulties in finding care for aging parents. Technologists also drew on more civic-oriented no-tions of good, framing their work with reference to positive social change. For example, Richard described, “being part of something that can have a positive impact on society.” The company’s mission statement, was described as ‘improving care in society6, highlight-ing the significance of a single moral concept in technologists discourse.In discussing the company’s strategy, the technologists we in-terviewed described CareTech as a “platform,” “communication company,” or “logistical engine,”, foregrounding CareTech’s use of digital technology to improve efficiency, and framed their work asa response to logistical challenges in the home care industry. Aiden described what he framed as the company’s main value proposition:I think the big sort of sell is, it is getting harder and harder to operate care. I think it is getting more expensive...the core value proposition is where we are trying to figure out how to build a platform around doing this, and helping agencies focus more on their relationships with their communities and customers.He elaborated that, by centralizing operations, CareTech offers partner agencies relief from work that is “consuming and grueling,whether it’s paperwork, management, documentation, staffing, lo-gistics, or being on call all the time.” By filling this role, CareTech‘frees up agencies to both source customers and maintain that rela-tionship and kind of connection’ (Aiden). Repeated references to the relationship between CareTech and the agencies with which it partners serve two purposes. First, they identify areas whereCareTech uses technology to increase efficiency in the home care industry. This problem formulation provides the background for how organizational solutions are framed. Second, they format a division of labor. In this account, partner agencies are positioned as responsible for managing relationships in local markets, while the platform oversees aspects of labor control and management.Here, technologists frame the platform’s work in industrial terms and partner agencies in domestic terms. 4.1.2 Staffing Practices as Solutions. As they justified their work,technologists also blended elements from multiple moral frame-works. Specifically, they simultaneously appealed to notions of market dominance and civic responsibility. This overlap materialized as Robert, a data scientist, stated that the company’s scale offered a ‘unified view across markets’ and provided access to a sufficient amount of data to use statistical techniques to ‘learn from the data to provide better home care’, serving as a “competitive dif-ferentiator in the market.” In addition, Floyd framed the company's size as affording more ‘careful’ staffing practice:From a systemic perspective, when you are bigger you have these systems in place, and you do not have to guilt somebody into working a shift. If you need a shift filled, you have a stable of hundreds of caregivers you can reach out to, it is just a matter of how much bonus you have to put on it.These rhetorical strategies demonstrate how technologists draw on multiple moral frameworks to present their work as solutions to different problems.Building on discussions of CareTech’s organizational strategy,technologists most concretely articulated their efforts toward ‘im-proving care in society’ through labor management. They started these discussions by problematizing caregiver job quality under legacy home care practices as associated with low wages, few ben-efits, rigid scheduling practices, and little recognition of caregivers efforts. Kennedy critiqued legacy staffing practices on the grounds of fairness and transparency:There’s a lot of favoritism that happens. There’s a lack of transparency. And so as you can imagine, the caregivers who work the most shifts, they’re able to earn the most amount of money. And that’s really helping to improve their lives and livelihoods. Other technologists framed algorithmic staffing as a solution to the legacy staffing practices that Kennedy identified as opaque and unfair. While Kennedy incorporated concerns about material well-being into her critiques, other technologists generally avoided discussing their efforts toward increasing caregiver job quality in terms of a market-based moral framework. This may have resulted from the market constraints of care, where the price for private pay home care is inaccessible for many families. Aria explainedthat raising wages for caregivers would make the price of care“unpayable” by many clients. 4.1.3 Professionalizing Care. Instead, technologists framed their efforts as attempts to improve caregivers’ status and provide them with a career. Aria noted that improving the collective status of caregivers was part of CareTech’s mission since its founding, em-phasizing challenging aspects of the job:I think that a really big piece of what CareTech is try-ing to do and has been trying to do since the beginning you know, elevate the profession of caregiving. Andtruly treat it a profession instead of just a job...because it's a difficult, emotionally intense, sometimes physi-cally intense thing to do.Floyd described further aspirations to elevate caregivers’ status through professionalization:I would say that [career] is a north star for us. I think everyone views that as an innovation that we can and should make, and the profession is worth it... we're working towards it, but we haven’t actually gotten there yet.These discussions highlight the links that technologists establish between different moral frameworks as they respond to a complex set of challenges. While they expressed concern about the value that care holds in society, increasing the pecuniary value of car was viewed as infeasible. Technologists responded to this problem by appealing to the status of the profession. However, technologists most defined solutions came in the form of staffing algorithms.4.2 Datafying CareWe unpack staffing practices at CareTech, which we argue are emblematic of technological solutionism. Our analysis reveals that technologists associated different aspects of staffing algorithms with different moral frameworks. We argue that how decisions are made about who is best suited for particular shifts—and why—is changing with the advent and implementation of algorithmic staffing tools as technologists prioritize efficiency. However, discussions with technologists show that there are tensions present in the use of algorithms. On the one hand, technologists discussed their work in terms of trying to increase caregiver performance. Performance Evaluation metrics break care into a set of constituent elements closely aligned with operational efficiency (an appeal to the indus-trial moral framework). On the other hand, technologists described their work as oriented toward establishing long-term relationships between caregivers and care recipients (an appeal to the domestic moral framework).The metrics and measurements that support algorithmic staffing practices are most closely associated with notions of productivity and operational efficiency. Technologists presented one part of their work as oriented toward increasing the “performance, or perceived performance of the caregiver” (Floyd). They described how this work is accomplished by measuring: (1) timeliness (how frequently a caregiver arrives to a shift on time); (2) consistency (adherence to schedule shifts); (3) application usage (whether or not the caregiver uses the application to clock in to and out of shifts and evaluate care recipient well-being); and (4) call-offs (shifts not released seven days in advance). While this evaluation practice makes care legible based on a discrete set of metrics, the composition of these metrics is oriented toward operational efficiency rather than the experiences of care recipients or care coordinators.Technologists contrasted their work with platforms in the ride-hailing industry7, describing how their work was motivated by the desire to establish long-term relationships between caregivers and care recipients. They referenced algorithms in terms that framed care as a holistic practice, often comparing the product of their work to other intimate relationships. Staffing algorithms have a role at two main sites: as initial schedules were made and when other caregivers called off their shifts. When caregivers are scheduled during their onboarding, staff members at CareTech use algorithmic recommendation systems to match caregivers with care recipients.In both cases, platform architects compared the matching process to other intimate relations between caregivers and care recipients.In Sandra’s words: Once the data are all collected, [the algorithm] gives us a list of caregivers, and it was ranked by most likely to be picked up by the caregiver...there is a...I don't want to say negotiating, but there are conversations that go back and forth. Because it does become an arranged marriage when you’re putting it inside thehome.In instances where shifts opened up with clients, the platform gives caregivers the option to pick up shifts with these clients through a user interface that Floyd described as “not not tinder 8 inspired. In advancing these relationship-based arguments, technologists define quality care by referencing domestic relationships between caregivers and care recipients.On the one hand, technologists seek to build a platform that effi-ciently delivers consistent care to a growing number of older adult care recipients. On the other, they describe their work as motivated by a desire to optimize relationships between caregivers and care recipients. At the same time, they framed their efforts as improving fairness, accountability, and transparency in staffing practices. Pair-ing discussions of metrics—which break care down into constituent elements associated with industrial efficiency—with algorithms staffing practices—which technologists use to frame evaluation in domestic terms—reveals that these actors associate different parts of their job with distinct moral frameworks to meet a complex set of demands. Further, interviews with caregivers and coordinators reveal that these performance evaluation criteria and platform staffing practices are a source of tension and stress.4.3 Platform AsymmetriesWhat are the consequences of technologists’ actions? To answer this question, we turn to platform caregivers’ and care coordinators’ per-spectives and experiences. Contrary to technologists’ aspirations touse algorithms to build a fairer, more transparent order, algorithmic staffing practices in fact created new conditions of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. First, we focus on evaluation practices.CareTech’s app for caregivers displays ratings across several met-rics related to operational aspects of care delivery (i.e., timeliness,consistency, application usage, and call-offs). The platform also sends weekly caregiver evaluation surveys to coordinators but does not share this feedback directly with caregivers. Further, caregivers rarely received qualitative feedback regarding the quality of care they provided. Caregivers discussed how these aspects of platform design contributed to ambiguity regarding insight into their perfor-mance, while coordinators approached completing survey-based caregiver evaluations with ambivalence. Second, we analyze care-givers’ interactions with CareTech’s staffing practices. Caregivers described experiencing collapsed boundaries between working and personal time.

Further, the opacity of metrics created feelings of worry for care-givers about their performance. As a new caregiver on the platform,Hazel worried about a low client consistency rating and discussed needing to take the initiative to understand why she received low ratings across other metrics. Puzzled about low application usage ratings, Hazel described needing to reach out to CareTech to understand “what [she] was missing.” CareTech’s communication and evaluation practices created unclear situations with multiple interpretations and required additional labor on the part of caregivers to understand how care recipients experienced their care and how the platform judged their performance. Coordinators, on the other hand, discussed their own evaluation practices as infused with ambivalence—a finding that we found surprising given the intimate and impactful context of care for an older loved one. While coordinators described clear feelings about the care provided to loved ones, our interviewees responded to CareTech’s evaluation surveys inconsistently.

We Own a small business. We employ 13 ladies, so I understand.” At the same time, she seemed to negatively moralize non-use: “I will be honest with you that a survey has come...I haven’t filled it out. So I Haven't done due diligence on my part. You know, so I’m going to own that part.” While some coordinators expressed frustration about consistency, communication, quality, and the efficacy of evaluation practices, they appealed to multiple moral frameworks to justify different uses of evaluation infrastructure.4.3.2 Work Practices and Professional Boundaries.

While caregivers described that the journal helped them feel more prepared for each shift, they also described reading journal entries outside of working hours, which provided further evidence for blurred boundaries between work and personal life.For example, Chauncey described reading entries “at night, before Igo to bed, I start reading if I’m going to work the next morning.” In Addition, platform architecture requiring caregivers to complete these logs changed caregivers’ relationship to time spent on the job. Francine described how filling out the notes, especially in the time-sensitive context of a shift, placed pressure on how she spent time providing care: “if you clock out right at a minute after [your shift ends] they get you on that.” Efforts to avoid disciplinary action created new relationships to time: “I just always try to clock out a few minutes before because you get all these questions before closing out the app” (Francine). In these cases, platform architecture changed caregivers' relationships with their time both on and off the clock,which put caregivers under additional pressure.We found that aspects of platform and algorithm design create new forms of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators.

30,Interviews,Artifact,"The subject of our case study, CareTech4, is one of several start-upsthat are credited with “reinventing the [home care] agency model”[22]. Prior to data collection, CareTech acquired StayHome, a traditional home care agency franchise. To contextualize our findings,we briefly discuss CareTech’s business model.CareTech partners with traditional home care agencies to support back-end administrative, legal, compliance, and logistics functions in exchange for a share of partner agencies’ revenue, employing caregivers directly. Caregivers assist with activities of daily living(i.e., bathing, dressing, getting in or out of a bed or chair, walking,using the toilet, eating) [43], and instrumental activities of daily living (i.e., cooking, cleaning, transportation, laundry, managing finances) [46]. CareTech’s use of algorithms to match caregivers to care recipients is central to our case. When we started data collection, CareTech’s technology platform had recently been im-plemented at StayHome’s company-owned agencies, providing a unique opportunity to investigate care algorithm implementation.In this paper, we focus primarily on CareTech’s staffing prac-tices. CareTech uses metrics and algorithms, along with human management, to staff shifts. Staffing algorithms have a role at two main sites: as initial schedules were made and when other care-givers called off their shifts. When caregivers are scheduled during their onboarding, staff members at CareTech use algorithmic recommendation systems to match caregivers with care recipients. Evaluation metrics (i.e., timeliness, consistency, application usage,and call-offs), along with other data (e.g., caregiver commute time,number of complaints) are used to match caregivers and care recipients. Coordinators receive weekly surveys about the quality of care provided, and provide responses on a linear scale5. After IRB approval, we recruited participants—technologists (n =14), caregivers (n = 9), and coordinators (n = 7)—through a partnership with CareTech and StayHome for interviews using convenience and purposive sampling [10]. StayHome’s research staff arranged site visit and helped recruit participants. We provided a brief description of the study and a screening questionnaire distributed amongst the caregivers and coordinators over email. This approach provided an opportunity to learn from technologists, caregivers,coordinators who were enthusiastic about sharing their experi-ences with the platform.

Recruiting interview participants through a partnership with Stay-Home and CareTech potentially biased results toward more positive perspectives of organizational practices.

Convenience Sampling limited the extent to which we were able to understand differences across demographic subgroups. Future work should explore this issue. Further, recruitment overlooked the perspectives of care coordinators and caregivers who have left the platform due to difficulties This study draws on data gathered from one week of observations performed in July 2022 and 30 interviews conducted between May2022 and August 2022. We conducted in-depth interviews to understand the cultural inputs that shape algorithm design and the implications for caregivers and coordinators. Interviews are well-suited for understanding social dimensions of how people interpret the world and take actions based on those interpretations [64]. Interviews with technology workers show how they make sense of their work and build systems [67], and interviews with caregivers and coordinators show that care practices diverge from organizational philosophy [53]. After several interviews, one researcher visitedStayHome’s global headquarters and a company-owned agency,located in a major Midwestern city in the U.S. The researcher toured the company’s offices and met with support staff. In addition, theresearcher engaged these actors in informal conversations to learn how StayHome and CareTech operate. To understand how the plat-form is presented to caregivers and what aspects of paid care work are emphasized, the researcher observed a caregiver training ses-sion on lifting and transferring techniques at one of StayHome’scompany-owned franchises and attended a virtual onboarding ses-sion with CareTech in the afternoon.We developed the interview guide with interest in valuation and evaluation practices as they occur on CareTech’s platform. Treating valuation as a moral outlook, we drew on practice-oriented approaches to understanding how different actors conceptualize and contribute value in labor contexts [36]. Examining the practices of the people that develop platforms and those who are subject to their architecture provides an opportunity to identify the underlying justifications and actions that shape and transform care work as it occurs on the ground. Interview questions thus sought to elicit interviewees' daily practices, what elements of their work they described as most important, the least favorite aspects of their work,and their ideological orientation towards the concept of ‘care.’After obtaining consent, we recorded the interviews, which lasted between 45 and 90 minutes and took place mainly over Zoom. However, we did interview several caregivers and one coordinator in person. Team members iteratively refined these themes through discussion and mapped them to the EoW framework. We used a third-party qualitative coding tool (NVivo) to complete the coding process. To make theoretical sense of the data, we returned to the literature and iterated between data and extant research. Our findings indicate that technologists drew on several economies of worth—which we refer to as moral frameworks—to navigate the seemingly irreconcilable demands of home care. They referenced multiple interpretations of the term ‘care’ to resolve contradictions.We illustrate this point by first focusing on how technologists described the problems that they claim to solve. Then, we analyze the nature of the solutions they presented, highlighting how technolo-gists imbued different aspects of algorithm design and function with moral meanings. This finding demonstrates the interpretive flexibil-ity of technological artifacts. Finally, we turn to the perspectives of caregivers and coordinators. Their accounts show how algorithmic staffing practices created new forms of uncertainty—the mirror of technologists' stated intentions.4.1 Navigating Contextual ComplexityTechnologists drew on multiple moral frameworks to navigate expectations and demands, appealing to various interpretations of care’ to reconcile the contradictory pressures they face. The technologists we interviewed framed CareTech as a platform developed to address traditional home care agencies’ logistical and opera-tional challenges. In this context, they appealed to an industrial moral framework, framing their work as introducing greater levels of efficiency and rationalization to the home care industry. How-ever, many of the technologists we interviewed also framed their work in terms of a civic moral framework, critiquing prior staffing practices as subjective, opaque, unfair, and harmful to the material well-being of caregivers. Although these two narratives may appear contradictory, technologists unified these demands by appealing to the societal need for more care. For example, improvements inefficiency were discussed in terms of increasing the affordability of care while improving working conditions was imagined as growing the size of the caregiving workforce. We argue that technologists navigate complexity when creating and developing care algorithms by strategically appealing to justifications corresponding to differ-ent moral frameworks, drawing on multiple interpretations of a single term to move between them. Throughout this section, we draw attention to how technologists position algorithmic staffing practices as one solution to the problems they described.4.1.1 Platform Description & Motivations. The rhetoric that tech-nologists and company executives used to describe their motivation for building the platform appealed to domestic and social goods. In press releases and on the company website, CareTech’s execu-tives described their frustrations in searching for care for their own parents. Similarly, technologists invoked ideas of familial respon-sibility, relaying stories about their difficulties in finding care for aging parents. Technologists also drew on more civic-oriented no-tions of good, framing their work with reference to positive social change. For example, Richard described, “being part of something that can have a positive impact on society.” The company’s mission statement, was described as ‘improving care in society6, highlight-ing the significance of a single moral concept in technologists discourse.In discussing the company’s strategy, the technologists we in-terviewed described CareTech as a “platform,” “communication company,” or “logistical engine,”, foregrounding CareTech’s use of digital technology to improve efficiency, and framed their work asa response to logistical challenges in the home care industry. Aiden described what he framed as the company’s main value proposition:I think the big sort of sell is, it is getting harder and harder to operate care. I think it is getting more expensive...the core value proposition is where we are trying to figure out how to build a platform around doing this, and helping agencies focus more on their relationships with their communities and customers.He elaborated that, by centralizing operations, CareTech offers partner agencies relief from work that is “consuming and grueling,whether it’s paperwork, management, documentation, staffing, lo-gistics, or being on call all the time.” By filling this role, CareTech‘frees up agencies to both source customers and maintain that rela-tionship and kind of connection’ (Aiden). Repeated references to the relationship between CareTech and the agencies with which it partners serve two purposes. First, they identify areas whereCareTech uses technology to increase efficiency in the home care industry. This problem formulation provides the background for how organizational solutions are framed. Second, they format a division of labor. In this account, partner agencies are positioned as responsible for managing relationships in local markets, while the platform oversees aspects of labor control and management.Here, technologists frame the platform’s work in industrial terms and partner agencies in domestic terms. 4.1.2 Staffing Practices as Solutions. As they justified their work,technologists also blended elements from multiple moral frame-works. Specifically, they simultaneously appealed to notions of market dominance and civic responsibility. This overlap materialized as Robert, a data scientist, stated that the company’s scale offered a ‘unified view across markets’ and provided access to a sufficient amount of data to use statistical techniques to ‘learn from the data to provide better home care’, serving as a “competitive dif-ferentiator in the market.” In addition, Floyd framed the company's size as affording more ‘careful’ staffing practice:From a systemic perspective, when you are bigger you have these systems in place, and you do not have to guilt somebody into working a shift. If you need a shift filled, you have a stable of hundreds of caregivers you can reach out to, it is just a matter of how much bonus you have to put on it.These rhetorical strategies demonstrate how technologists draw on multiple moral frameworks to present their work as solutions to different problems.Building on discussions of CareTech’s organizational strategy,technologists most concretely articulated their efforts toward ‘im-proving care in society’ through labor management. They started these discussions by problematizing caregiver job quality under legacy home care practices as associated with low wages, few ben-efits, rigid scheduling practices, and little recognition of caregivers efforts. Kennedy critiqued legacy staffing practices on the grounds of fairness and transparency:There’s a lot of favoritism that happens. There’s a lack of transparency. And so as you can imagine, the caregivers who work the most shifts, they’re able to earn the most amount of money. And that’s really helping to improve their lives and livelihoods. Other technologists framed algorithmic staffing as a solution to the legacy staffing practices that Kennedy identified as opaque and unfair. While Kennedy incorporated concerns about material well-being into her critiques, other technologists generally avoided discussing their efforts toward increasing caregiver job quality in terms of a market-based moral framework. This may have resulted from the market constraints of care, where the price for private pay home care is inaccessible for many families. Aria explainedthat raising wages for caregivers would make the price of care“unpayable” by many clients. 4.1.3 Professionalizing Care. Instead, technologists framed their efforts as attempts to improve caregivers’ status and provide them with a career. Aria noted that improving the collective status of caregivers was part of CareTech’s mission since its founding, em-phasizing challenging aspects of the job:I think that a really big piece of what CareTech is try-ing to do and has been trying to do since the beginning you know, elevate the profession of caregiving. Andtruly treat it a profession instead of just a job...because it's a difficult, emotionally intense, sometimes physi-cally intense thing to do.Floyd described further aspirations to elevate caregivers’ status through professionalization:I would say that [career] is a north star for us. I think everyone views that as an innovation that we can and should make, and the profession is worth it... we're working towards it, but we haven’t actually gotten there yet.These discussions highlight the links that technologists establish between different moral frameworks as they respond to a complex set of challenges. While they expressed concern about the value that care holds in society, increasing the pecuniary value of car was viewed as infeasible. Technologists responded to this problem by appealing to the status of the profession. However, technologists most defined solutions came in the form of staffing algorithms.4.2 Datafying CareWe unpack staffing practices at CareTech, which we argue are emblematic of technological solutionism. Our analysis reveals that technologists associated different aspects of staffing algorithms with different moral frameworks. We argue that how decisions are made about who is best suited for particular shifts—and why—is changing with the advent and implementation of algorithmic staffing tools as technologists prioritize efficiency. However, discussions with technologists show that there are tensions present in the use of algorithms. On the one hand, technologists discussed their work in terms of trying to increase caregiver performance. Performance Evaluation metrics break care into a set of constituent elements closely aligned with operational efficiency (an appeal to the indus-trial moral framework). On the other hand, technologists described their work as oriented toward establishing long-term relationships between caregivers and care recipients (an appeal to the domestic moral framework).The metrics and measurements that support algorithmic staffing practices are most closely associated with notions of productivity and operational efficiency. Technologists presented one part of their work as oriented toward increasing the “performance, or perceived performance of the caregiver” (Floyd). They described how this work is accomplished by measuring: (1) timeliness (how frequently a caregiver arrives to a shift on time); (2) consistency (adherence to schedule shifts); (3) application usage (whether or not the caregiver uses the application to clock in to and out of shifts and evaluate care recipient well-being); and (4) call-offs (shifts not released seven days in advance). While this evaluation practice makes care legible based on a discrete set of metrics, the composition of these metrics is oriented toward operational efficiency rather than the experiences of care recipients or care coordinators.Technologists contrasted their work with platforms in the ride-hailing industry7, describing how their work was motivated by the desire to establish long-term relationships between caregivers and care recipients. They referenced algorithms in terms that framed care as a holistic practice, often comparing the product of their work to other intimate relationships. Staffing algorithms have a role at two main sites: as initial schedules were made and when other caregivers called off their shifts. When caregivers are scheduled during their onboarding, staff members at CareTech use algorithmic recommendation systems to match caregivers with care recipients.In both cases, platform architects compared the matching process to other intimate relations between caregivers and care recipients.In Sandra’s words: Once the data are all collected, [the algorithm] gives us a list of caregivers, and it was ranked by most likely to be picked up by the caregiver...there is a...I don't want to say negotiating, but there are conversations that go back and forth. Because it does become an arranged marriage when you’re putting it inside thehome.In instances where shifts opened up with clients, the platform gives caregivers the option to pick up shifts with these clients through a user interface that Floyd described as “not not tinder 8 inspired. In advancing these relationship-based arguments, technologists define quality care by referencing domestic relationships between caregivers and care recipients.On the one hand, technologists seek to build a platform that effi-ciently delivers consistent care to a growing number of older adult care recipients. On the other, they describe their work as motivated by a desire to optimize relationships between caregivers and care recipients. At the same time, they framed their efforts as improving fairness, accountability, and transparency in staffing practices. Pair-ing discussions of metrics—which break care down into constituent elements associated with industrial efficiency—with algorithms staffing practices—which technologists use to frame evaluation in domestic terms—reveals that these actors associate different parts of their job with distinct moral frameworks to meet a complex set of demands. Further, interviews with caregivers and coordinators reveal that these performance evaluation criteria and platform staffing practices are a source of tension and stress.4.3 Platform AsymmetriesWhat are the consequences of technologists’ actions? To answer this question, we turn to platform caregivers’ and care coordinators’ per-spectives and experiences. Contrary to technologists’ aspirations touse algorithms to build a fairer, more transparent order, algorithmic staffing practices in fact created new conditions of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. First, we focus on evaluation practices.CareTech’s app for caregivers displays ratings across several met-rics related to operational aspects of care delivery (i.e., timeliness,consistency, application usage, and call-offs). The platform also sends weekly caregiver evaluation surveys to coordinators but does not share this feedback directly with caregivers. Further, caregivers rarely received qualitative feedback regarding the quality of care they provided. Caregivers discussed how these aspects of platform design contributed to ambiguity regarding insight into their perfor-mance, while coordinators approached completing survey-based caregiver evaluations with ambivalence. Second, we analyze care-givers’ interactions with CareTech’s staffing practices. Caregivers described experiencing collapsed boundaries between working and personal time. Despite these new challenges, the caregivers and coordinators we interviewed did not mention a desire to leave. .4.3.1 Ambiguity and Ambivalence. While caregivers described providing care as meaningful and were generally content with the conditions they faced on the platform, they discussed a lack of clarity regarding expectations and performance. As Hayden said:I believe that the clients, they also rate us after every shift. So then if we get rated lowly every time or pretty consistently, I’m sure they will reach out tous...I don’t know that it helps us rate our care and how well we’re doing with our clients, but I don't know how else they could do that...you hear stories of people who are dissatisfied with their care, and that's hard to tell.It was only after connecting with other caregivers that Hayden Learned that it was possible to request a performance evaluation form CareTech. Further, the opacity of metrics created feelings of worry for care-givers about their performance. As a new caregiver on the platform,Hazel worried about a low client consistency rating and discussed needing to take the initiative to understand why she received low ratings across other metrics. Puzzled about low application usage ratings, Hazel described needing to reach out to CareTech to understand “what [she] was missing.” CareTech’s communication and evaluation practices created unclear situations with multiple interpretations and required additional labor on the part of caregivers to understand how care recipients experienced their care and how the platform judged their performance. Coordinators, on the other hand, discussed their own evaluation practices as infused with ambivalence—a finding that we found surprising given the intimate and impactful context of care for an older loved one. While coordinators described clear feelings about the care provided to loved ones, our interviewees responded to CareTech’s evaluation surveys inconsistently. Coordinators expressed satisfaction with the care that caregivers provided and thus did not feel a need to fill out the company’s weekly care-giver evaluation survey, described how these surveys were not as useful compared to in-person evaluations performed over more extended periods, or expressed that they did not feel their feedback through these outlets was listened to by CareTech. Phyllis—who lives with her care recipient—described that since the quality of care was so consistent, there was not a need to be very detailed in her evaluations: “they will send out those [surveys] weekly...soyou click on attentiveness, preparation, and I don’t remember what they all are. There’s about five of them. I don’t get very detailed.” On The other hand, Brooks—who did not live with his care recipient,and was dissatisfied with the consistency of staffing provided byCareTech—described feeling overwhelmed by the amount of eval-uating he was asked to do: “For each one of the caregivers that has been in, they’re asking for an opinion for eight to 10 caregivers everyMonday, on the same thing, the same people doing the same thing.I’ve had a hard time seeing the value on a weekly basis.” He saw more value in evaluations carried out over longer intervals as it had been before the acquisition. There used to be the quarterly report where they would actually go in and visit and come back and say,‘this has changed, or this looks like it’s changed’...when someone steps in four or five times a year those are the ones that can pick out some things.Opal, who uses CareTech to provide care to her husband, discussed her attitude towards the surveys: “Honestly, I ignore [the surveys]. It’s not something I want to do. I don’t know why. I know they're doing great.” These perspectives demonstrate a difference in the worth actors ascribed to particular evaluation practices, high-lighting a mismatch between technologists’, coordinators’, and care-givers’ perspectives. Other coordinators described non-use of CareTech’s evaluation infrastructure, even when there were striking departures from care expectations. Coordinators justified their approach by appealing to different moral frameworks. Riley said, “what did happen onetime, and I should probably be more tuned into it...there was one day when one of the caregivers didn’t show up at all. And I didn't know about it until the next day.” She justified the non-use through appeals to a domestic moral framework: “I’m not as hands-on, I’mnot looking at the app to see what they’re doing. I get my feedback on how they’re doing from my mom and dad.” Winnie, who relied on a caregiver to transport her mother to church on Sunday mornings, described situations where sometimes a caregiver assigned to the shift couldn’t drive or had no car. Even so, she did not fill out regular surveys, drawing on her experience as a business owner (industrial)to express that she understood the challenges of staffing shifts: “it’sa very hard thing to maneuver in the world that we’re walking in. We Own a small business. We employ 13 ladies, so I understand.” At the same time, she seemed to negatively moralize non-use: “I will be honest with you that a survey has come...I haven’t filled it out. So I Haven't done due diligence on my part. You know, so I’m going to own that part.” While some coordinators expressed frustration about consistency, communication, quality, and the efficacy of evaluation practices, they appealed to multiple moral frameworks to justify different uses of evaluation infrastructure.4.3.2 Work Practices and Professional Boundaries. Continued dis-cussion with caregivers provided insight into how the problems that technologists faced contributed to aspects of platform design.The need to fill open shifts and coordinate care work across multiple individuals—associated with an industrial moral framework—took precedence over other concerns. Francine’s account of interactions with CareTech provides an example of how the need to staff shifts devalued communication about performance: “they have never given me any feedback or evaluation, the only time they call is about the schedule, asking if you can work more.” We argue that technologists prioritization of needs associated with the industrial moral frame-work eroded the boundary between caregivers’ work and personal lives and changed care practices.For example, the platform uses a notification system to bring open shifts to caregivers’ attention. However, Pepper describe how the constant notification stream makes it difficult for her to differentiate between work and leisure time:I can tell they have a lot of shifts to fill in. Am I go-ing to be under pressure? They’ve asked me for five things, and you said no to all of them, it feels likeI should say yes to something now. It’s just a little harder to be either working or not working...when you see your phone in the morning and you see all those notifications there.Hayden described receiving “30 to 40” notifications a day from the app, even after reaching out to CareTech to express that they would not work any more shifts. Further, they described confu-sion and frustration regarding the processes by which shifts were initially assigned:I actually said no to [the shift], but they scheduled me anyway. Which was how I got a lot of my shifts,which was okay...I know sometimes it sounds weird,but I would say no to a shift, maybe they’d think thatI said yes.This account suggests that the platform does not allow for as much flexibility as technologists imagine.In contrast to legacy record-keeping procedures, where care-givers left paper-based care notes in clients’ homes, CareTech’splatform requires that caregivers describe their shifts upon clock-ing out in an electronic journal that is viewable by coordinators and other caregivers. While caregivers described that the journal helped them feel more prepared for each shift, they also described reading journal entries outside of working hours, which provided further evidence for blurred boundaries between work and personal life.For example, Chauncey described reading entries “at night, before Igo to bed, I start reading if I’m going to work the next morning.” In Addition, platform architecture requiring caregivers to complete these logs changed caregivers’ relationship to time spent on the job. Francine described how filling out the notes, especially in the time-sensitive context of a shift, placed pressure on how she spent time providing care: “if you clock out right at a minute after [your shift ends] they get you on that.” Efforts to avoid disciplinary action created new relationships to time: “I just always try to clock out a few minutes before because you get all these questions before closing out the app” (Francine). In these cases, platform architecture changed caregivers' relationships with their time both on and off the clock,which put caregivers under additional pressure.We found that aspects of platform and algorithm design create new forms of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. We argue that this results from a mismatch between technologists’ moral reasoning and that of other platform actors. In addition, the need to fill open shifts and coordinate work across many individuals pri-oritizes a logic of efficiency over concerns for caregiver job quality.Despite coordinators’ unmet expectations and new pressures that the platform placed on caregivers, both sets of actors maintain a commitment to the platform. A possible explanation for contin-ued attachment is the moral significance of ‘care.’ While the term carries various meanings across actors and situations, it may act as a resource that maintains a particular status quo by mitigating organized critique of or departure from the platform.

This finding demonstrates the interpretive flexibil-ity of technological artifacts. Finally, we turn to the perspectives of caregivers and coordinators. Their accounts show how algorithmic staffing practices created new forms of uncertainty—the mirror of technologists' stated intentions.4.1 Navigating Contextual ComplexityTechnologists drew on multiple moral frameworks to navigate expectations and demands, appealing to various interpretations of care’ to reconcile the contradictory pressures they face. The technologists we interviewed framed CareTech as a platform developed to address traditional home care agencies’ logistical and opera-tional challenges. In this context, they appealed to an industrial moral framework, framing their work as introducing greater levels of efficiency and rationalization to the home care industry. How-ever, many of the technologists we interviewed also framed their work in terms of a civic moral framework, critiquing prior staffing practices as subjective, opaque, unfair, and harmful to the material well-being of caregivers. Although these two narratives may appear contradictory, technologists unified these demands by appealing to the societal need for more care. For example, improvements inefficiency were discussed in terms of increasing the affordability of care while improving working conditions was imagined as growing the size of the caregiving workforce. We argue that technologists navigate complexity when creating and developing care algorithms by strategically appealing to justifications corresponding to differ-ent moral frameworks, drawing on multiple interpretations of a single term to move between them. Throughout this section, we draw attention to how technologists position algorithmic staffing practices as one solution to the problems they described.4.1.1 Platform Description & Motivations. The rhetoric that tech-nologists and company executives used to describe their motivation for building the platform appealed to domestic and social goods. In press releases and on the company website, CareTech’s execu-tives described their frustrations in searching for care for their own parents. Similarly, technologists invoked ideas of familial respon-sibility, relaying stories about their difficulties in finding care for aging parents. Technologists also drew on more civic-oriented no-tions of good, framing their work with reference to positive social change. For example, Richard described, “being part of something that can have a positive impact on society.” The company’s mission statement, was described as ‘improving care in society6, highlight-ing the significance of a single moral concept in technologists discourse.In discussing the company’s strategy, the technologists we in-terviewed described CareTech as a “platform,” “communication company,” or “logistical engine,”, foregrounding CareTech’s use of digital technology to improve efficiency, and framed their work asa response to logistical challenges in the home care industry. Aiden described what he framed as the company’s main value proposition:I think the big sort of sell is, it is getting harder and harder to operate care. I think it is getting more expensive...the core value proposition is where we are trying to figure out how to build a platform around doing this, and helping agencies focus more on their relationships with their communities and customers.He elaborated that, by centralizing operations, CareTech offers partner agencies relief from work that is “consuming and grueling,whether it’s paperwork, management, documentation, staffing, lo-gistics, or being on call all the time.” By filling this role, CareTech‘frees up agencies to both source customers and maintain that rela-tionship and kind of connection’ (Aiden). Repeated references to the relationship between CareTech and the agencies with which it partners serve two purposes. First, they identify areas whereCareTech uses technology to increase efficiency in the home care industry. This problem formulation provides the background for how organizational solutions are framed. Second, they format a division of labor. In this account, partner agencies are positioned as responsible for managing relationships in local markets, while the platform oversees aspects of labor control and management.Here, technologists frame the platform’s work in industrial terms and partner agencies in domestic terms. 4.1.2 Staffing Practices as Solutions. As they justified their work,technologists also blended elements from multiple moral frame-works. Specifically, they simultaneously appealed to notions of market dominance and civic responsibility. This overlap materialized as Robert, a data scientist, stated that the company’s scale offered a ‘unified view across markets’ and provided access to a sufficient amount of data to use statistical techniques to ‘learn from the data to provide better home care’, serving as a “competitive dif-ferentiator in the market.” In addition, Floyd framed the company's size as affording more ‘careful’ staffing practice:From a systemic perspective, when you are bigger you have these systems in place, and you do not have to guilt somebody into working a shift. If you need a shift filled, you have a stable of hundreds of caregivers you can reach out to, it is just a matter of how much bonus you have to put on it.These rhetorical strategies demonstrate how technologists draw on multiple moral frameworks to present their work as solutions to different problems.Building on discussions of CareTech’s organizational strategy,technologists most concretely articulated their efforts toward ‘im-proving care in society’ through labor management. They started these discussions by problematizing caregiver job quality under legacy home care practices as associated with low wages, few ben-efits, rigid scheduling practices, and little recognition of caregivers efforts. Kennedy critiqued legacy staffing practices on the grounds of fairness and transparency:There’s a lot of favoritism that happens. There’s a lack of transparency. And so as you can imagine, the caregivers who work the most shifts, they’re able to earn the most amount of money. And that’s really helping to improve their lives and livelihoods. Other technologists framed algorithmic staffing as a solution to the legacy staffing practices that Kennedy identified as opaque and unfair. While Kennedy incorporated concerns about material well-being into her critiques, other technologists generally avoided discussing their efforts toward increasing caregiver job quality in terms of a market-based moral framework. This may have resulted from the market constraints of care, where the price for private pay home care is inaccessible for many families. Aria explainedthat raising wages for caregivers would make the price of care“unpayable” by many clients. 4.1.3 Professionalizing Care. Instead, technologists framed their efforts as attempts to improve caregivers’ status and provide them with a career. Aria noted that improving the collective status of caregivers was part of CareTech’s mission since its founding, em-phasizing challenging aspects of the job:I think that a really big piece of what CareTech is try-ing to do and has been trying to do since the beginning you know, elevate the profession of caregiving. Andtruly treat it a profession instead of just a job...because it's a difficult, emotionally intense, sometimes physi-cally intense thing to do.Floyd described further aspirations to elevate caregivers’ status through professionalization:I would say that [career] is a north star for us. I think everyone views that as an innovation that we can and should make, and the profession is worth it... we're working towards it, but we haven’t actually gotten there yet.These discussions highlight the links that technologists establish between different moral frameworks as they respond to a complex set of challenges. While they expressed concern about the value that care holds in society, increasing the pecuniary value of car was viewed as infeasible. Technologists responded to this problem by appealing to the status of the profession. However, technologists most defined solutions came in the form of staffing algorithms.4.2 Datafying CareWe unpack staffing practices at CareTech, which we argue are emblematic of technological solutionism. Our analysis reveals that technologists associated different aspects of staffing algorithms with different moral frameworks. We argue that how decisions are made about who is best suited for particular shifts—and why—is changing with the advent and implementation of algorithmic staffing tools as technologists prioritize efficiency. However, discussions with technologists show that there are tensions present in the use of algorithms. On the one hand, technologists discussed their work in terms of trying to increase caregiver performance. Performance Evaluation metrics break care into a set of constituent elements closely aligned with operational efficiency (an appeal to the indus-trial moral framework). On the other hand, technologists described their work as oriented toward establishing long-term relationships between caregivers and care recipients (an appeal to the domestic moral framework).The metrics and measurements that support algorithmic staffing practices are most closely associated with notions of productivity and operational efficiency. Technologists presented one part of their work as oriented toward increasing the “performance, or perceived performance of the caregiver” (Floyd). They described how this work is accomplished by measuring: (1) timeliness (how frequently a caregiver arrives to a shift on time); (2) consistency (adherence to schedule shifts); (3) application usage (whether or not the caregiver uses the application to clock in to and out of shifts and evaluate care recipient well-being); and (4) call-offs (shifts not released seven days in advance). While this evaluation practice makes care legible based on a discrete set of metrics, the composition of these metrics is oriented toward operational efficiency rather than the experiences of care recipients or care coordinators.Technologists contrasted their work with platforms in the ride-hailing industry7, describing how their work was motivated by the desire to establish long-term relationships between caregivers and care recipients. They referenced algorithms in terms that framed care as a holistic practice, often comparing the product of their work to other intimate relationships. Staffing algorithms have a role at two main sites: as initial schedules were made and when other caregivers called off their shifts. When caregivers are scheduled during their onboarding, staff members at CareTech use algorithmic recommendation systems to match caregivers with care recipients.In both cases, platform architects compared the matching process to other intimate relations between caregivers and care recipients.In Sandra’s words: Once the data are all collected, [the algorithm] gives us a list of caregivers, and it was ranked by most likely to be picked up by the caregiver...there is a...I don't want to say negotiating, but there are conversations that go back and forth. Because it does become an arranged marriage when you’re putting it inside thehome.In instances where shifts opened up with clients, the platform gives caregivers the option to pick up shifts with these clients through a user interface that Floyd described as “not not tinder 8 inspired. In advancing these relationship-based arguments, technologists define quality care by referencing domestic relationships between caregivers and care recipients.On the one hand, technologists seek to build a platform that effi-ciently delivers consistent care to a growing number of older adult care recipients. On the other, they describe their work as motivated by a desire to optimize relationships between caregivers and care recipients. At the same time, they framed their efforts as improving fairness, accountability, and transparency in staffing practices. Pair-ing discussions of metrics—which break care down into constituent elements associated with industrial efficiency—with algorithms staffing practices—which technologists use to frame evaluation in domestic terms—reveals that these actors associate different parts of their job with distinct moral frameworks to meet a complex set of demands. Further, interviews with caregivers and coordinators reveal that these performance evaluation criteria and platform staffing practices are a source of tension and stress.4.3 Platform AsymmetriesWhat are the consequences of technologists’ actions? To answer this question, we turn to platform caregivers’ and care coordinators’ per-spectives and experiences. Contrary to technologists’ aspirations touse algorithms to build a fairer, more transparent order, algorithmic staffing practices in fact created new conditions of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. First, we focus on evaluation practices.CareTech’s app for caregivers displays ratings across several met-rics related to operational aspects of care delivery (i.e., timeliness,consistency, application usage, and call-offs). The platform also sends weekly caregiver evaluation surveys to coordinators but does not share this feedback directly with caregivers. Further, caregivers rarely received qualitative feedback regarding the quality of care they provided. Caregivers discussed how these aspects of platform design contributed to ambiguity regarding insight into their perfor-mance, while coordinators approached completing survey-based caregiver evaluations with ambivalence. Second, we analyze care-givers’ interactions with CareTech’s staffing practices. Caregivers described experiencing collapsed boundaries between working and personal time. Despite these new challenges, the caregivers and coordinators we interviewed did not mention a desire to leave. .4.3.1 Ambiguity and Ambivalence. While caregivers described providing care as meaningful and were generally content with the conditions they faced on the platform, they discussed a lack of clarity regarding expectations and performance. As Hayden said:I believe that the clients, they also rate us after every shift. So then if we get rated lowly every time or pretty consistently, I’m sure they will reach out tous...I don’t know that it helps us rate our care and how well we’re doing with our clients, but I don't know how else they could do that...you hear stories of people who are dissatisfied with their care, and that's hard to tell.It was only after connecting with other caregivers that Hayden Learned that it was possible to request a performance evaluation form CareTech. Further, the opacity of metrics created feelings of worry for care-givers about their performance. As a new caregiver on the platform,Hazel worried about a low client consistency rating and discussed needing to take the initiative to understand why she received low ratings across other metrics. Puzzled about low application usage ratings, Hazel described needing to reach out to CareTech to understand “what [she] was missing.” CareTech’s communication and evaluation practices created unclear situations with multiple interpretations and required additional labor on the part of caregivers to understand how care recipients experienced their care and how the platform judged their performance. Coordinators, on the other hand, discussed their own evaluation practices as infused with ambivalence—a finding that we found surprising given the intimate and impactful context of care for an older loved one. While coordinators described clear feelings about the care provided to loved ones, our interviewees responded to CareTech’s evaluation surveys inconsistently. Coordinators expressed satisfaction with the care that caregivers provided and thus did not feel a need to fill out the company’s weekly care-giver evaluation survey, described how these surveys were not as useful compared to in-person evaluations performed over more extended periods, or expressed that they did not feel their feedback through these outlets was listened to by CareTech. Phyllis—who lives with her care recipient—described that since the quality of care was so consistent, there was not a need to be very detailed in her evaluations: “they will send out those [surveys] weekly...soyou click on attentiveness, preparation, and I don’t remember what they all are. There’s about five of them. I don’t get very detailed.” On The other hand, Brooks—who did not live with his care recipient,and was dissatisfied with the consistency of staffing provided byCareTech—described feeling overwhelmed by the amount of eval-uating he was asked to do: “For each one of the caregivers that has been in, they’re asking for an opinion for eight to 10 caregivers everyMonday, on the same thing, the same people doing the same thing.I’ve had a hard time seeing the value on a weekly basis.” He saw more value in evaluations carried out over longer intervals as it had been before the acquisition. There used to be the quarterly report where they would actually go in and visit and come back and say,‘this has changed, or this looks like it’s changed’...when someone steps in four or five times a year those are the ones that can pick out some things.Opal, who uses CareTech to provide care to her husband, discussed her attitude towards the surveys: “Honestly, I ignore [the surveys]. It’s not something I want to do. I don’t know why. I know they're doing great.” These perspectives demonstrate a difference in the worth actors ascribed to particular evaluation practices, high-lighting a mismatch between technologists’, coordinators’, and care-givers’ perspectives. Other coordinators described non-use of CareTech’s evaluation infrastructure, even when there were striking departures from care expectations. Coordinators justified their approach by appealing to different moral frameworks. Riley said, “what did happen onetime, and I should probably be more tuned into it...there was one day when one of the caregivers didn’t show up at all. And I didn't know about it until the next day.” She justified the non-use through appeals to a domestic moral framework: “I’m not as hands-on, I’mnot looking at the app to see what they’re doing. I get my feedback on how they’re doing from my mom and dad.” Winnie, who relied on a caregiver to transport her mother to church on Sunday mornings, described situations where sometimes a caregiver assigned to the shift couldn’t drive or had no car. Even so, she did not fill out regular surveys, drawing on her experience as a business owner (industrial)to express that she understood the challenges of staffing shifts: “it’sa very hard thing to maneuver in the world that we’re walking in. We Own a small business. We employ 13 ladies, so I understand.” At the same time, she seemed to negatively moralize non-use: “I will be honest with you that a survey has come...I haven’t filled it out. So I Haven't done due diligence on my part. You know, so I’m going to own that part.” While some coordinators expressed frustration about consistency, communication, quality, and the efficacy of evaluation practices, they appealed to multiple moral frameworks to justify different uses of evaluation infrastructure.4.3.2 Work Practices and Professional Boundaries. Continued dis-cussion with caregivers provided insight into how the problems that technologists faced contributed to aspects of platform design.The need to fill open shifts and coordinate care work across multiple individuals—associated with an industrial moral framework—took precedence over other concerns. Francine’s account of interactions with CareTech provides an example of how the need to staff shifts devalued communication about performance: “they have never given me any feedback or evaluation, the only time they call is about the schedule, asking if you can work more.” We argue that technologists prioritization of needs associated with the industrial moral frame-work eroded the boundary between caregivers’ work and personal lives and changed care practices.For example, the platform uses a notification system to bring open shifts to caregivers’ attention. However, Pepper describe how the constant notification stream makes it difficult for her to differentiate between work and leisure time:I can tell they have a lot of shifts to fill in. Am I go-ing to be under pressure? They’ve asked me for five things, and you said no to all of them, it feels likeI should say yes to something now. It’s just a little harder to be either working or not working...when you see your phone in the morning and you see all those notifications there.Hayden described receiving “30 to 40” notifications a day from the app, even after reaching out to CareTech to express that they would not work any more shifts. Further, they described confu-sion and frustration regarding the processes by which shifts were initially assigned:I actually said no to [the shift], but they scheduled me anyway. Which was how I got a lot of my shifts,which was okay...I know sometimes it sounds weird,but I would say no to a shift, maybe they’d think thatI said yes.This account suggests that the platform does not allow for as much flexibility as technologists imagine.In contrast to legacy record-keeping procedures, where care-givers left paper-based care notes in clients’ homes, CareTech’splatform requires that caregivers describe their shifts upon clock-ing out in an electronic journal that is viewable by coordinators and other caregivers. While caregivers described that the journal helped them feel more prepared for each shift, they also described reading journal entries outside of working hours, which provided further evidence for blurred boundaries between work and personal life.For example, Chauncey described reading entries “at night, before Igo to bed, I start reading if I’m going to work the next morning.” In Addition, platform architecture requiring caregivers to complete these logs changed caregivers’ relationship to time spent on the job. Francine described how filling out the notes, especially in the time-sensitive context of a shift, placed pressure on how she spent time providing care: “if you clock out right at a minute after [your shift ends] they get you on that.” Efforts to avoid disciplinary action created new relationships to time: “I just always try to clock out a few minutes before because you get all these questions before closing out the app” (Francine). In these cases, platform architecture changed caregivers' relationships with their time both on and off the clock,which put caregivers under additional pressure.We found that aspects of platform and algorithm design create new forms of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. We argue that this results from a mismatch between technologists’ moral reasoning and that of other platform actors. In addition, the need to fill open shifts and coordinate work across many individuals pri-oritizes a logic of efficiency over concerns for caregiver job quality.Despite coordinators’ unmet expectations and new pressures that the platform placed on caregivers, both sets of actors maintain a commitment to the platform. A possible explanation for contin-ued attachment is the moral significance of ‘care.’ While the term carries various meanings across actors and situations, it may act as a resource that maintains a particular status quo by mitigating organized critique of or departure from the platform.

32,Efficiency,Artifact,"The subject of our case study, CareTech4, is one of several start-upsthat are credited with “reinventing the [home care] agency model”[22]. Prior to data collection, CareTech acquired StayHome, a traditional home care agency franchise. To contextualize our findings,we briefly discuss CareTech’s business model.CareTech partners with traditional home care agencies to support back-end administrative, legal, compliance, and logistics functions in exchange for a share of partner agencies’ revenue, employing caregivers directly. Caregivers assist with activities of daily living(i.e., bathing, dressing, getting in or out of a bed or chair, walking,using the toilet, eating) [43], and instrumental activities of daily living (i.e., cooking, cleaning, transportation, laundry, managing finances) [46]. CareTech’s use of algorithms to match caregivers to care recipients is central to our case. When we started data collection, CareTech’s technology platform had recently been im-plemented at StayHome’s company-owned agencies, providing a unique opportunity to investigate care algorithm implementation.In this paper, we focus primarily on CareTech’s staffing prac-tices. CareTech uses metrics and algorithms, along with human management, to staff shifts. Staffing algorithms have a role at two main sites: as initial schedules were made and when other care-givers called off their shifts. When caregivers are scheduled during their onboarding, staff members at CareTech use algorithmic recommendation systems to match caregivers with care recipients. Evaluation metrics (i.e., timeliness, consistency, application usage,and call-offs), along with other data (e.g., caregiver commute time,number of complaints) are used to match caregivers and care recipients. Coordinators receive weekly surveys about the quality of care provided, and provide responses on a linear scale5. After IRB approval, we recruited participants—technologists (n =14), caregivers (n = 9), and coordinators (n = 7)—through a partnership with CareTech and StayHome for interviews using convenience and purposive sampling [10]. StayHome’s research staff arranged site visit and helped recruit participants. We provided a brief description of the study and a screening questionnaire distributed amongst the caregivers and coordinators over email. This approach provided an opportunity to learn from technologists, caregivers,coordinators who were enthusiastic about sharing their experi-ences with the platform. Table 2 and table 3 provide an overview of participant profiles.(1) Technologists: Technologists consisted of software engi-neers, designers, product managers, and data and opera-tions workers. Software engineers talked about buildingCareTech’s features and the company’s history. Designers Develop CareTech’s front-end user experience for caregivers.Designers, the operations team, and a product manager described how they approached curating the caregiver experi-ence. The data scientists, data analysts, and data stewards dis-cussed the metrics used to measure caregiver performance,the data that staffing algorithms use, and how algorithms work in practice.(2) Caregivers: We use the term ‘caregivers’ to refer to the people employed by CareTech to provide care for pay.(3) Coordinators: The term ‘coordinators’ refers to people that pay for CareTech’s services and coordinate their delivery,usually on behalf of an older loved one. Recruiting interview participants through a partnership with Stay-Home and CareTech potentially biased results toward more positive perspectives of organizational practices. Caregivers and coordina-tors with more negative views about the company may have been reluctant to share their opinions or participate in interviews alto-gether due to fears of retaliation from the platform. Convenience Sampling limited the extent to which we were able to understand differences across demographic subgroups. Future work should explore this issue. Further, recruitment overlooked the perspectives of care coordinators and caregivers who have left the platform due to difficulties This study draws on data gathered from one week of observations performed in July 2022 and 30 interviews conducted between May2022 and August 2022. We conducted in-depth interviews to understand the cultural inputs that shape algorithm design and the implications for caregivers and coordinators. Interviews are well-suited for understanding social dimensions of how people interpret the world and take actions based on those interpretations [64]. Interviews with technology workers show how they make sense of their work and build systems [67], and interviews with caregivers and coordinators show that care practices diverge from organizational philosophy [53]. After several interviews, one researcher visitedStayHome’s global headquarters and a company-owned agency,located in a major Midwestern city in the U.S. The researcher toured the company’s offices and met with support staff. In addition, theresearcher engaged these actors in informal conversations to learn how StayHome and CareTech operate. To understand how the plat-form is presented to caregivers and what aspects of paid care work are emphasized, the researcher observed a caregiver training ses-sion on lifting and transferring techniques at one of StayHome’scompany-owned franchises and attended a virtual onboarding ses-sion with CareTech in the afternoon.We developed the interview guide with interest in valuation and evaluation practices as they occur on CareTech’s platform. Treating valuation as a moral outlook, we drew on practice-oriented approaches to understanding how different actors conceptualize and contribute value in labor contexts [36]. Examining the practices of the people that develop platforms and those who are subject to their architecture provides an opportunity to identify the underlying justifications and actions that shape and transform care work as it occurs on the ground. Interview questions thus sought to elicit interviewees' daily practices, what elements of their work they described as most important, the least favorite aspects of their work,and their ideological orientation towards the concept of ‘care.’After obtaining consent, we recorded the interviews, which lasted between 45 and 90 minutes and took place mainly over Zoom. However, we did interview several caregivers and one coordinator in person. Team members iteratively refined these themes through discussion and mapped them to the EoW framework. We used a third-party qualitative coding tool (NVivo) to complete the coding process. To make theoretical sense of the data, we returned to the literature and iterated between data and extant research. Our findings indicate that technologists drew on several economies of worth—which we refer to as moral frameworks—to navigate the seemingly irreconcilable demands of home care. They referenced multiple interpretations of the term ‘care’ to resolve contradictions.We illustrate this point by first focusing on how technologists described the problems that they claim to solve. Then, we analyze the nature of the solutions they presented, highlighting how technolo-gists imbued different aspects of algorithm design and function with moral meanings. This finding demonstrates the interpretive flexibil-ity of technological artifacts. Finally, we turn to the perspectives of caregivers and coordinators. Their accounts show how algorithmic staffing practices created new forms of uncertainty—the mirror of technologists' stated intentions.4.1 Navigating Contextual ComplexityTechnologists drew on multiple moral frameworks to navigate expectations and demands, appealing to various interpretations of care’ to reconcile the contradictory pressures they face.

While this evaluation practice makes care legible based on a discrete set of metrics, the composition of these metrics is oriented toward operational efficiency rather than the experiences of care recipients or care coordinators.Technologists contrasted their work with platforms in the ride-hailing industry7, describing how their work was motivated by the desire to establish long-term relationships between caregivers and care recipients. They referenced algorithms in terms that framed care as a holistic practice, often comparing the product of their work to other intimate relationships. Staffing algorithms have a role at two main sites: as initial schedules were made and when other caregivers called off their shifts. When caregivers are scheduled during their onboarding, staff members at CareTech use algorithmic recommendation systems to match caregivers with care recipients.In both cases, platform architects compared the matching process to other intimate relations between caregivers and care recipients.In Sandra’s words: Once the data are all collected, [the algorithm] gives us a list of caregivers, and it was ranked by most likely to be picked up by the caregiver...there is a...I don't want to say negotiating, but there are conversations that go back and forth. Because it does become an arranged marriage when you’re putting it inside thehome.In instances where shifts opened up with clients, the platform gives caregivers the option to pick up shifts with these clients through a user interface that Floyd described as “not not tinder 8 inspired. In advancing these relationship-based arguments, technologists define quality care by referencing domestic relationships between caregivers and care recipients.On the one hand, technologists seek to build a platform that effi-ciently delivers consistent care to a growing number of older adult care recipients. On the other, they describe their work as motivated by a desire to optimize relationships between caregivers and care recipients. At the same time, they framed their efforts as improving fairness, accountability, and transparency in staffing practices. Pair-ing discussions of metrics—which break care down into constituent elements associated with industrial efficiency—with algorithms staffing practices—which technologists use to frame evaluation in domestic terms—reveals that these actors associate different parts of their job with distinct moral frameworks to meet a complex set of demands. Further, interviews with caregivers and coordinators reveal that these performance evaluation criteria and platform staffing practices are a source of tension and stress.4.3 Platform AsymmetriesWhat are the consequences of technologists’ actions? To answer this question, we turn to platform caregivers’ and care coordinators’ per-spectives and experiences. Contrary to technologists’ aspirations touse algorithms to build a fairer, more transparent order, algorithmic staffing practices in fact created new conditions of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. First, we focus on evaluation practices.CareTech’s app for caregivers displays ratings across several met-rics related to operational aspects of care delivery (i.e., timeliness,consistency, application usage, and call-offs). The platform also sends weekly caregiver evaluation surveys to coordinators but does not share this feedback directly with caregivers. Further, caregivers rarely received qualitative feedback regarding the quality of care they provided. Caregivers discussed how these aspects of platform design contributed to ambiguity regarding insight into their perfor-mance, while coordinators approached completing survey-based caregiver evaluations with ambivalence. Second, we analyze care-givers’ interactions with CareTech’s staffing practices. Caregivers described experiencing collapsed boundaries between working and personal time. Despite these new challenges, the caregivers and coordinators we interviewed did not mention a desire to leave. .4.3.1 Ambiguity and Ambivalence. While caregivers described providing care as meaningful and were generally content with the conditions they faced on the platform, they discussed a lack of clarity regarding expectations and performance. As Hayden said:I believe that the clients, they also rate us after every shift. So then if we get rated lowly every time or pretty consistently, I’m sure they will reach out tous...I don’t know that it helps us rate our care and how well we’re doing with our clients, but I don't know how else they could do that...you hear stories of people who are dissatisfied with their care, and that's hard to tell.It was only after connecting with other caregivers that Hayden Learned that it was possible to request a performance evaluation form CareTech. Further, the opacity of metrics created feelings of worry for care-givers about their performance. As a new caregiver on the platform,Hazel worried about a low client consistency rating and discussed needing to take the initiative to understand why she received low ratings across other metrics. Puzzled about low application usage ratings, Hazel described needing to reach out to CareTech to understand “what [she] was missing.” CareTech’s communication and evaluation practices created unclear situations with multiple interpretations and required additional labor on the part of caregivers to understand how care recipients experienced their care and how the platform judged their performance. Coordinators, on the other hand, discussed their own evaluation practices as infused with ambivalence—a finding that we found surprising given the intimate and impactful context of care for an older loved one. While coordinators described clear feelings about the care provided to loved ones, our interviewees responded to CareTech’s evaluation surveys inconsistently. Coordinators expressed satisfaction with the care that caregivers provided and thus did not feel a need to fill out the company’s weekly care-giver evaluation survey, described how these surveys were not as useful compared to in-person evaluations performed over more extended periods, or expressed that they did not feel their feedback through these outlets was listened to by CareTech. Phyllis—who lives with her care recipient—described that since the quality of care was so consistent, there was not a need to be very detailed in her evaluations: “they will send out those [surveys] weekly...soyou click on attentiveness, preparation, and I don’t remember what they all are. There’s about five of them. I don’t get very detailed.” On The other hand, Brooks—who did not live with his care recipient,and was dissatisfied with the consistency of staffing provided byCareTech—described feeling overwhelmed by the amount of eval-uating he was asked to do: “For each one of the caregivers that has been in, they’re asking for an opinion for eight to 10 caregivers everyMonday, on the same thing, the same people doing the same thing.I’ve had a hard time seeing the value on a weekly basis.” He saw more value in evaluations carried out over longer intervals as it had been before the acquisition. There used to be the quarterly report where they would actually go in and visit and come back and say,‘this has changed, or this looks like it’s changed’...when someone steps in four or five times a year those are the ones that can pick out some things.Opal, who uses CareTech to provide care to her husband, discussed her attitude towards the surveys: “Honestly, I ignore [the surveys]. It’s not something I want to do. I don’t know why. I know they're doing great.” These perspectives demonstrate a difference in the worth actors ascribed to particular evaluation practices, high-lighting a mismatch between technologists’, coordinators’, and care-givers’ perspectives. Other coordinators described non-use of CareTech’s evaluation infrastructure, even when there were striking departures from care expectations. Coordinators justified their approach by appealing to different moral frameworks. Riley said, “what did happen onetime, and I should probably be more tuned into it...there was one day when one of the caregivers didn’t show up at all. And I didn't know about it until the next day.” She justified the non-use through appeals to a domestic moral framework: “I’m not as hands-on, I’mnot looking at the app to see what they’re doing. I get my feedback on how they’re doing from my mom and dad.” Winnie, who relied on a caregiver to transport her mother to church on Sunday mornings, described situations where sometimes a caregiver assigned to the shift couldn’t drive or had no car. Even so, she did not fill out regular surveys, drawing on her experience as a business owner (industrial)to express that she understood the challenges of staffing shifts: “it’sa very hard thing to maneuver in the world that we’re walking in. We Own a small business. We employ 13 ladies, so I understand.” At the same time, she seemed to negatively moralize non-use: “I will be honest with you that a survey has come...I haven’t filled it out. So I Haven't done due diligence on my part. You know, so I’m going to own that part.” While some coordinators expressed frustration about consistency, communication, quality, and the efficacy of evaluation practices, they appealed to multiple moral frameworks to justify different uses of evaluation infrastructure.4.3.2 Work Practices and Professional Boundaries. Continued dis-cussion with caregivers provided insight into how the problems that technologists faced contributed to aspects of platform design.The need to fill open shifts and coordinate care work across multiple individuals—associated with an industrial moral framework—took precedence over other concerns. Francine’s account of interactions with CareTech provides an example of how the need to staff shifts devalued communication about performance: “they have never given me any feedback or evaluation, the only time they call is about the schedule, asking if you can work more.” We argue that technologists prioritization of needs associated with the industrial moral frame-work eroded the boundary between caregivers’ work and personal lives and changed care practices.For example, the platform uses a notification system to bring open shifts to caregivers’ attention. However, Pepper describe how the constant notification stream makes it difficult for her to differentiate between work and leisure time:I can tell they have a lot of shifts to fill in. Am I go-ing to be under pressure? They’ve asked me for five things, and you said no to all of them, it feels likeI should say yes to something now. It’s just a little harder to be either working or not working...when you see your phone in the morning and you see all those notifications there.Hayden described receiving “30 to 40” notifications a day from the app, even after reaching out to CareTech to express that they would not work any more shifts. Further, they described confu-sion and frustration regarding the processes by which shifts were initially assigned:I actually said no to [the shift], but they scheduled me anyway. Which was how I got a lot of my shifts,which was okay...I know sometimes it sounds weird,but I would say no to a shift, maybe they’d think thatI said yes.This account suggests that the platform does not allow for as much flexibility as technologists imagine.In contrast to legacy record-keeping procedures, where care-givers left paper-based care notes in clients’ homes, CareTech’splatform requires that caregivers describe their shifts upon clock-ing out in an electronic journal that is viewable by coordinators and other caregivers. While caregivers described that the journal helped them feel more prepared for each shift, they also described reading journal entries outside of working hours, which provided further evidence for blurred boundaries between work and personal life.For example, Chauncey described reading entries “at night, before Igo to bed, I start reading if I’m going to work the next morning.” In Addition, platform architecture requiring caregivers to complete these logs changed caregivers’ relationship to time spent on the job. Francine described how filling out the notes, especially in the time-sensitive context of a shift, placed pressure on how she spent time providing care: “if you clock out right at a minute after [your shift ends] they get you on that.” Efforts to avoid disciplinary action created new relationships to time: “I just always try to clock out a few minutes before because you get all these questions before closing out the app” (Francine). In these cases, platform architecture changed caregivers' relationships with their time both on and off the clock,which put caregivers under additional pressure.We found that aspects of platform and algorithm design create new forms of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. We argue that this results from a mismatch between technologists’ moral reasoning and that of other platform actors. In addition, the need to fill open shifts and coordinate work across many individuals pri-oritizes a logic of efficiency over concerns for caregiver job quality.Despite coordinators’ unmet expectations and new pressures that the platform placed on caregivers, both sets of actors maintain a commitment to the platform. A possible explanation for contin-ued attachment is the moral significance of ‘care.’ While the term carries various meanings across actors and situations, it may act as a resource that maintains a particular status quo by mitigating organized critique of or departure from the platform. ","629-30, 631-4",efficiency in the home care industry.,
33,OperationalEfficiency,Strategy,"The subject of our case study, CareTech4, is one of several start-upsthat are credited with “reinventing the [home care] agency model”[22]. Prior to data collection, CareTech acquired StayHome, a traditional home care agency franchise. To contextualize our findings,we briefly discuss CareTech’s business model.CareTech partners with traditional home care agencies to support back-end administrative, legal, compliance, and logistics functions in exchange for a share of partner agencies’ revenue, employing caregivers directly. Caregivers assist with activities of daily living(i.e., bathing, dressing, getting in or out of a bed or chair, walking,using the toilet, eating) [43], and instrumental activities of daily living (i.e., cooking, cleaning, transportation, laundry, managing finances) [46]. CareTech’s use of algorithms to match caregivers to care recipients is central to our case. When we started data collection, CareTech’s technology platform had recently been im-plemented at StayHome’s company-owned agencies, providing a unique opportunity to investigate care algorithm implementation.In this paper, we focus primarily on CareTech’s staffing prac-tices. CareTech uses metrics and algorithms, along with human management, to staff shifts. Staffing algorithms have a role at two main sites: as initial schedules were made and when other care-givers called off their shifts. When caregivers are scheduled during their onboarding, staff members at CareTech use algorithmic recommendation systems to match caregivers with care recipients. Evaluation metrics (i.e., timeliness, consistency, application usage,and call-offs), along with other data (e.g., caregiver commute time,number of complaints) are used to match caregivers and care recipients. Coordinators receive weekly surveys about the quality of care provided, and provide responses on a linear scale5. After IRB approval, we recruited participants—technologists (n =14), caregivers (n = 9), and coordinators (n = 7)—through a partnership with CareTech and StayHome for interviews using convenience and purposive sampling [10]. StayHome’s research staff arranged site visit and helped recruit participants. We provided a brief description of the study and a screening questionnaire distributed amongst the caregivers and coordinators over email. This approach provided an opportunity to learn from technologists, caregivers,coordinators who were enthusiastic about sharing their experi-ences with the platform. Table 2 and table 3 provide an overview of participant profiles.(1) Technologists: Technologists consisted of software engi-neers, designers, product managers, and data and opera-tions workers. Software engineers talked about buildingCareTech’s features and the company’s history. Designers Develop CareTech’s front-end user experience for caregivers.Designers, the operations team, and a product manager described how they approached curating the caregiver experi-ence. The data scientists, data analysts, and data stewards dis-cussed the metrics used to measure caregiver performance,the data that staffing algorithms use, and how algorithms work in practice.(2) Caregivers: We use the term ‘caregivers’ to refer to the people employed by CareTech to provide care for pay.(3) Coordinators: The term ‘coordinators’ refers to people that pay for CareTech’s services and coordinate their delivery,usually on behalf of an older loved one. Recruiting interview participants through a partnership with Stay-Home and CareTech potentially biased results toward more positive perspectives of organizational practices. Caregivers and coordina-tors with more negative views about the company may have been reluctant to share their opinions or participate in interviews alto-gether due to fears of retaliation from the platform. Convenience Sampling limited the extent to which we were able to understand differences across demographic subgroups. Future work should explore this issue. Further, recruitment overlooked the perspectives of care coordinators and caregivers who have left the platform due to difficulties This study draws on data gathered from one week of observations performed in July 2022 and 30 interviews conducted between May2022 and August 2022. We conducted in-depth interviews to understand the cultural inputs that shape algorithm design and the implications for caregivers and coordinators. Interviews are well-suited for understanding social dimensions of how people interpret the world and take actions based on those interpretations [64]. Interviews with technology workers show how they make sense of their work and build systems [67], and interviews with caregivers and coordinators show that care practices diverge from organizational philosophy [53]. After several interviews, one researcher visitedStayHome’s global headquarters and a company-owned agency,located in a major Midwestern city in the U.S. The researcher toured the company’s offices and met with support staff. In addition, theresearcher engaged these actors in informal conversations to learn how StayHome and CareTech operate. To understand how the plat-form is presented to caregivers and what aspects of paid care work are emphasized, the researcher observed a caregiver training ses-sion on lifting and transferring techniques at one of StayHome’scompany-owned franchises and attended a virtual onboarding ses-sion with CareTech in the afternoon.We developed the interview guide with interest in valuation and evaluation practices as they occur on CareTech’s platform. Treating valuation as a moral outlook, we drew on practice-oriented approaches to understanding how different actors conceptualize and contribute value in labor contexts [36]. Examining the practices of the people that develop platforms and those who are subject to their architecture provides an opportunity to identify the underlying justifications and actions that shape and transform care work as it occurs on the ground. Interview questions thus sought to elicit interviewees' daily practices, what elements of their work they described as most important, the least favorite aspects of their work,and their ideological orientation towards the concept of ‘care.’After obtaining consent, we recorded the interviews, which lasted between 45 and 90 minutes and took place mainly over Zoom. However, we did interview several caregivers and one coordinator in person. Team members iteratively refined these themes through discussion and mapped them to the EoW framework. We used a third-party qualitative coding tool (NVivo) to complete the coding process. To make theoretical sense of the data, we returned to the literature and iterated between data and extant research. Our findings indicate that technologists drew on several economies of worth—which we refer to as moral frameworks—to navigate the seemingly irreconcilable demands of home care. They referenced multiple interpretations of the term ‘care’ to resolve contradictions.We illustrate this point by first focusing on how technologists described the problems that they claim to solve. Then, we analyze the nature of the solutions they presented, highlighting how technolo-gists imbued different aspects of algorithm design and function with moral meanings. This finding demonstrates the interpretive flexibil-ity of technological artifacts. Finally, we turn to the perspectives of caregivers and coordinators. Their accounts show how algorithmic staffing practices created new forms of uncertainty—the mirror of technologists' stated intentions.4.1 Navigating Contextual ComplexityTechnologists drew on multiple moral frameworks to navigate expectations and demands, appealing to various interpretations of care’ to reconcile the contradictory pressures they face. The technologists we interviewed framed CareTech as a platform developed to address traditional home care agencies’ logistical and opera-tional challenges. In this context, they appealed to an industrial moral framework, framing their work as introducing greater levels of efficiency and rationalization to the home care industry. How-ever, many of the technologists we interviewed also framed their work in terms of a civic moral framework, critiquing prior staffing practices as subjective, opaque, unfair, and harmful to the material well-being of caregivers. Although these two narratives may appear contradictory, technologists unified these demands by appealing to the societal need for more care. For example, improvements inefficiency were discussed in terms of increasing the affordability of care while improving working conditions was imagined as growing the size of the caregiving workforce. We argue that technologists navigate complexity when creating and developing care algorithms by strategically appealing to justifications corresponding to differ-ent moral frameworks, drawing on multiple interpretations of a single term to move between them. Throughout this section, we draw attention to how technologists position algorithmic staffing practices as one solution to the problems they described.4.1.1 Platform Description & Motivations. The rhetoric that tech-nologists and company executives used to describe their motivation for building the platform appealed to domestic and social goods. In press releases and on the company website, CareTech’s execu-tives described their frustrations in searching for care for their own parents. Similarly, technologists invoked ideas of familial respon-sibility, relaying stories about their difficulties in finding care for aging parents. Technologists also drew on more civic-oriented no-tions of good, framing their work with reference to positive social change. For example, Richard described, “being part of something that can have a positive impact on society.” The company’s mission statement, was described as ‘improving care in society6, highlight-ing the significance of a single moral concept in technologists discourse.In discussing the company’s strategy, the technologists we in-terviewed described CareTech as a “platform,” “communication company,” or “logistical engine,”, foregrounding CareTech’s use of digital technology to improve efficiency, and framed their work asa response to logistical challenges in the home care industry. Aiden described what he framed as the company’s main value proposition:I think the big sort of sell is, it is getting harder and harder to operate care. I think it is getting more expensive...the core value proposition is where we are trying to figure out how to build a platform around doing this, and helping agencies focus more on their relationships with their communities and customers.He elaborated that, by centralizing operations, CareTech offers partner agencies relief from work that is “consuming and grueling,whether it’s paperwork, management, documentation, staffing, lo-gistics, or being on call all the time.” By filling this role, CareTech‘frees up agencies to both source customers and maintain that rela-tionship and kind of connection’ (Aiden). Repeated references to the relationship between CareTech and the agencies with which it partners serve two purposes. First, they identify areas whereCareTech uses technology to increase efficiency in the home care industry. This problem formulation provides the background for how organizational solutions are framed. Second, they format a division of labor. In this account, partner agencies are positioned as responsible for managing relationships in local markets, while the platform oversees aspects of labor control and management.Here, technologists frame the platform’s work in industrial terms and partner agencies in domestic terms. 4.1.2 Staffing Practices as Solutions. As they justified their work,technologists also blended elements from multiple moral frame-works. Specifically, they simultaneously appealed to notions of market dominance and civic responsibility. This overlap materialized as Robert, a data scientist, stated that the company’s scale offered a ‘unified view across markets’ and provided access to a sufficient amount of data to use statistical techniques to ‘learn from the data to provide better home care’, serving as a “competitive dif-ferentiator in the market.” In addition, Floyd framed the company's size as affording more ‘careful’ staffing practice:From a systemic perspective, when you are bigger you have these systems in place, and you do not have to guilt somebody into working a shift. If you need a shift filled, you have a stable of hundreds of caregivers you can reach out to, it is just a matter of how much bonus you have to put on it.These rhetorical strategies demonstrate how technologists draw on multiple moral frameworks to present their work as solutions to different problems.Building on discussions of CareTech’s organizational strategy,technologists most concretely articulated their efforts toward ‘im-proving care in society’ through labor management. They started these discussions by problematizing caregiver job quality under legacy home care practices as associated with low wages, few ben-efits, rigid scheduling practices, and little recognition of caregivers efforts. Kennedy critiqued legacy staffing practices on the grounds of fairness and transparency:There’s a lot of favoritism that happens. There’s a lack of transparency. And so as you can imagine, the caregivers who work the most shifts, they’re able to earn the most amount of money. And that’s really helping to improve their lives and livelihoods. Other technologists framed algorithmic staffing as a solution to the legacy staffing practices that Kennedy identified as opaque and unfair. While Kennedy incorporated concerns about material well-being into her critiques, other technologists generally avoided discussing their efforts toward increasing caregiver job quality in terms of a market-based moral framework. This may have resulted from the market constraints of care, where the price for private pay home care is inaccessible for many families. Aria explainedthat raising wages for caregivers would make the price of care“unpayable” by many clients. 4.1.3 Professionalizing Care. Instead, technologists framed their efforts as attempts to improve caregivers’ status and provide them with a career. Aria noted that improving the collective status of caregivers was part of CareTech’s mission since its founding, em-phasizing challenging aspects of the job:I think that a really big piece of what CareTech is try-ing to do and has been trying to do since the beginning you know, elevate the profession of caregiving. Andtruly treat it a profession instead of just a job...because it's a difficult, emotionally intense, sometimes physi-cally intense thing to do.Floyd described further aspirations to elevate caregivers’ status through professionalization:I would say that [career] is a north star for us. I think everyone views that as an innovation that we can and should make, and the profession is worth it... we're working towards it, but we haven’t actually gotten there yet.These discussions highlight the links that technologists establish between different moral frameworks as they respond to a complex set of challenges. While they expressed concern about the value that care holds in society, increasing the pecuniary value of car was viewed as infeasible. Technologists responded to this problem by appealing to the status of the profession. However, technologists most defined solutions came in the form of staffing algorithms.4.2 Datafying CareWe unpack staffing practices at CareTech, which we argue are emblematic of technological solutionism. Our analysis reveals that technologists associated different aspects of staffing algorithms with different moral frameworks. We argue that how decisions are made about who is best suited for particular shifts—and why—is changing with the advent and implementation of algorithmic staffing tools as technologists prioritize efficiency. However, discussions with technologists show that there are tensions present in the use of algorithms. On the one hand, technologists discussed their work in terms of trying to increase caregiver performance. Performance Evaluation metrics break care into a set of constituent elements closely aligned with operational efficiency (an appeal to the indus-trial moral framework). On the other hand, technologists described their work as oriented toward establishing long-term relationships between caregivers and care recipients (an appeal to the domestic moral framework).The metrics and measurements that support algorithmic staffing practices are most closely associated with notions of productivity and operational efficiency. Technologists presented one part of their work as oriented toward increasing the “performance, or perceived performance of the caregiver” (Floyd). They described how this work is accomplished by measuring: (1) timeliness (how frequently a caregiver arrives to a shift on time); (2) consistency (adherence to schedule shifts); (3) application usage (whether or not the caregiver uses the application to clock in to and out of shifts and evaluate care recipient well-being); and (4) call-offs (shifts not released seven days in advance). While this evaluation practice makes care legible based on a discrete set of metrics, the composition of these metrics is oriented toward operational efficiency rather than the experiences of care recipients or care coordinators.Technologists contrasted their work with platforms in the ride-hailing industry7, describing how their work was motivated by the desire to establish long-term relationships between caregivers and care recipients. They referenced algorithms in terms that framed care as a holistic practice, often comparing the product of their work to other intimate relationships. Staffing algorithms have a role at two main sites: as initial schedules were made and when other caregivers called off their shifts. When caregivers are scheduled during their onboarding, staff members at CareTech use algorithmic recommendation systems to match caregivers with care recipients.In both cases, platform architects compared the matching process to other intimate relations between caregivers and care recipients.In Sandra’s words: Once the data are all collected, [the algorithm] gives us a list of caregivers, and it was ranked by most likely to be picked up by the caregiver...there is a...I don't want to say negotiating, but there are conversations that go back and forth. Because it does become an arranged marriage when you’re putting it inside thehome.In instances where shifts opened up with clients, the platform gives caregivers the option to pick up shifts with these clients through a user interface that Floyd described as “not not tinder 8 inspired. In advancing these relationship-based arguments, technologists define quality care by referencing domestic relationships between caregivers and care recipients.On the one hand, technologists seek to build a platform that effi-ciently delivers consistent care to a growing number of older adult care recipients. On the other, they describe their work as motivated by a desire to optimize relationships between caregivers and care recipients. At the same time, they framed their efforts as improving fairness, accountability, and transparency in staffing practices. Pair-ing discussions of metrics—which break care down into constituent elements associated with industrial efficiency—with algorithms staffing practices—which technologists use to frame evaluation in domestic terms—reveals that these actors associate different parts of their job with distinct moral frameworks to meet a complex set of demands. Further, interviews with caregivers and coordinators reveal that these performance evaluation criteria and platform staffing practices are a source of tension and stress.4.3 Platform AsymmetriesWhat are the consequences of technologists’ actions? To answer this question, we turn to platform caregivers’ and care coordinators’ per-spectives and experiences. Contrary to technologists’ aspirations touse algorithms to build a fairer, more transparent order, algorithmic staffing practices in fact created new conditions of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. First, we focus on evaluation practices.CareTech’s app for caregivers displays ratings across several met-rics related to operational aspects of care delivery (i.e., timeliness,consistency, application usage, and call-offs). The platform also sends weekly caregiver evaluation surveys to coordinators but does not share this feedback directly with caregivers. Further, caregivers rarely received qualitative feedback regarding the quality of care they provided. Caregivers discussed how these aspects of platform design contributed to ambiguity regarding insight into their perfor-mance, while coordinators approached completing survey-based caregiver evaluations with ambivalence.

So I Haven't done due diligence on my part. You know, so I’m going to own that part.” While some coordinators expressed frustration about consistency, communication, quality, and the efficacy of evaluation practices, they appealed to multiple moral frameworks to justify different uses of evaluation infrastructure.4.3.2 Work Practices and Professional Boundaries. Continued dis-cussion with caregivers provided insight into how the problems that technologists faced contributed to aspects of platform design.The need to fill open shifts and coordinate care work across multiple individuals—associated with an industrial moral framework—took precedence over other concerns. Francine’s account of interactions with CareTech provides an example of how the need to staff shifts devalued communication about performance: “they have never given me any feedback or evaluation, the only time they call is about the schedule, asking if you can work more.” We argue that technologists prioritization of needs associated with the industrial moral frame-work eroded the boundary between caregivers’ work and personal lives and changed care practices.For example, the platform uses a notification system to bring open shifts to caregivers’ attention. However, Pepper describe how the constant notification stream makes it difficult for her to differentiate between work and leisure time:I can tell they have a lot of shifts to fill in. Am I go-ing to be under pressure? They’ve asked me for five things, and you said no to all of them, it feels likeI should say yes to something now. It’s just a little harder to be either working or not working...when you see your phone in the morning and you see all those notifications there.Hayden described receiving “30 to 40” notifications a day from the app, even after reaching out to CareTech to express that they would not work any more shifts. Further, they described confu-sion and frustration regarding the processes by which shifts were initially assigned:I actually said no to [the shift], but they scheduled me anyway. Which was how I got a lot of my shifts,which was okay...I know sometimes it sounds weird,but I would say no to a shift, maybe they’d think thatI said yes.This account suggests that the platform does not allow for as much flexibility as technologists imagine.In contrast to legacy record-keeping procedures, where care-givers left paper-based care notes in clients’ homes, CareTech’splatform requires that caregivers describe their shifts upon clock-ing out in an electronic journal that is viewable by coordinators and other caregivers. While caregivers described that the journal helped them feel more prepared for each shift, they also described reading journal entries outside of working hours, which provided further evidence for blurred boundaries between work and personal life.For example, Chauncey described reading entries “at night, before Igo to bed, I start reading if I’m going to work the next morning.” In Addition, platform architecture requiring caregivers to complete these logs changed caregivers’ relationship to time spent on the job. Francine described how filling out the notes, especially in the time-sensitive context of a shift, placed pressure on how she spent time providing care: “if you clock out right at a minute after [your shift ends] they get you on that.” Efforts to avoid disciplinary action created new relationships to time: “I just always try to clock out a few minutes before because you get all these questions before closing out the app” (Francine). In these cases, platform architecture changed caregivers' relationships with their time both on and off the clock,which put caregivers under additional pressure.We found that aspects of platform and algorithm design create new forms of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. We argue that this results from a mismatch between technologists’ moral reasoning and that of other platform actors. In addition, the need to fill open shifts and coordinate work across many individuals pri-oritizes a logic of efficiency over concerns for caregiver job quality.Despite coordinators’ unmet expectations and new pressures that the platform placed on caregivers, both sets of actors maintain a commitment to the platform.

37,CareTech,hasProducedArtifact,Staffing,"The subject of our case study, CareTech4, is one of several start-upsthat are credited with “reinventing the [home care] agency model”[22]. Prior to data collection, CareTech acquired StayHome, a traditional home care agency franchise. To contextualize our findings,we briefly discuss CareTech’s business model.CareTech partners with traditional home care agencies to support back-end administrative, legal, compliance, and logistics functions in exchange for a share of partner agencies’ revenue, employing caregivers directly. Caregivers assist with activities of daily living(i.e., bathing, dressing, getting in or out of a bed or chair, walking,using the toilet, eating) [43], and instrumental activities of daily living (i.e., cooking, cleaning, transportation, laundry, managing finances) [46]. CareTech’s use of algorithms to match caregivers to care recipients is central to our case. When we started data collection, CareTech’s technology platform had recently been im-plemented at StayHome’s company-owned agencies, providing a unique opportunity to investigate care algorithm implementation.In this paper, we focus primarily on CareTech’s staffing prac-tices. CareTech uses metrics and algorithms, along with human management, to staff shifts. Staffing algorithms have a role at two main sites: as initial schedules were made and when other care-givers called off their shifts. When caregivers are scheduled during their onboarding, staff members at CareTech use algorithmic recommendation systems to match caregivers with care recipients. Evaluation metrics (i.e., timeliness, consistency, application usage,and call-offs), along with other data (e.g., caregiver commute time,number of complaints) are used to match caregivers and care recipients. Coordinators receive weekly surveys about the quality of care provided, and provide responses on a linear scale5. After IRB approval, we recruited participants—technologists (n =14), caregivers (n = 9), and coordinators (n = 7)—through a partnership with CareTech and StayHome for interviews using convenience and purposive sampling [10]. StayHome’s research staff arranged site visit and helped recruit participants. We provided a brief description of the study and a screening questionnaire distributed amongst the caregivers and coordinators over email. This approach provided an opportunity to learn from technologists, caregivers,coordinators who were enthusiastic about sharing their experi-ences with the platform.

Recruiting interview participants through a partnership with Stay-Home and CareTech potentially biased results toward more positive perspectives of organizational practices. Caregivers and coordina-tors with more negative views about the company may have been reluctant to share their opinions or participate in interviews alto-gether due to fears of retaliation from the platform. Convenience Sampling limited the extent to which we were able to understand differences across demographic subgroups. Future work should explore this issue. Further, recruitment overlooked the perspectives of care coordinators and caregivers who have left the platform due to difficulties This study draws on data gathered from one week of observations performed in July 2022 and 30 interviews conducted between May2022 and August 2022. We conducted in-depth interviews to understand the cultural inputs that shape algorithm design and the implications for caregivers and coordinators. Interviews are well-suited for understanding social dimensions of how people interpret the world and take actions based on those interpretations [64]. Interviews with technology workers show how they make sense of their work and build systems [67], and interviews with caregivers and coordinators show that care practices diverge from organizational philosophy [53]. After several interviews, one researcher visitedStayHome’s global headquarters and a company-owned agency,located in a major Midwestern city in the U.S. The researcher toured the company’s offices and met with support staff. In addition, theresearcher engaged these actors in informal conversations to learn how StayHome and CareTech operate. To understand how the plat-form is presented to caregivers and what aspects of paid care work are emphasized, the researcher observed a caregiver training ses-sion on lifting and transferring techniques at one of StayHome’scompany-owned franchises and attended a virtual onboarding ses-sion with CareTech in the afternoon.We developed the interview guide with interest in valuation and evaluation practices as they occur on CareTech’s platform. Treating valuation as a moral outlook, we drew on practice-oriented approaches to understanding how different actors conceptualize and contribute value in labor contexts [36]. Examining the practices of the people that develop platforms and those who are subject to their architecture provides an opportunity to identify the underlying justifications and actions that shape and transform care work as it occurs on the ground. Interview questions thus sought to elicit interviewees' daily practices, what elements of their work they described as most important, the least favorite aspects of their work,and their ideological orientation towards the concept of ‘care.’After obtaining consent, we recorded the interviews, which lasted between 45 and 90 minutes and took place mainly over Zoom. However, we did interview several caregivers and one coordinator in person. Team members iteratively refined these themes through discussion and mapped them to the EoW framework. We used a third-party qualitative coding tool (NVivo) to complete the coding process. To make theoretical sense of the data, we returned to the literature and iterated between data and extant research. Our findings indicate that technologists drew on several economies of worth—which we refer to as moral frameworks—to navigate the seemingly irreconcilable demands of home care. They referenced multiple interpretations of the term ‘care’ to resolve contradictions.We illustrate this point by first focusing on how technologists described the problems that they claim to solve. Then, we analyze the nature of the solutions they presented, highlighting how technolo-gists imbued different aspects of algorithm design and function with moral meanings. This finding demonstrates the interpretive flexibil-ity of technological artifacts. Finally, we turn to the perspectives of caregivers and coordinators. Their accounts show how algorithmic staffing practices created new forms of uncertainty—the mirror of technologists' stated intentions.4.1 Navigating Contextual ComplexityTechnologists drew on multiple moral frameworks to navigate expectations and demands, appealing to various interpretations of care’ to reconcile the contradictory pressures they face. The technologists we interviewed framed CareTech as a platform developed to address traditional home care agencies’ logistical and opera-tional challenges. In this context, they appealed to an industrial moral framework, framing their work as introducing greater levels of efficiency and rationalization to the home care industry. How-ever, many of the technologists we interviewed also framed their work in terms of a civic moral framework, critiquing prior staffing practices as subjective, opaque, unfair, and harmful to the material well-being of caregivers. Although these two narratives may appear contradictory, technologists unified these demands by appealing to the societal need for more care. For example, improvements inefficiency were discussed in terms of increasing the affordability of care while improving working conditions was imagined as growing the size of the caregiving workforce. We argue that technologists navigate complexity when creating and developing care algorithms by strategically appealing to justifications corresponding to differ-ent moral frameworks, drawing on multiple interpretations of a single term to move between them. Throughout this section, we draw attention to how technologists position algorithmic staffing practices as one solution to the problems they described.4.1.1 Platform Description & Motivations. The rhetoric that tech-nologists and company executives used to describe their motivation for building the platform appealed to domestic and social goods. In press releases and on the company website, CareTech’s execu-tives described their frustrations in searching for care for their own parents. Similarly, technologists invoked ideas of familial respon-sibility, relaying stories about their difficulties in finding care for aging parents. Technologists also drew on more civic-oriented no-tions of good, framing their work with reference to positive social change. For example, Richard described, “being part of something that can have a positive impact on society.” The company’s mission statement, was described as ‘improving care in society6, highlight-ing the significance of a single moral concept in technologists discourse.In discussing the company’s strategy, the technologists we in-terviewed described CareTech as a “platform,” “communication company,” or “logistical engine,”, foregrounding CareTech’s use of digital technology to improve efficiency, and framed their work asa response to logistical challenges in the home care industry. Aiden described what he framed as the company’s main value proposition:I think the big sort of sell is, it is getting harder and harder to operate care. I think it is getting more expensive...the core value proposition is where we are trying to figure out how to build a platform around doing this, and helping agencies focus more on their relationships with their communities and customers.He elaborated that, by centralizing operations, CareTech offers partner agencies relief from work that is “consuming and grueling,whether it’s paperwork, management, documentation, staffing, lo-gistics, or being on call all the time.” By filling this role, CareTech‘frees up agencies to both source customers and maintain that rela-tionship and kind of connection’ (Aiden). Repeated references to the relationship between CareTech and the agencies with which it partners serve two purposes. First, they identify areas whereCareTech uses technology to increase efficiency in the home care industry. This problem formulation provides the background for how organizational solutions are framed. Second, they format a division of labor. In this account, partner agencies are positioned as responsible for managing relationships in local markets, while the platform oversees aspects of labor control and management.Here, technologists frame the platform’s work in industrial terms and partner agencies in domestic terms. 4.1.2 Staffing Practices as Solutions. As they justified their work,technologists also blended elements from multiple moral frame-works. Specifically, they simultaneously appealed to notions of market dominance and civic responsibility. This overlap materialized as Robert, a data scientist, stated that the company’s scale offered a ‘unified view across markets’ and provided access to a sufficient amount of data to use statistical techniques to ‘learn from the data to provide better home care’, serving as a “competitive dif-ferentiator in the market.” In addition, Floyd framed the company's size as affording more ‘careful’ staffing practice:From a systemic perspective, when you are bigger you have these systems in place, and you do not have to guilt somebody into working a shift. If you need a shift filled, you have a stable of hundreds of caregivers you can reach out to, it is just a matter of how much bonus you have to put on it.These rhetorical strategies demonstrate how technologists draw on multiple moral frameworks to present their work as solutions to different problems.Building on discussions of CareTech’s organizational strategy,technologists most concretely articulated their efforts toward ‘im-proving care in society’ through labor management. They started these discussions by problematizing caregiver job quality under legacy home care practices as associated with low wages, few ben-efits, rigid scheduling practices, and little recognition of caregivers efforts. Kennedy critiqued legacy staffing practices on the grounds of fairness and transparency:There’s a lot of favoritism that happens. There’s a lack of transparency. And so as you can imagine, the caregivers who work the most shifts, they’re able to earn the most amount of money. And that’s really helping to improve their lives and livelihoods. Other technologists framed algorithmic staffing as a solution to the legacy staffing practices that Kennedy identified as opaque and unfair. While Kennedy incorporated concerns about material well-being into her critiques, other technologists generally avoided discussing their efforts toward increasing caregiver job quality in terms of a market-based moral framework. This may have resulted from the market constraints of care, where the price for private pay home care is inaccessible for many families. Aria explainedthat raising wages for caregivers would make the price of care“unpayable” by many clients. 4.1.3 Professionalizing Care. Instead, technologists framed their efforts as attempts to improve caregivers’ status and provide them with a career. Aria noted that improving the collective status of caregivers was part of CareTech’s mission since its founding, em-phasizing challenging aspects of the job:I think that a really big piece of what CareTech is try-ing to do and has been trying to do since the beginning you know, elevate the profession of caregiving. Andtruly treat it a profession instead of just a job...because it's a difficult, emotionally intense, sometimes physi-cally intense thing to do.Floyd described further aspirations to elevate caregivers’ status through professionalization:I would say that [career] is a north star for us. I think everyone views that as an innovation that we can and should make, and the profession is worth it... we're working towards it, but we haven’t actually gotten there yet.These discussions highlight the links that technologists establish between different moral frameworks as they respond to a complex set of challenges. While they expressed concern about the value that care holds in society, increasing the pecuniary value of car was viewed as infeasible. Technologists responded to this problem by appealing to the status of the profession. However, technologists most defined solutions came in the form of staffing algorithms.4.2 Datafying CareWe unpack staffing practices at CareTech, which we argue are emblematic of technological solutionism. Our analysis reveals that technologists associated different aspects of staffing algorithms with different moral frameworks. We argue that how decisions are made about who is best suited for particular shifts—and why—is changing with the advent and implementation of algorithmic staffing tools as technologists prioritize efficiency. However, discussions with technologists show that there are tensions present in the use of algorithms. On the one hand, technologists discussed their work in terms of trying to increase caregiver performance. Performance Evaluation metrics break care into a set of constituent elements closely aligned with operational efficiency (an appeal to the indus-trial moral framework). On the other hand, technologists described their work as oriented toward establishing long-term relationships between caregivers and care recipients (an appeal to the domestic moral framework).The metrics and measurements that support algorithmic staffing practices are most closely associated with notions of productivity and operational efficiency. Technologists presented one part of their work as oriented toward increasing the “performance, or perceived performance of the caregiver” (Floyd). They described how this work is accomplished by measuring: (1) timeliness (how frequently a caregiver arrives to a shift on time); (2) consistency (adherence to schedule shifts); (3) application usage (whether or not the caregiver uses the application to clock in to and out of shifts and evaluate care recipient well-being); and (4) call-offs (shifts not released seven days in advance). While this evaluation practice makes care legible based on a discrete set of metrics, the composition of these metrics is oriented toward operational efficiency rather than the experiences of care recipients or care coordinators.Technologists contrasted their work with platforms in the ride-hailing industry7, describing how their work was motivated by the desire to establish long-term relationships between caregivers and care recipients. They referenced algorithms in terms that framed care as a holistic practice, often comparing the product of their work to other intimate relationships. Staffing algorithms have a role at two main sites: as initial schedules were made and when other caregivers called off their shifts. When caregivers are scheduled during their onboarding, staff members at CareTech use algorithmic recommendation systems to match caregivers with care recipients.In both cases, platform architects compared the matching process to other intimate relations between caregivers and care recipients.In Sandra’s words: Once the data are all collected, [the algorithm] gives us a list of caregivers, and it was ranked by most likely to be picked up by the caregiver...there is a...I don't want to say negotiating, but there are conversations that go back and forth. Because it does become an arranged marriage when you’re putting it inside thehome.In instances where shifts opened up with clients, the platform gives caregivers the option to pick up shifts with these clients through a user interface that Floyd described as “not not tinder 8 inspired. In advancing these relationship-based arguments, technologists define quality care by referencing domestic relationships between caregivers and care recipients.On the one hand, technologists seek to build a platform that effi-ciently delivers consistent care to a growing number of older adult care recipients. On the other, they describe their work as motivated by a desire to optimize relationships between caregivers and care recipients. At the same time, they framed their efforts as improving fairness, accountability, and transparency in staffing practices. Pair-ing discussions of metrics—which break care down into constituent elements associated with industrial efficiency—with algorithms staffing practices—which technologists use to frame evaluation in domestic terms—reveals that these actors associate different parts of their job with distinct moral frameworks to meet a complex set of demands. Further, interviews with caregivers and coordinators reveal that these performance evaluation criteria and platform staffing practices are a source of tension and stress.4.3 Platform AsymmetriesWhat are the consequences of technologists’ actions? To answer this question, we turn to platform caregivers’ and care coordinators’ per-spectives and experiences. Contrary to technologists’ aspirations touse algorithms to build a fairer, more transparent order, algorithmic staffing practices in fact created new conditions of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. First, we focus on evaluation practices.CareTech’s app for caregivers displays ratings across several met-rics related to operational aspects of care delivery (i.e., timeliness,consistency, application usage, and call-offs). The platform also sends weekly caregiver evaluation surveys to coordinators but does not share this feedback directly with caregivers. Further, caregivers rarely received qualitative feedback regarding the quality of care they provided. Caregivers discussed how these aspects of platform design contributed to ambiguity regarding insight into their perfor-mance, while coordinators approached completing survey-based caregiver evaluations with ambivalence. Second, we analyze care-givers’ interactions with CareTech’s staffing practices. Caregivers described experiencing collapsed boundaries between working and personal time. Despite these new challenges, the caregivers and coordinators we interviewed did not mention a desire to leave. .4.3.1 Ambiguity and Ambivalence. While caregivers described providing care as meaningful and were generally content with the conditions they faced on the platform, they discussed a lack of clarity regarding expectations and performance. As Hayden said:I believe that the clients, they also rate us after every shift. So then if we get rated lowly every time or pretty consistently, I’m sure they will reach out tous...I don’t know that it helps us rate our care and how well we’re doing with our clients, but I don't know how else they could do that...you hear stories of people who are dissatisfied with their care, and that's hard to tell.It was only after connecting with other caregivers that Hayden Learned that it was possible to request a performance evaluation form CareTech. Further, the opacity of metrics created feelings of worry for care-givers about their performance. As a new caregiver on the platform,Hazel worried about a low client consistency rating and discussed needing to take the initiative to understand why she received low ratings across other metrics. Puzzled about low application usage ratings, Hazel described needing to reach out to CareTech to understand “what [she] was missing.” CareTech’s communication and evaluation practices created unclear situations with multiple interpretations and required additional labor on the part of caregivers to understand how care recipients experienced their care and how the platform judged their performance. Coordinators, on the other hand, discussed their own evaluation practices as infused with ambivalence—a finding that we found surprising given the intimate and impactful context of care for an older loved one. While coordinators described clear feelings about the care provided to loved ones, our interviewees responded to CareTech’s evaluation surveys inconsistently. Coordinators expressed satisfaction with the care that caregivers provided and thus did not feel a need to fill out the company’s weekly care-giver evaluation survey, described how these surveys were not as useful compared to in-person evaluations performed over more extended periods, or expressed that they did not feel their feedback through these outlets was listened to by CareTech. Phyllis—who lives with her care recipient—described that since the quality of care was so consistent, there was not a need to be very detailed in her evaluations: “they will send out those [surveys] weekly...soyou click on attentiveness, preparation, and I don’t remember what they all are. There’s about five of them. I don’t get very detailed.” On The other hand, Brooks—who did not live with his care recipient,and was dissatisfied with the consistency of staffing provided byCareTech—described feeling overwhelmed by the amount of eval-uating he was asked to do: “For each one of the caregivers that has been in, they’re asking for an opinion for eight to 10 caregivers everyMonday, on the same thing, the same people doing the same thing.I’ve had a hard time seeing the value on a weekly basis.” He saw more value in evaluations carried out over longer intervals as it had been before the acquisition. There used to be the quarterly report where they would actually go in and visit and come back and say,‘this has changed, or this looks like it’s changed’...when someone steps in four or five times a year those are the ones that can pick out some things.Opal, who uses CareTech to provide care to her husband, discussed her attitude towards the surveys: “Honestly, I ignore [the surveys]. It’s not something I want to do. I don’t know why. I know they're doing great.” These perspectives demonstrate a difference in the worth actors ascribed to particular evaluation practices, high-lighting a mismatch between technologists’, coordinators’, and care-givers’ perspectives. Other coordinators described non-use of CareTech’s evaluation infrastructure, even when there were striking departures from care expectations. Coordinators justified their approach by appealing to different moral frameworks. Riley said, “what did happen onetime, and I should probably be more tuned into it...there was one day when one of the caregivers didn’t show up at all. And I didn't know about it until the next day.” She justified the non-use through appeals to a domestic moral framework: “I’m not as hands-on, I’mnot looking at the app to see what they’re doing. I get my feedback on how they’re doing from my mom and dad.” Winnie, who relied on a caregiver to transport her mother to church on Sunday mornings, described situations where sometimes a caregiver assigned to the shift couldn’t drive or had no car. Even so, she did not fill out regular surveys, drawing on her experience as a business owner (industrial)to express that she understood the challenges of staffing shifts: “it’sa very hard thing to maneuver in the world that we’re walking in. We Own a small business. We employ 13 ladies, so I understand.” At the same time, she seemed to negatively moralize non-use: “I will be honest with you that a survey has come...I haven’t filled it out. So I Haven't done due diligence on my part. You know, so I’m going to own that part.” While some coordinators expressed frustration about consistency, communication, quality, and the efficacy of evaluation practices, they appealed to multiple moral frameworks to justify different uses of evaluation infrastructure.4.3.2 Work Practices and Professional Boundaries. Continued dis-cussion with caregivers provided insight into how the problems that technologists faced contributed to aspects of platform design.The need to fill open shifts and coordinate care work across multiple individuals—associated with an industrial moral framework—took precedence over other concerns. Francine’s account of interactions with CareTech provides an example of how the need to staff shifts devalued communication about performance: “they have never given me any feedback or evaluation, the only time they call is about the schedule, asking if you can work more.” We argue that technologists prioritization of needs associated with the industrial moral frame-work eroded the boundary between caregivers’ work and personal lives and changed care practices.For example, the platform uses a notification system to bring open shifts to caregivers’ attention. However, Pepper describe how the constant notification stream makes it difficult for her to differentiate between work and leisure time:I can tell they have a lot of shifts to fill in. Am I go-ing to be under pressure? They’ve asked me for five things, and you said no to all of them, it feels likeI should say yes to something now. It’s just a little harder to be either working or not working...when you see your phone in the morning and you see all those notifications there.Hayden described receiving “30 to 40” notifications a day from the app, even after reaching out to CareTech to express that they would not work any more shifts. Further, they described confu-sion and frustration regarding the processes by which shifts were initially assigned:I actually said no to [the shift], but they scheduled me anyway. Which was how I got a lot of my shifts,which was okay...I know sometimes it sounds weird,but I would say no to a shift, maybe they’d think thatI said yes.This account suggests that the platform does not allow for as much flexibility as technologists imagine.In contrast to legacy record-keeping procedures, where care-givers left paper-based care notes in clients’ homes, CareTech’splatform requires that caregivers describe their shifts upon clock-ing out in an electronic journal that is viewable by coordinators and other caregivers. While caregivers described that the journal helped them feel more prepared for each shift, they also described reading journal entries outside of working hours, which provided further evidence for blurred boundaries between work and personal life.For example, Chauncey described reading entries “at night, before Igo to bed, I start reading if I’m going to work the next morning.” In Addition, platform architecture requiring caregivers to complete these logs changed caregivers’ relationship to time spent on the job. Francine described how filling out the notes, especially in the time-sensitive context of a shift, placed pressure on how she spent time providing care: “if you clock out right at a minute after [your shift ends] they get you on that.” Efforts to avoid disciplinary action created new relationships to time: “I just always try to clock out a few minutes before because you get all these questions before closing out the app” (Francine). In these cases, platform architecture changed caregivers' relationships with their time both on and off the clock,which put caregivers under additional pressure.We found that aspects of platform and algorithm design create new forms of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. We argue that this results from a mismatch between technologists’ moral reasoning and that of other platform actors. In addition, the need to fill open shifts and coordinate work across many individuals pri-oritizes a logic of efficiency over concerns for caregiver job quality.Despite coordinators’ unmet expectations and new pressures that the platform placed on caregivers, both sets of actors maintain a commitment to the platform.

After several interviews, one researcher visitedStayHome’s global headquarters and a company-owned agency,located in a major Midwestern city in the U.S. The researcher toured the company’s offices and met with support staff. In addition, theresearcher engaged these actors in informal conversations to learn how StayHome and CareTech operate. To understand how the plat-form is presented to caregivers and what aspects of paid care work are emphasized, the researcher observed a caregiver training ses-sion on lifting and transferring techniques at one of StayHome’scompany-owned franchises and attended a virtual onboarding ses-sion with CareTech in the afternoon.We developed the interview guide with interest in valuation and evaluation practices as they occur on CareTech’s platform. Treating valuation as a moral outlook, we drew on practice-oriented approaches to understanding how different actors conceptualize and contribute value in labor contexts [36]. Examining the practices of the people that develop platforms and those who are subject to their architecture provides an opportunity to identify the underlying justifications and actions that shape and transform care work as it occurs on the ground. Interview questions thus sought to elicit interviewees' daily practices, what elements of their work they described as most important, the least favorite aspects of their work,and their ideological orientation towards the concept of ‘care.’After obtaining consent, we recorded the interviews, which lasted between 45 and 90 minutes and took place mainly over Zoom. However, we did interview several caregivers and one coordinator in person. Team members iteratively refined these themes through discussion and mapped them to the EoW framework. We used a third-party qualitative coding tool (NVivo) to complete the coding process. To make theoretical sense of the data, we returned to the literature and iterated between data and extant research. Our findings indicate that technologists drew on several economies of worth—which we refer to as moral frameworks—to navigate the seemingly irreconcilable demands of home care. They referenced multiple interpretations of the term ‘care’ to resolve contradictions.We illustrate this point by first focusing on how technologists described the problems that they claim to solve. Then, we analyze the nature of the solutions they presented, highlighting how technolo-gists imbued different aspects of algorithm design and function with moral meanings. This finding demonstrates the interpretive flexibil-ity of technological artifacts. Finally, we turn to the perspectives of caregivers and coordinators. Their accounts show how algorithmic staffing practices created new forms of uncertainty—the mirror of technologists' stated intentions.4.1 Navigating Contextual ComplexityTechnologists drew on multiple moral frameworks to navigate expectations and demands, appealing to various interpretations of care’ to reconcile the contradictory pressures they face. The technologists we interviewed framed CareTech as a platform developed to address traditional home care agencies’ logistical and opera-tional challenges. In this context, they appealed to an industrial moral framework, framing their work as introducing greater levels of efficiency and rationalization to the home care industry. How-ever, many of the technologists we interviewed also framed their work in terms of a civic moral framework, critiquing prior staffing practices as subjective, opaque, unfair, and harmful to the material well-being of caregivers. Although these two narratives may appear contradictory, technologists unified these demands by appealing to the societal need for more care. For example, improvements inefficiency were discussed in terms of increasing the affordability of care while improving working conditions was imagined as growing the size of the caregiving workforce. We argue that technologists navigate complexity when creating and developing care algorithms by strategically appealing to justifications corresponding to differ-ent moral frameworks, drawing on multiple interpretations of a single term to move between them. Throughout this section, we draw attention to how technologists position algorithmic staffing practices as one solution to the problems they described.4.1.1 Platform Description & Motivations. The rhetoric that tech-nologists and company executives used to describe their motivation for building the platform appealed to domestic and social goods. In press releases and on the company website, CareTech’s execu-tives described their frustrations in searching for care for their own parents. Similarly, technologists invoked ideas of familial respon-sibility, relaying stories about their difficulties in finding care for aging parents. Technologists also drew on more civic-oriented no-tions of good, framing their work with reference to positive social change. For example, Richard described, “being part of something that can have a positive impact on society.” The company’s mission statement, was described as ‘improving care in society6, highlight-ing the significance of a single moral concept in technologists discourse.In discussing the company’s strategy, the technologists we in-terviewed described CareTech as a “platform,” “communication company,” or “logistical engine,”, foregrounding CareTech’s use of digital technology to improve efficiency, and framed their work asa response to logistical challenges in the home care industry. Aiden described what he framed as the company’s main value proposition:I think the big sort of sell is, it is getting harder and harder to operate care. I think it is getting more expensive...the core value proposition is where we are trying to figure out how to build a platform around doing this, and helping agencies focus more on their relationships with their communities and customers.He elaborated that, by centralizing operations, CareTech offers partner agencies relief from work that is “consuming and grueling,whether it’s paperwork, management, documentation, staffing, lo-gistics, or being on call all the time.” By filling this role, CareTech‘frees up agencies to both source customers and maintain that rela-tionship and kind of connection’ (Aiden). Repeated references to the relationship between CareTech and the agencies with which it partners serve two purposes. First, they identify areas whereCareTech uses technology to increase efficiency in the home care industry. This problem formulation provides the background for how organizational solutions are framed. Second, they format a division of labor. In this account, partner agencies are positioned as responsible for managing relationships in local markets, while the platform oversees aspects of labor control and management.Here, technologists frame the platform’s work in industrial terms and partner agencies in domestic terms. 4.1.2 Staffing Practices as Solutions. As they justified their work,technologists also blended elements from multiple moral frame-works. Specifically, they simultaneously appealed to notions of market dominance and civic responsibility. This overlap materialized as Robert, a data scientist, stated that the company’s scale offered a ‘unified view across markets’ and provided access to a sufficient amount of data to use statistical techniques to ‘learn from the data to provide better home care’, serving as a “competitive dif-ferentiator in the market.” In addition, Floyd framed the company's size as affording more ‘careful’ staffing practice:From a systemic perspective, when you are bigger you have these systems in place, and you do not have to guilt somebody into working a shift. If you need a shift filled, you have a stable of hundreds of caregivers you can reach out to, it is just a matter of how much bonus you have to put on it.These rhetorical strategies demonstrate how technologists draw on multiple moral frameworks to present their work as solutions to different problems.Building on discussions of CareTech’s organizational strategy,technologists most concretely articulated their efforts toward ‘im-proving care in society’ through labor management. They started these discussions by problematizing caregiver job quality under legacy home care practices as associated with low wages, few ben-efits, rigid scheduling practices, and little recognition of caregivers efforts. Kennedy critiqued legacy staffing practices on the grounds of fairness and transparency:There’s a lot of favoritism that happens. There’s a lack of transparency. And so as you can imagine, the caregivers who work the most shifts, they’re able to earn the most amount of money. And that’s really helping to improve their lives and livelihoods. Other technologists framed algorithmic staffing as a solution to the legacy staffing practices that Kennedy identified as opaque and unfair. While Kennedy incorporated concerns about material well-being into her critiques, other technologists generally avoided discussing their efforts toward increasing caregiver job quality in terms of a market-based moral framework. This may have resulted from the market constraints of care, where the price for private pay home care is inaccessible for many families. Aria explainedthat raising wages for caregivers would make the price of care“unpayable” by many clients. 4.1.3 Professionalizing Care. Instead, technologists framed their efforts as attempts to improve caregivers’ status and provide them with a career. Aria noted that improving the collective status of caregivers was part of CareTech’s mission since its founding, em-phasizing challenging aspects of the job:I think that a really big piece of what CareTech is try-ing to do and has been trying to do since the beginning you know, elevate the profession of caregiving. Andtruly treat it a profession instead of just a job...because it's a difficult, emotionally intense, sometimes physi-cally intense thing to do.Floyd described further aspirations to elevate caregivers’ status through professionalization:I would say that [career] is a north star for us. I think everyone views that as an innovation that we can and should make, and the profession is worth it... we're working towards it, but we haven’t actually gotten there yet.These discussions highlight the links that technologists establish between different moral frameworks as they respond to a complex set of challenges. While they expressed concern about the value that care holds in society, increasing the pecuniary value of car was viewed as infeasible. Technologists responded to this problem by appealing to the status of the profession. However, technologists most defined solutions came in the form of staffing algorithms.4.2 Datafying CareWe unpack staffing practices at CareTech, which we argue are emblematic of technological solutionism. Our analysis reveals that technologists associated different aspects of staffing algorithms with different moral frameworks. We argue that how decisions are made about who is best suited for particular shifts—and why—is changing with the advent and implementation of algorithmic staffing tools as technologists prioritize efficiency. However, discussions with technologists show that there are tensions present in the use of algorithms. On the one hand, technologists discussed their work in terms of trying to increase caregiver performance. Performance Evaluation metrics break care into a set of constituent elements closely aligned with operational efficiency (an appeal to the indus-trial moral framework). On the other hand, technologists described their work as oriented toward establishing long-term relationships between caregivers and care recipients (an appeal to the domestic moral framework).The metrics and measurements that support algorithmic staffing practices are most closely associated with notions of productivity and operational efficiency. Technologists presented one part of their work as oriented toward increasing the “performance, or perceived performance of the caregiver” (Floyd). They described how this work is accomplished by measuring: (1) timeliness (how frequently a caregiver arrives to a shift on time); (2) consistency (adherence to schedule shifts); (3) application usage (whether or not the caregiver uses the application to clock in to and out of shifts and evaluate care recipient well-being); and (4) call-offs (shifts not released seven days in advance). While this evaluation practice makes care legible based on a discrete set of metrics, the composition of these metrics is oriented toward operational efficiency rather than the experiences of care recipients or care coordinators.Technologists contrasted their work with platforms in the ride-hailing industry7, describing how their work was motivated by the desire to establish long-term relationships between caregivers and care recipients. They referenced algorithms in terms that framed care as a holistic practice, often comparing the product of their work to other intimate relationships. Staffing algorithms have a role at two main sites: as initial schedules were made and when other caregivers called off their shifts. When caregivers are scheduled during their onboarding, staff members at CareTech use algorithmic recommendation systems to match caregivers with care recipients.In both cases, platform architects compared the matching process to other intimate relations between caregivers and care recipients.In Sandra’s words: Once the data are all collected, [the algorithm] gives us a list of caregivers, and it was ranked by most likely to be picked up by the caregiver...there is a...I don't want to say negotiating, but there are conversations that go back and forth. Because it does become an arranged marriage when you’re putting it inside thehome.In instances where shifts opened up with clients, the platform gives caregivers the option to pick up shifts with these clients through a user interface that Floyd described as “not not tinder 8 inspired. In advancing these relationship-based arguments, technologists define quality care by referencing domestic relationships between caregivers and care recipients.On the one hand, technologists seek to build a platform that effi-ciently delivers consistent care to a growing number of older adult care recipients. On the other, they describe their work as motivated by a desire to optimize relationships between caregivers and care recipients. At the same time, they framed their efforts as improving fairness, accountability, and transparency in staffing practices. Pair-ing discussions of metrics—which break care down into constituent elements associated with industrial efficiency—with algorithms staffing practices—which technologists use to frame evaluation in domestic terms—reveals that these actors associate different parts of their job with distinct moral frameworks to meet a complex set of demands. Further, interviews with caregivers and coordinators reveal that these performance evaluation criteria and platform staffing practices are a source of tension and stress.4.3 Platform AsymmetriesWhat are the consequences of technologists’ actions? To answer this question, we turn to platform caregivers’ and care coordinators’ per-spectives and experiences. Contrary to technologists’ aspirations touse algorithms to build a fairer, more transparent order, algorithmic staffing practices in fact created new conditions of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. First, we focus on evaluation practices.CareTech’s app for caregivers displays ratings across several met-rics related to operational aspects of care delivery (i.e., timeliness,consistency, application usage, and call-offs). The platform also sends weekly caregiver evaluation surveys to coordinators but does not share this feedback directly with caregivers. Further, caregivers rarely received qualitative feedback regarding the quality of care they provided. Caregivers discussed how these aspects of platform design contributed to ambiguity regarding insight into their perfor-mance, while coordinators approached completing survey-based caregiver evaluations with ambivalence. Second, we analyze care-givers’ interactions with CareTech’s staffing practices. Caregivers described experiencing collapsed boundaries between working and personal time. Despite these new challenges, the caregivers and coordinators we interviewed did not mention a desire to leave. .4.3.1 Ambiguity and Ambivalence. While caregivers described providing care as meaningful and were generally content with the conditions they faced on the platform, they discussed a lack of clarity regarding expectations and performance. As Hayden said:I believe that the clients, they also rate us after every shift. So then if we get rated lowly every time or pretty consistently, I’m sure they will reach out tous...I don’t know that it helps us rate our care and how well we’re doing with our clients, but I don't know how else they could do that...you hear stories of people who are dissatisfied with their care, and that's hard to tell.It was only after connecting with other caregivers that Hayden Learned that it was possible to request a performance evaluation form CareTech. Further, the opacity of metrics created feelings of worry for care-givers about their performance. As a new caregiver on the platform,Hazel worried about a low client consistency rating and discussed needing to take the initiative to understand why she received low ratings across other metrics. Puzzled about low application usage ratings, Hazel described needing to reach out to CareTech to understand “what [she] was missing.” CareTech’s communication and evaluation practices created unclear situations with multiple interpretations and required additional labor on the part of caregivers to understand how care recipients experienced their care and how the platform judged their performance. Coordinators, on the other hand, discussed their own evaluation practices as infused with ambivalence—a finding that we found surprising given the intimate and impactful context of care for an older loved one. While coordinators described clear feelings about the care provided to loved ones, our interviewees responded to CareTech’s evaluation surveys inconsistently. Coordinators expressed satisfaction with the care that caregivers provided and thus did not feel a need to fill out the company’s weekly care-giver evaluation survey, described how these surveys were not as useful compared to in-person evaluations performed over more extended periods, or expressed that they did not feel their feedback through these outlets was listened to by CareTech. Phyllis—who lives with her care recipient—described that since the quality of care was so consistent, there was not a need to be very detailed in her evaluations: “they will send out those [surveys] weekly...soyou click on attentiveness, preparation, and I don’t remember what they all are. There’s about five of them. I don’t get very detailed.” On The other hand, Brooks—who did not live with his care recipient,and was dissatisfied with the consistency of staffing provided byCareTech—described feeling overwhelmed by the amount of eval-uating he was asked to do: “For each one of the caregivers that has been in, they’re asking for an opinion for eight to 10 caregivers everyMonday, on the same thing, the same people doing the same thing.I’ve had a hard time seeing the value on a weekly basis.” He saw more value in evaluations carried out over longer intervals as it had been before the acquisition. There used to be the quarterly report where they would actually go in and visit and come back and say,‘this has changed, or this looks like it’s changed’...when someone steps in four or five times a year those are the ones that can pick out some things.Opal, who uses CareTech to provide care to her husband, discussed her attitude towards the surveys: “Honestly, I ignore [the surveys]. It’s not something I want to do. I don’t know why. I know they're doing great.” These perspectives demonstrate a difference in the worth actors ascribed to particular evaluation practices, high-lighting a mismatch between technologists’, coordinators’, and care-givers’ perspectives. Other coordinators described non-use of CareTech’s evaluation infrastructure, even when there were striking departures from care expectations. Coordinators justified their approach by appealing to different moral frameworks. Riley said, “what did happen onetime, and I should probably be more tuned into it...there was one day when one of the caregivers didn’t show up at all. And I didn't know about it until the next day.” She justified the non-use through appeals to a domestic moral framework: “I’m not as hands-on, I’mnot looking at the app to see what they’re doing. I get my feedback on how they’re doing from my mom and dad.” Winnie, who relied on a caregiver to transport her mother to church on Sunday mornings, described situations where sometimes a caregiver assigned to the shift couldn’t drive or had no car. Even so, she did not fill out regular surveys, drawing on her experience as a business owner (industrial)to express that she understood the challenges of staffing shifts: “it’sa very hard thing to maneuver in the world that we’re walking in. We Own a small business. We employ 13 ladies, so I understand.” At the same time, she seemed to negatively moralize non-use: “I will be honest with you that a survey has come...I haven’t filled it out. So I Haven't done due diligence on my part. You know, so I’m going to own that part.” While some coordinators expressed frustration about consistency, communication, quality, and the efficacy of evaluation practices, they appealed to multiple moral frameworks to justify different uses of evaluation infrastructure.4.3.2 Work Practices and Professional Boundaries. Continued dis-cussion with caregivers provided insight into how the problems that technologists faced contributed to aspects of platform design.The need to fill open shifts and coordinate care work across multiple individuals—associated with an industrial moral framework—took precedence over other concerns. Francine’s account of interactions with CareTech provides an example of how the need to staff shifts devalued communication about performance: “they have never given me any feedback or evaluation, the only time they call is about the schedule, asking if you can work more.” We argue that technologists prioritization of needs associated with the industrial moral frame-work eroded the boundary between caregivers’ work and personal lives and changed care practices.For example, the platform uses a notification system to bring open shifts to caregivers’ attention. However, Pepper describe how the constant notification stream makes it difficult for her to differentiate between work and leisure time:I can tell they have a lot of shifts to fill in. Am I go-ing to be under pressure? They’ve asked me for five things, and you said no to all of them, it feels likeI should say yes to something now. It’s just a little harder to be either working or not working...when you see your phone in the morning and you see all those notifications there.Hayden described receiving “30 to 40” notifications a day from the app, even after reaching out to CareTech to express that they would not work any more shifts. Further, they described confu-sion and frustration regarding the processes by which shifts were initially assigned:I actually said no to [the shift], but they scheduled me anyway. Which was how I got a lot of my shifts,which was okay...I know sometimes it sounds weird,but I would say no to a shift, maybe they’d think thatI said yes.This account suggests that the platform does not allow for as much flexibility as technologists imagine.In contrast to legacy record-keeping procedures, where care-givers left paper-based care notes in clients’ homes, CareTech’splatform requires that caregivers describe their shifts upon clock-ing out in an electronic journal that is viewable by coordinators and other caregivers. While caregivers described that the journal helped them feel more prepared for each shift, they also described reading journal entries outside of working hours, which provided further evidence for blurred boundaries between work and personal life.For example, Chauncey described reading entries “at night, before Igo to bed, I start reading if I’m going to work the next morning.” In Addition, platform architecture requiring caregivers to complete these logs changed caregivers’ relationship to time spent on the job. Francine described how filling out the notes, especially in the time-sensitive context of a shift, placed pressure on how she spent time providing care: “if you clock out right at a minute after [your shift ends] they get you on that.” Efforts to avoid disciplinary action created new relationships to time: “I just always try to clock out a few minutes before because you get all these questions before closing out the app” (Francine). In these cases, platform architecture changed caregivers' relationships with their time both on and off the clock,which put caregivers under additional pressure.We found that aspects of platform and algorithm design create new forms of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. We argue that this results from a mismatch between technologists’ moral reasoning and that of other platform actors. In addition, the need to fill open shifts and coordinate work across many individuals pri-oritizes a logic of efficiency over concerns for caregiver job quality.Despite coordinators’ unmet expectations and new pressures that the platform placed on caregivers, both sets of actors maintain a commitment to the platform. A possible explanation for contin-ued attachment is the moral significance of ‘care.’ While the term carries various meanings across actors and situations, it may act as a resource that maintains a particular status quo by mitigating organized critique of or departure from the platform.

39,Caregivers,hasProducedArtifact,Interviews,"The subject of our case study, CareTech4, is one of several start-upsthat are credited with “reinventing the [home care] agency model”[22]. Prior to data collection, CareTech acquired StayHome, a traditional home care agency franchise. To contextualize our findings,we briefly discuss CareTech’s business model.CareTech partners with traditional home care agencies to support back-end administrative, legal, compliance, and logistics functions in exchange for a share of partner agencies’ revenue, employing caregivers directly. Caregivers assist with activities of daily living(i.e., bathing, dressing, getting in or out of a bed or chair, walking,using the toilet, eating) [43], and instrumental activities of daily living (i.e., cooking, cleaning, transportation, laundry, managing finances) [46]. CareTech’s use of algorithms to match caregivers to care recipients is central to our case. When we started data collection, CareTech’s technology platform had recently been im-plemented at StayHome’s company-owned agencies, providing a unique opportunity to investigate care algorithm implementation.In this paper, we focus primarily on CareTech’s staffing prac-tices. CareTech uses metrics and algorithms, along with human management, to staff shifts. Staffing algorithms have a role at two main sites: as initial schedules were made and when other care-givers called off their shifts. When caregivers are scheduled during their onboarding, staff members at CareTech use algorithmic recommendation systems to match caregivers with care recipients. Evaluation metrics (i.e., timeliness, consistency, application usage,and call-offs), along with other data (e.g., caregiver commute time,number of complaints) are used to match caregivers and care recipients. Coordinators receive weekly surveys about the quality of care provided, and provide responses on a linear scale5. After IRB approval, we recruited participants—technologists (n =14), caregivers (n = 9), and coordinators (n = 7)—through a partnership with CareTech and StayHome for interviews using convenience and purposive sampling [10]. StayHome’s research staff arranged site visit and helped recruit participants. We provided a brief description of the study and a screening questionnaire distributed amongst the caregivers and coordinators over email. This approach provided an opportunity to learn from technologists, caregivers,coordinators who were enthusiastic about sharing their experi-ences with the platform. Table 2 and table 3 provide an overview of participant profiles.(1) Technologists: Technologists consisted of software engi-neers, designers, product managers, and data and opera-tions workers. Software engineers talked about buildingCareTech’s features and the company’s history. Designers Develop CareTech’s front-end user experience for caregivers.Designers, the operations team, and a product manager described how they approached curating the caregiver experi-ence. The data scientists, data analysts, and data stewards dis-cussed the metrics used to measure caregiver performance,the data that staffing algorithms use, and how algorithms work in practice.(2) Caregivers: We use the term ‘caregivers’ to refer to the people employed by CareTech to provide care for pay.(3) Coordinators: The term ‘coordinators’ refers to people that pay for CareTech’s services and coordinate their delivery,usually on behalf of an older loved one. Recruiting interview participants through a partnership with Stay-Home and CareTech potentially biased results toward more positive perspectives of organizational practices. Caregivers and coordina-tors with more negative views about the company may have been reluctant to share their opinions or participate in interviews alto-gether due to fears of retaliation from the platform. Convenience Sampling limited the extent to which we were able to understand differences across demographic subgroups. Future work should explore this issue. Further, recruitment overlooked the perspectives of care coordinators and caregivers who have left the platform due to difficulties This study draws on data gathered from one week of observations performed in July 2022 and 30 interviews conducted between May2022 and August 2022. We conducted in-depth interviews to understand the cultural inputs that shape algorithm design and the implications for caregivers and coordinators. Interviews are well-suited for understanding social dimensions of how people interpret the world and take actions based on those interpretations [64]. Interviews with technology workers show how they make sense of their work and build systems [67], and interviews with caregivers and coordinators show that care practices diverge from organizational philosophy [53]. After several interviews, one researcher visitedStayHome’s global headquarters and a company-owned agency,located in a major Midwestern city in the U.S. The researcher toured the company’s offices and met with support staff.

Andtruly treat it a profession instead of just a job...because it's a difficult, emotionally intense, sometimes physi-cally intense thing to do.Floyd described further aspirations to elevate caregivers’ status through professionalization:I would say that [career] is a north star for us. I think everyone views that as an innovation that we can and should make, and the profession is worth it... we're working towards it, but we haven’t actually gotten there yet.These discussions highlight the links that technologists establish between different moral frameworks as they respond to a complex set of challenges. While they expressed concern about the value that care holds in society, increasing the pecuniary value of car was viewed as infeasible. Technologists responded to this problem by appealing to the status of the profession. However, technologists most defined solutions came in the form of staffing algorithms.4.2 Datafying CareWe unpack staffing practices at CareTech, which we argue are emblematic of technological solutionism. Our analysis reveals that technologists associated different aspects of staffing algorithms with different moral frameworks. We argue that how decisions are made about who is best suited for particular shifts—and why—is changing with the advent and implementation of algorithmic staffing tools as technologists prioritize efficiency. However, discussions with technologists show that there are tensions present in the use of algorithms. On the one hand, technologists discussed their work in terms of trying to increase caregiver performance. Performance Evaluation metrics break care into a set of constituent elements closely aligned with operational efficiency (an appeal to the indus-trial moral framework). On the other hand, technologists described their work as oriented toward establishing long-term relationships between caregivers and care recipients (an appeal to the domestic moral framework).The metrics and measurements that support algorithmic staffing practices are most closely associated with notions of productivity and operational efficiency. Technologists presented one part of their work as oriented toward increasing the “performance, or perceived performance of the caregiver” (Floyd). They described how this work is accomplished by measuring: (1) timeliness (how frequently a caregiver arrives to a shift on time); (2) consistency (adherence to schedule shifts); (3) application usage (whether or not the caregiver uses the application to clock in to and out of shifts and evaluate care recipient well-being); and (4) call-offs (shifts not released seven days in advance). While this evaluation practice makes care legible based on a discrete set of metrics, the composition of these metrics is oriented toward operational efficiency rather than the experiences of care recipients or care coordinators.Technologists contrasted their work with platforms in the ride-hailing industry7, describing how their work was motivated by the desire to establish long-term relationships between caregivers and care recipients. They referenced algorithms in terms that framed care as a holistic practice, often comparing the product of their work to other intimate relationships. Staffing algorithms have a role at two main sites: as initial schedules were made and when other caregivers called off their shifts. When caregivers are scheduled during their onboarding, staff members at CareTech use algorithmic recommendation systems to match caregivers with care recipients.In both cases, platform architects compared the matching process to other intimate relations between caregivers and care recipients.In Sandra’s words: Once the data are all collected, [the algorithm] gives us a list of caregivers, and it was ranked by most likely to be picked up by the caregiver...there is a...I don't want to say negotiating, but there are conversations that go back and forth. Because it does become an arranged marriage when you’re putting it inside thehome.In instances where shifts opened up with clients, the platform gives caregivers the option to pick up shifts with these clients through a user interface that Floyd described as “not not tinder 8 inspired. In advancing these relationship-based arguments, technologists define quality care by referencing domestic relationships between caregivers and care recipients.On the one hand, technologists seek to build a platform that effi-ciently delivers consistent care to a growing number of older adult care recipients. On the other, they describe their work as motivated by a desire to optimize relationships between caregivers and care recipients. At the same time, they framed their efforts as improving fairness, accountability, and transparency in staffing practices. Pair-ing discussions of metrics—which break care down into constituent elements associated with industrial efficiency—with algorithms staffing practices—which technologists use to frame evaluation in domestic terms—reveals that these actors associate different parts of their job with distinct moral frameworks to meet a complex set of demands. Further, interviews with caregivers and coordinators reveal that these performance evaluation criteria and platform staffing practices are a source of tension and stress.4.3 Platform AsymmetriesWhat are the consequences of technologists’ actions? To answer this question, we turn to platform caregivers’ and care coordinators’ per-spectives and experiences. Contrary to technologists’ aspirations touse algorithms to build a fairer, more transparent order, algorithmic staffing practices in fact created new conditions of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. First, we focus on evaluation practices.CareTech’s app for caregivers displays ratings across several met-rics related to operational aspects of care delivery (i.e., timeliness,consistency, application usage, and call-offs). The platform also sends weekly caregiver evaluation surveys to coordinators but does not share this feedback directly with caregivers. Further, caregivers rarely received qualitative feedback regarding the quality of care they provided. Caregivers discussed how these aspects of platform design contributed to ambiguity regarding insight into their perfor-mance, while coordinators approached completing survey-based caregiver evaluations with ambivalence. Second, we analyze care-givers’ interactions with CareTech’s staffing practices. Caregivers described experiencing collapsed boundaries between working and personal time. Despite these new challenges, the caregivers and coordinators we interviewed did not mention a desire to leave. .4.3.1 Ambiguity and Ambivalence. While caregivers described providing care as meaningful and were generally content with the conditions they faced on the platform, they discussed a lack of clarity regarding expectations and performance. As Hayden said:I believe that the clients, they also rate us after every shift. So then if we get rated lowly every time or pretty consistently, I’m sure they will reach out tous...I don’t know that it helps us rate our care and how well we’re doing with our clients, but I don't know how else they could do that...you hear stories of people who are dissatisfied with their care, and that's hard to tell.It was only after connecting with other caregivers that Hayden Learned that it was possible to request a performance evaluation form CareTech. Further, the opacity of metrics created feelings of worry for care-givers about their performance. As a new caregiver on the platform,Hazel worried about a low client consistency rating and discussed needing to take the initiative to understand why she received low ratings across other metrics. Puzzled about low application usage ratings, Hazel described needing to reach out to CareTech to understand “what [she] was missing.” CareTech’s communication and evaluation practices created unclear situations with multiple interpretations and required additional labor on the part of caregivers to understand how care recipients experienced their care and how the platform judged their performance. Coordinators, on the other hand, discussed their own evaluation practices as infused with ambivalence—a finding that we found surprising given the intimate and impactful context of care for an older loved one. While coordinators described clear feelings about the care provided to loved ones, our interviewees responded to CareTech’s evaluation surveys inconsistently. Coordinators expressed satisfaction with the care that caregivers provided and thus did not feel a need to fill out the company’s weekly care-giver evaluation survey, described how these surveys were not as useful compared to in-person evaluations performed over more extended periods, or expressed that they did not feel their feedback through these outlets was listened to by CareTech. Phyllis—who lives with her care recipient—described that since the quality of care was so consistent, there was not a need to be very detailed in her evaluations: “they will send out those [surveys] weekly...soyou click on attentiveness, preparation, and I don’t remember what they all are. There’s about five of them. I don’t get very detailed.” On The other hand, Brooks—who did not live with his care recipient,and was dissatisfied with the consistency of staffing provided byCareTech—described feeling overwhelmed by the amount of eval-uating he was asked to do: “For each one of the caregivers that has been in, they’re asking for an opinion for eight to 10 caregivers everyMonday, on the same thing, the same people doing the same thing.I’ve had a hard time seeing the value on a weekly basis.” He saw more value in evaluations carried out over longer intervals as it had been before the acquisition. There used to be the quarterly report where they would actually go in and visit and come back and say,‘this has changed, or this looks like it’s changed’...when someone steps in four or five times a year those are the ones that can pick out some things.Opal, who uses CareTech to provide care to her husband, discussed her attitude towards the surveys: “Honestly, I ignore [the surveys]. It’s not something I want to do. I don’t know why. I know they're doing great.” These perspectives demonstrate a difference in the worth actors ascribed to particular evaluation practices, high-lighting a mismatch between technologists’, coordinators’, and care-givers’ perspectives. Other coordinators described non-use of CareTech’s evaluation infrastructure, even when there were striking departures from care expectations. Coordinators justified their approach by appealing to different moral frameworks. Riley said, “what did happen onetime, and I should probably be more tuned into it...there was one day when one of the caregivers didn’t show up at all. And I didn't know about it until the next day.” She justified the non-use through appeals to a domestic moral framework: “I’m not as hands-on, I’mnot looking at the app to see what they’re doing. I get my feedback on how they’re doing from my mom and dad.” Winnie, who relied on a caregiver to transport her mother to church on Sunday mornings, described situations where sometimes a caregiver assigned to the shift couldn’t drive or had no car. Even so, she did not fill out regular surveys, drawing on her experience as a business owner (industrial)to express that she understood the challenges of staffing shifts: “it’sa very hard thing to maneuver in the world that we’re walking in. We Own a small business. We employ 13 ladies, so I understand.” At the same time, she seemed to negatively moralize non-use: “I will be honest with you that a survey has come...I haven’t filled it out. So I Haven't done due diligence on my part. You know, so I’m going to own that part.” While some coordinators expressed frustration about consistency, communication, quality, and the efficacy of evaluation practices, they appealed to multiple moral frameworks to justify different uses of evaluation infrastructure.4.3.2 Work Practices and Professional Boundaries. Continued dis-cussion with caregivers provided insight into how the problems that technologists faced contributed to aspects of platform design.The need to fill open shifts and coordinate care work across multiple individuals—associated with an industrial moral framework—took precedence over other concerns. Francine’s account of interactions with CareTech provides an example of how the need to staff shifts devalued communication about performance: “they have never given me any feedback or evaluation, the only time they call is about the schedule, asking if you can work more.” We argue that technologists prioritization of needs associated with the industrial moral frame-work eroded the boundary between caregivers’ work and personal lives and changed care practices.For example, the platform uses a notification system to bring open shifts to caregivers’ attention. However, Pepper describe how the constant notification stream makes it difficult for her to differentiate between work and leisure time:I can tell they have a lot of shifts to fill in. Am I go-ing to be under pressure? They’ve asked me for five things, and you said no to all of them, it feels likeI should say yes to something now. It’s just a little harder to be either working or not working...when you see your phone in the morning and you see all those notifications there.Hayden described receiving “30 to 40” notifications a day from the app, even after reaching out to CareTech to express that they would not work any more shifts. Further, they described confu-sion and frustration regarding the processes by which shifts were initially assigned:I actually said no to [the shift], but they scheduled me anyway. Which was how I got a lot of my shifts,which was okay...I know sometimes it sounds weird,but I would say no to a shift, maybe they’d think thatI said yes.This account suggests that the platform does not allow for as much flexibility as technologists imagine.In contrast to legacy record-keeping procedures, where care-givers left paper-based care notes in clients’ homes, CareTech’splatform requires that caregivers describe their shifts upon clock-ing out in an electronic journal that is viewable by coordinators and other caregivers. While caregivers described that the journal helped them feel more prepared for each shift, they also described reading journal entries outside of working hours, which provided further evidence for blurred boundaries between work and personal life.For example, Chauncey described reading entries “at night, before Igo to bed, I start reading if I’m going to work the next morning.” In Addition, platform architecture requiring caregivers to complete these logs changed caregivers’ relationship to time spent on the job. Francine described how filling out the notes, especially in the time-sensitive context of a shift, placed pressure on how she spent time providing care: “if you clock out right at a minute after [your shift ends] they get you on that.” Efforts to avoid disciplinary action created new relationships to time: “I just always try to clock out a few minutes before because you get all these questions before closing out the app” (Francine). In these cases, platform architecture changed caregivers' relationships with their time both on and off the clock,which put caregivers under additional pressure.We found that aspects of platform and algorithm design create new forms of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. We argue that this results from a mismatch between technologists’ moral reasoning and that of other platform actors. In addition, the need to fill open shifts and coordinate work across many individuals pri-oritizes a logic of efficiency over concerns for caregiver job quality.Despite coordinators’ unmet expectations and new pressures that the platform placed on caregivers, both sets of actors maintain a commitment to the platform. A possible explanation for contin-ued attachment is the moral significance of ‘care.’ While the term carries various meanings across actors and situations, it may act as a resource that maintains a particular status quo by mitigating organized critique of or departure from the platform. ","629-30, 631-4",interviews with caregivers and coordinators
40,Coordinators,hasProducedArtifact,Interviews,"The subject of our case study, CareTech4, is one of several start-upsthat are credited with “reinventing the [home care] agency model”[22]. Prior to data collection, CareTech acquired StayHome, a traditional home care agency franchise. To contextualize our findings,we briefly discuss CareTech’s business model.CareTech partners with traditional home care agencies to support back-end administrative, legal, compliance, and logistics functions in exchange for a share of partner agencies’ revenue, employing caregivers directly. Caregivers assist with activities of daily living(i.e., bathing, dressing, getting in or out of a bed or chair, walking,using the toilet, eating) [43], and instrumental activities of daily living (i.e., cooking, cleaning, transportation, laundry, managing finances) [46]. CareTech’s use of algorithms to match caregivers to care recipients is central to our case. When we started data collection, CareTech’s technology platform had recently been im-plemented at StayHome’s company-owned agencies, providing a unique opportunity to investigate care algorithm implementation.In this paper, we focus primarily on CareTech’s staffing prac-tices. CareTech uses metrics and algorithms, along with human management, to staff shifts. Staffing algorithms have a role at two main sites: as initial schedules were made and when other care-givers called off their shifts. When caregivers are scheduled during their onboarding, staff members at CareTech use algorithmic recommendation systems to match caregivers with care recipients. Evaluation metrics (i.e., timeliness, consistency, application usage,and call-offs), along with other data (e.g., caregiver commute time,number of complaints) are used to match caregivers and care recipients. Coordinators receive weekly surveys about the quality of care provided, and provide responses on a linear scale5. After IRB approval, we recruited participants—technologists (n =14), caregivers (n = 9), and coordinators (n = 7)—through a partnership with CareTech and StayHome for interviews using convenience and purposive sampling [10]. StayHome’s research staff arranged site visit and helped recruit participants. We provided a brief description of the study and a screening questionnaire distributed amongst the caregivers and coordinators over email. This approach provided an opportunity to learn from technologists, caregivers,coordinators who were enthusiastic about sharing their experi-ences with the platform. Table 2 and table 3 provide an overview of participant profiles.(1) Technologists: Technologists consisted of software engi-neers, designers, product managers, and data and opera-tions workers. Software engineers talked about buildingCareTech’s features and the company’s history. Designers Develop CareTech’s front-end user experience for caregivers.Designers, the operations team, and a product manager described how they approached curating the caregiver experi-ence. The data scientists, data analysts, and data stewards dis-cussed the metrics used to measure caregiver performance,the data that staffing algorithms use, and how algorithms work in practice.(2) Caregivers: We use the term ‘caregivers’ to refer to the people employed by CareTech to provide care for pay.(3) Coordinators: The term ‘coordinators’ refers to people that pay for CareTech’s services and coordinate their delivery,usually on behalf of an older loved one. Recruiting interview participants through a partnership with Stay-Home and CareTech potentially biased results toward more positive perspectives of organizational practices. Caregivers and coordina-tors with more negative views about the company may have been reluctant to share their opinions or participate in interviews alto-gether due to fears of retaliation from the platform. Convenience Sampling limited the extent to which we were able to understand differences across demographic subgroups. Future work should explore this issue. Further, recruitment overlooked the perspectives of care coordinators and caregivers who have left the platform due to difficulties This study draws on data gathered from one week of observations performed in July 2022 and 30 interviews conducted between May2022 and August 2022. We conducted in-depth interviews to understand the cultural inputs that shape algorithm design and the implications for caregivers and coordinators. Interviews are well-suited for understanding social dimensions of how people interpret the world and take actions based on those interpretations [64]. Interviews with technology workers show how they make sense of their work and build systems [67], and interviews with caregivers and coordinators show that care practices diverge from organizational philosophy [53]. After several interviews, one researcher visitedStayHome’s global headquarters and a company-owned agency,located in a major Midwestern city in the U.S. The researcher toured the company’s offices and met with support staff. In addition, theresearcher engaged these actors in informal conversations to learn how StayHome and CareTech operate. To understand how the plat-form is presented to caregivers and what aspects of paid care work are emphasized, the researcher observed a caregiver training ses-sion on lifting and transferring techniques at one of StayHome’scompany-owned franchises and attended a virtual onboarding ses-sion with CareTech in the afternoon.We developed the interview guide with interest in valuation and evaluation practices as they occur on CareTech’s platform. Treating valuation as a moral outlook, we drew on practice-oriented approaches to understanding how different actors conceptualize and contribute value in labor contexts [36]. Examining the practices of the people that develop platforms and those who are subject to their architecture provides an opportunity to identify the underlying justifications and actions that shape and transform care work as it occurs on the ground. Interview questions thus sought to elicit interviewees' daily practices, what elements of their work they described as most important, the least favorite aspects of their work,and their ideological orientation towards the concept of ‘care.’After obtaining consent, we recorded the interviews, which lasted between 45 and 90 minutes and took place mainly over Zoom. However, we did interview several caregivers and one coordinator in person. Team members iteratively refined these themes through discussion and mapped them to the EoW framework. We used a third-party qualitative coding tool (NVivo) to complete the coding process. To make theoretical sense of the data, we returned to the literature and iterated between data and extant research. Our findings indicate that technologists drew on several economies of worth—which we refer to as moral frameworks—to navigate the seemingly irreconcilable demands of home care. They referenced multiple interpretations of the term ‘care’ to resolve contradictions.We illustrate this point by first focusing on how technologists described the problems that they claim to solve. Then, we analyze the nature of the solutions they presented, highlighting how technolo-gists imbued different aspects of algorithm design and function with moral meanings. This finding demonstrates the interpretive flexibil-ity of technological artifacts. Finally, we turn to the perspectives of caregivers and coordinators. Their accounts show how algorithmic staffing practices created new forms of uncertainty—the mirror of technologists' stated intentions.4.1 Navigating Contextual ComplexityTechnologists drew on multiple moral frameworks to navigate expectations and demands, appealing to various interpretations of care’ to reconcile the contradictory pressures they face. The technologists we interviewed framed CareTech as a platform developed to address traditional home care agencies’ logistical and opera-tional challenges. In this context, they appealed to an industrial moral framework, framing their work as introducing greater levels of efficiency and rationalization to the home care industry. How-ever, many of the technologists we interviewed also framed their work in terms of a civic moral framework, critiquing prior staffing practices as subjective, opaque, unfair, and harmful to the material well-being of caregivers. Although these two narratives may appear contradictory, technologists unified these demands by appealing to the societal need for more care. For example, improvements inefficiency were discussed in terms of increasing the affordability of care while improving working conditions was imagined as growing the size of the caregiving workforce. We argue that technologists navigate complexity when creating and developing care algorithms by strategically appealing to justifications corresponding to differ-ent moral frameworks, drawing on multiple interpretations of a single term to move between them. Throughout this section, we draw attention to how technologists position algorithmic staffing practices as one solution to the problems they described.4.1.1 Platform Description & Motivations. The rhetoric that tech-nologists and company executives used to describe their motivation for building the platform appealed to domestic and social goods. In press releases and on the company website, CareTech’s execu-tives described their frustrations in searching for care for their own parents. Similarly, technologists invoked ideas of familial respon-sibility, relaying stories about their difficulties in finding care for aging parents. Technologists also drew on more civic-oriented no-tions of good, framing their work with reference to positive social change. For example, Richard described, “being part of something that can have a positive impact on society.” The company’s mission statement, was described as ‘improving care in society6, highlight-ing the significance of a single moral concept in technologists discourse.In discussing the company’s strategy, the technologists we in-terviewed described CareTech as a “platform,” “communication company,” or “logistical engine,”, foregrounding CareTech’s use of digital technology to improve efficiency, and framed their work asa response to logistical challenges in the home care industry. Aiden described what he framed as the company’s main value proposition:I think the big sort of sell is, it is getting harder and harder to operate care. I think it is getting more expensive...the core value proposition is where we are trying to figure out how to build a platform around doing this, and helping agencies focus more on their relationships with their communities and customers.He elaborated that, by centralizing operations, CareTech offers partner agencies relief from work that is “consuming and grueling,whether it’s paperwork, management, documentation, staffing, lo-gistics, or being on call all the time.” By filling this role, CareTech‘frees up agencies to both source customers and maintain that rela-tionship and kind of connection’ (Aiden). Repeated references to the relationship between CareTech and the agencies with which it partners serve two purposes. First, they identify areas whereCareTech uses technology to increase efficiency in the home care industry. This problem formulation provides the background for how organizational solutions are framed. Second, they format a division of labor. In this account, partner agencies are positioned as responsible for managing relationships in local markets, while the platform oversees aspects of labor control and management.Here, technologists frame the platform’s work in industrial terms and partner agencies in domestic terms. 4.1.2 Staffing Practices as Solutions. As they justified their work,technologists also blended elements from multiple moral frame-works. Specifically, they simultaneously appealed to notions of market dominance and civic responsibility. This overlap materialized as Robert, a data scientist, stated that the company’s scale offered a ‘unified view across markets’ and provided access to a sufficient amount of data to use statistical techniques to ‘learn from the data to provide better home care’, serving as a “competitive dif-ferentiator in the market.” In addition, Floyd framed the company's size as affording more ‘careful’ staffing practice:From a systemic perspective, when you are bigger you have these systems in place, and you do not have to guilt somebody into working a shift. If you need a shift filled, you have a stable of hundreds of caregivers you can reach out to, it is just a matter of how much bonus you have to put on it.These rhetorical strategies demonstrate how technologists draw on multiple moral frameworks to present their work as solutions to different problems.Building on discussions of CareTech’s organizational strategy,technologists most concretely articulated their efforts toward ‘im-proving care in society’ through labor management. They started these discussions by problematizing caregiver job quality under legacy home care practices as associated with low wages, few ben-efits, rigid scheduling practices, and little recognition of caregivers efforts. Kennedy critiqued legacy staffing practices on the grounds of fairness and transparency:There’s a lot of favoritism that happens. There’s a lack of transparency. And so as you can imagine, the caregivers who work the most shifts, they’re able to earn the most amount of money. And that’s really helping to improve their lives and livelihoods. Other technologists framed algorithmic staffing as a solution to the legacy staffing practices that Kennedy identified as opaque and unfair. While Kennedy incorporated concerns about material well-being into her critiques, other technologists generally avoided discussing their efforts toward increasing caregiver job quality in terms of a market-based moral framework. This may have resulted from the market constraints of care, where the price for private pay home care is inaccessible for many families. Aria explainedthat raising wages for caregivers would make the price of care“unpayable” by many clients. 4.1.3 Professionalizing Care. Instead, technologists framed their efforts as attempts to improve caregivers’ status and provide them with a career. Aria noted that improving the collective status of caregivers was part of CareTech’s mission since its founding, em-phasizing challenging aspects of the job:I think that a really big piece of what CareTech is try-ing to do and has been trying to do since the beginning you know, elevate the profession of caregiving. Andtruly treat it a profession instead of just a job...because it's a difficult, emotionally intense, sometimes physi-cally intense thing to do.Floyd described further aspirations to elevate caregivers’ status through professionalization:I would say that [career] is a north star for us. I think everyone views that as an innovation that we can and should make, and the profession is worth it... we're working towards it, but we haven’t actually gotten there yet.These discussions highlight the links that technologists establish between different moral frameworks as they respond to a complex set of challenges. While they expressed concern about the value that care holds in society, increasing the pecuniary value of car was viewed as infeasible. Technologists responded to this problem by appealing to the status of the profession. However, technologists most defined solutions came in the form of staffing algorithms.4.2 Datafying CareWe unpack staffing practices at CareTech, which we argue are emblematic of technological solutionism.

Contrary to technologists’ aspirations touse algorithms to build a fairer, more transparent order, algorithmic staffing practices in fact created new conditions of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. First, we focus on evaluation practices.CareTech’s app for caregivers displays ratings across several met-rics related to operational aspects of care delivery (i.e., timeliness,consistency, application usage, and call-offs).

There used to be the quarterly report where they would actually go in and visit and come back and say,‘this has changed, or this looks like it’s changed’...when someone steps in four or five times a year those are the ones that can pick out some things.Opal, who uses CareTech to provide care to her husband, discussed her attitude towards the surveys: “Honestly, I ignore [the surveys]. It’s not something I want to do. I don’t know why. I know they're doing great.” These perspectives demonstrate a difference in the worth actors ascribed to particular evaluation practices, high-lighting a mismatch between technologists’, coordinators’, and care-givers’ perspectives. Other coordinators described non-use of CareTech’s evaluation infrastructure, even when there were striking departures from care expectations. Coordinators justified their approach by appealing to different moral frameworks. Riley said, “what did happen onetime, and I should probably be more tuned into it...there was one day when one of the caregivers didn’t show up at all. And I didn't know about it until the next day.” She justified the non-use through appeals to a domestic moral framework: “I’m not as hands-on, I’mnot looking at the app to see what they’re doing. I get my feedback on how they’re doing from my mom and dad.” Winnie, who relied on a caregiver to transport her mother to church on Sunday mornings, described situations where sometimes a caregiver assigned to the shift couldn’t drive or had no car. Even so, she did not fill out regular surveys, drawing on her experience as a business owner (industrial)to express that she understood the challenges of staffing shifts: “it’sa very hard thing to maneuver in the world that we’re walking in. We Own a small business. We employ 13 ladies, so I understand.” At the same time, she seemed to negatively moralize non-use: “I will be honest with you that a survey has come...I haven’t filled it out. So I Haven't done due diligence on my part. You know, so I’m going to own that part.” While some coordinators expressed frustration about consistency, communication, quality, and the efficacy of evaluation practices, they appealed to multiple moral frameworks to justify different uses of evaluation infrastructure.4.3.2 Work Practices and Professional Boundaries. Continued dis-cussion with caregivers provided insight into how the problems that technologists faced contributed to aspects of platform design.The need to fill open shifts and coordinate care work across multiple individuals—associated with an industrial moral framework—took precedence over other concerns. Francine’s account of interactions with CareTech provides an example of how the need to staff shifts devalued communication about performance: “they have never given me any feedback or evaluation, the only time they call is about the schedule, asking if you can work more.” We argue that technologists prioritization of needs associated with the industrial moral frame-work eroded the boundary between caregivers’ work and personal lives and changed care practices.For example, the platform uses a notification system to bring open shifts to caregivers’ attention. However, Pepper describe how the constant notification stream makes it difficult for her to differentiate between work and leisure time:I can tell they have a lot of shifts to fill in. Am I go-ing to be under pressure? They’ve asked me for five things, and you said no to all of them, it feels likeI should say yes to something now. It’s just a little harder to be either working or not working...when you see your phone in the morning and you see all those notifications there.Hayden described receiving “30 to 40” notifications a day from the app, even after reaching out to CareTech to express that they would not work any more shifts. Further, they described confu-sion and frustration regarding the processes by which shifts were initially assigned:I actually said no to [the shift], but they scheduled me anyway. Which was how I got a lot of my shifts,which was okay...I know sometimes it sounds weird,but I would say no to a shift, maybe they’d think thatI said yes.This account suggests that the platform does not allow for as much flexibility as technologists imagine.In contrast to legacy record-keeping procedures, where care-givers left paper-based care notes in clients’ homes, CareTech’splatform requires that caregivers describe their shifts upon clock-ing out in an electronic journal that is viewable by coordinators and other caregivers. While caregivers described that the journal helped them feel more prepared for each shift, they also described reading journal entries outside of working hours, which provided further evidence for blurred boundaries between work and personal life.For example, Chauncey described reading entries “at night, before Igo to bed, I start reading if I’m going to work the next morning.” In Addition, platform architecture requiring caregivers to complete these logs changed caregivers’ relationship to time spent on the job. Francine described how filling out the notes, especially in the time-sensitive context of a shift, placed pressure on how she spent time providing care: “if you clock out right at a minute after [your shift ends] they get you on that.” Efforts to avoid disciplinary action created new relationships to time: “I just always try to clock out a few minutes before because you get all these questions before closing out the app” (Francine). In these cases, platform architecture changed caregivers' relationships with their time both on and off the clock,which put caregivers under additional pressure.We found that aspects of platform and algorithm design create new forms of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. We argue that this results from a mismatch between technologists’ moral reasoning and that of other platform actors. In addition, the need to fill open shifts and coordinate work across many individuals pri-oritizes a logic of efficiency over concerns for caregiver job quality.Despite coordinators’ unmet expectations and new pressures that the platform placed on caregivers, both sets of actors maintain a commitment to the platform. A possible explanation for contin-ued attachment is the moral significance of ‘care.’ While the term carries various meanings across actors and situations, it may act as a resource that maintains a particular status quo by mitigating organized critique of or departure from the platform.

41,MoralFrameworks,constrainsAgent,Technologists,"The subject of our case study, CareTech4, is one of several start-upsthat are credited with “reinventing the [home care] agency model”[22]. Prior to data collection, CareTech acquired StayHome, a traditional home care agency franchise. To contextualize our findings,we briefly discuss CareTech’s business model.CareTech partners with traditional home care agencies to support back-end administrative, legal, compliance, and logistics functions in exchange for a share of partner agencies’ revenue, employing caregivers directly. Caregivers assist with activities of daily living(i.e., bathing, dressing, getting in or out of a bed or chair, walking,using the toilet, eating) [43], and instrumental activities of daily living (i.e., cooking, cleaning, transportation, laundry, managing finances) [46]. CareTech’s use of algorithms to match caregivers to care recipients is central to our case. When we started data collection, CareTech’s technology platform had recently been im-plemented at StayHome’s company-owned agencies, providing a unique opportunity to investigate care algorithm implementation.In this paper, we focus primarily on CareTech’s staffing prac-tices. CareTech uses metrics and algorithms, along with human management, to staff shifts. Staffing algorithms have a role at two main sites: as initial schedules were made and when other care-givers called off their shifts. When caregivers are scheduled during their onboarding, staff members at CareTech use algorithmic recommendation systems to match caregivers with care recipients. Evaluation metrics (i.e., timeliness, consistency, application usage,and call-offs), along with other data (e.g., caregiver commute time,number of complaints) are used to match caregivers and care recipients. Coordinators receive weekly surveys about the quality of care provided, and provide responses on a linear scale5. After IRB approval, we recruited participants—technologists (n =14), caregivers (n = 9), and coordinators (n = 7)—through a partnership with CareTech and StayHome for interviews using convenience and purposive sampling [10]. StayHome’s research staff arranged site visit and helped recruit participants. We provided a brief description of the study and a screening questionnaire distributed amongst the caregivers and coordinators over email. This approach provided an opportunity to learn from technologists, caregivers,coordinators who were enthusiastic about sharing their experi-ences with the platform. Table 2 and table 3 provide an overview of participant profiles.(1) Technologists: Technologists consisted of software engi-neers, designers, product managers, and data and opera-tions workers. Software engineers talked about buildingCareTech’s features and the company’s history. Designers Develop CareTech’s front-end user experience for caregivers.Designers, the operations team, and a product manager described how they approached curating the caregiver experi-ence. The data scientists, data analysts, and data stewards dis-cussed the metrics used to measure caregiver performance,the data that staffing algorithms use, and how algorithms work in practice.(2) Caregivers: We use the term ‘caregivers’ to refer to the people employed by CareTech to provide care for pay.(3) Coordinators: The term ‘coordinators’ refers to people that pay for CareTech’s services and coordinate their delivery,usually on behalf of an older loved one. Recruiting interview participants through a partnership with Stay-Home and CareTech potentially biased results toward more positive perspectives of organizational practices. Caregivers and coordina-tors with more negative views about the company may have been reluctant to share their opinions or participate in interviews alto-gether due to fears of retaliation from the platform. Convenience Sampling limited the extent to which we were able to understand differences across demographic subgroups. Future work should explore this issue. Further, recruitment overlooked the perspectives of care coordinators and caregivers who have left the platform due to difficulties This study draws on data gathered from one week of observations performed in July 2022 and 30 interviews conducted between May2022 and August 2022. We conducted in-depth interviews to understand the cultural inputs that shape algorithm design and the implications for caregivers and coordinators. Interviews are well-suited for understanding social dimensions of how people interpret the world and take actions based on those interpretations [64]. Interviews with technology workers show how they make sense of their work and build systems [67], and interviews with caregivers and coordinators show that care practices diverge from organizational philosophy [53]. After several interviews, one researcher visitedStayHome’s global headquarters and a company-owned agency,located in a major Midwestern city in the U.S. The researcher toured the company’s offices and met with support staff. In addition, theresearcher engaged these actors in informal conversations to learn how StayHome and CareTech operate. To understand how the plat-form is presented to caregivers and what aspects of paid care work are emphasized, the researcher observed a caregiver training ses-sion on lifting and transferring techniques at one of StayHome’scompany-owned franchises and attended a virtual onboarding ses-sion with CareTech in the afternoon.We developed the interview guide with interest in valuation and evaluation practices as they occur on CareTech’s platform. Treating valuation as a moral outlook, we drew on practice-oriented approaches to understanding how different actors conceptualize and contribute value in labor contexts [36]. Examining the practices of the people that develop platforms and those who are subject to their architecture provides an opportunity to identify the underlying justifications and actions that shape and transform care work as it occurs on the ground. Interview questions thus sought to elicit interviewees' daily practices, what elements of their work they described as most important, the least favorite aspects of their work,and their ideological orientation towards the concept of ‘care.’After obtaining consent, we recorded the interviews, which lasted between 45 and 90 minutes and took place mainly over Zoom. However, we did interview several caregivers and one coordinator in person. Team members iteratively refined these themes through discussion and mapped them to the EoW framework. We used a third-party qualitative coding tool (NVivo) to complete the coding process. To make theoretical sense of the data, we returned to the literature and iterated between data and extant research. Our findings indicate that technologists drew on several economies of worth—which we refer to as moral frameworks—to navigate the seemingly irreconcilable demands of home care. They referenced multiple interpretations of the term ‘care’ to resolve contradictions.We illustrate this point by first focusing on how technologists described the problems that they claim to solve. Then, we analyze the nature of the solutions they presented, highlighting how technolo-gists imbued different aspects of algorithm design and function with moral meanings. This finding demonstrates the interpretive flexibil-ity of technological artifacts. Finally, we turn to the perspectives of caregivers and coordinators. Their accounts show how algorithmic staffing practices created new forms of uncertainty—the mirror of technologists' stated intentions.4.1 Navigating Contextual ComplexityTechnologists drew on multiple moral frameworks to navigate expectations and demands, appealing to various interpretations of care’ to reconcile the contradictory pressures they face. The technologists we interviewed framed CareTech as a platform developed to address traditional home care agencies’ logistical and opera-tional challenges. In this context, they appealed to an industrial moral framework, framing their work as introducing greater levels of efficiency and rationalization to the home care industry. How-ever, many of the technologists we interviewed also framed their work in terms of a civic moral framework, critiquing prior staffing practices as subjective, opaque, unfair, and harmful to the material well-being of caregivers. Although these two narratives may appear contradictory, technologists unified these demands by appealing to the societal need for more care. For example, improvements inefficiency were discussed in terms of increasing the affordability of care while improving working conditions was imagined as growing the size of the caregiving workforce. We argue that technologists navigate complexity when creating and developing care algorithms by strategically appealing to justifications corresponding to differ-ent moral frameworks, drawing on multiple interpretations of a single term to move between them. Throughout this section, we draw attention to how technologists position algorithmic staffing practices as one solution to the problems they described.4.1.1 Platform Description & Motivations. The rhetoric that tech-nologists and company executives used to describe their motivation for building the platform appealed to domestic and social goods. In press releases and on the company website, CareTech’s execu-tives described their frustrations in searching for care for their own parents. Similarly, technologists invoked ideas of familial respon-sibility, relaying stories about their difficulties in finding care for aging parents. Technologists also drew on more civic-oriented no-tions of good, framing their work with reference to positive social change. For example, Richard described, “being part of something that can have a positive impact on society.” The company’s mission statement, was described as ‘improving care in society6, highlight-ing the significance of a single moral concept in technologists discourse.In discussing the company’s strategy, the technologists we in-terviewed described CareTech as a “platform,” “communication company,” or “logistical engine,”, foregrounding CareTech’s use of digital technology to improve efficiency, and framed their work asa response to logistical challenges in the home care industry. Aiden described what he framed as the company’s main value proposition:I think the big sort of sell is, it is getting harder and harder to operate care. I think it is getting more expensive...the core value proposition is where we are trying to figure out how to build a platform around doing this, and helping agencies focus more on their relationships with their communities and customers.He elaborated that, by centralizing operations, CareTech offers partner agencies relief from work that is “consuming and grueling,whether it’s paperwork, management, documentation, staffing, lo-gistics, or being on call all the time.” By filling this role, CareTech‘frees up agencies to both source customers and maintain that rela-tionship and kind of connection’ (Aiden). Repeated references to the relationship between CareTech and the agencies with which it partners serve two purposes. First, they identify areas whereCareTech uses technology to increase efficiency in the home care industry. This problem formulation provides the background for how organizational solutions are framed. Second, they format a division of labor. In this account, partner agencies are positioned as responsible for managing relationships in local markets, while the platform oversees aspects of labor control and management.Here, technologists frame the platform’s work in industrial terms and partner agencies in domestic terms. 4.1.2 Staffing Practices as Solutions. As they justified their work,technologists also blended elements from multiple moral frame-works. Specifically, they simultaneously appealed to notions of market dominance and civic responsibility. This overlap materialized as Robert, a data scientist, stated that the company’s scale offered a ‘unified view across markets’ and provided access to a sufficient amount of data to use statistical techniques to ‘learn from the data to provide better home care’, serving as a “competitive dif-ferentiator in the market.” In addition, Floyd framed the company's size as affording more ‘careful’ staffing practice:From a systemic perspective, when you are bigger you have these systems in place, and you do not have to guilt somebody into working a shift. If you need a shift filled, you have a stable of hundreds of caregivers you can reach out to, it is just a matter of how much bonus you have to put on it.These rhetorical strategies demonstrate how technologists draw on multiple moral frameworks to present their work as solutions to different problems.Building on discussions of CareTech’s organizational strategy,technologists most concretely articulated their efforts toward ‘im-proving care in society’ through labor management. They started these discussions by problematizing caregiver job quality under legacy home care practices as associated with low wages, few ben-efits, rigid scheduling practices, and little recognition of caregivers efforts. Kennedy critiqued legacy staffing practices on the grounds of fairness and transparency:There’s a lot of favoritism that happens. There’s a lack of transparency. And so as you can imagine, the caregivers who work the most shifts, they’re able to earn the most amount of money. And that’s really helping to improve their lives and livelihoods. Other technologists framed algorithmic staffing as a solution to the legacy staffing practices that Kennedy identified as opaque and unfair. While Kennedy incorporated concerns about material well-being into her critiques, other technologists generally avoided discussing their efforts toward increasing caregiver job quality in terms of a market-based moral framework. This may have resulted from the market constraints of care, where the price for private pay home care is inaccessible for many families. Aria explainedthat raising wages for caregivers would make the price of care“unpayable” by many clients. 4.1.3 Professionalizing Care. Instead, technologists framed their efforts as attempts to improve caregivers’ status and provide them with a career. Aria noted that improving the collective status of caregivers was part of CareTech’s mission since its founding, em-phasizing challenging aspects of the job:I think that a really big piece of what CareTech is try-ing to do and has been trying to do since the beginning you know, elevate the profession of caregiving. Andtruly treat it a profession instead of just a job...because it's a difficult, emotionally intense, sometimes physi-cally intense thing to do.Floyd described further aspirations to elevate caregivers’ status through professionalization:I would say that [career] is a north star for us. I think everyone views that as an innovation that we can and should make, and the profession is worth it... we're working towards it, but we haven’t actually gotten there yet.These discussions highlight the links that technologists establish between different moral frameworks as they respond to a complex set of challenges. While they expressed concern about the value that care holds in society, increasing the pecuniary value of car was viewed as infeasible. Technologists responded to this problem by appealing to the status of the profession. However, technologists most defined solutions came in the form of staffing algorithms.4.2 Datafying CareWe unpack staffing practices at CareTech, which we argue are emblematic of technological solutionism. Our analysis reveals that technologists associated different aspects of staffing algorithms with different moral frameworks. We argue that how decisions are made about who is best suited for particular shifts—and why—is changing with the advent and implementation of algorithmic staffing tools as technologists prioritize efficiency. However, discussions with technologists show that there are tensions present in the use of algorithms. On the one hand, technologists discussed their work in terms of trying to increase caregiver performance. Performance Evaluation metrics break care into a set of constituent elements closely aligned with operational efficiency (an appeal to the indus-trial moral framework). On the other hand, technologists described their work as oriented toward establishing long-term relationships between caregivers and care recipients (an appeal to the domestic moral framework).The metrics and measurements that support algorithmic staffing practices are most closely associated with notions of productivity and operational efficiency. Technologists presented one part of their work as oriented toward increasing the “performance, or perceived performance of the caregiver” (Floyd). They described how this work is accomplished by measuring: (1) timeliness (how frequently a caregiver arrives to a shift on time); (2) consistency (adherence to schedule shifts); (3) application usage (whether or not the caregiver uses the application to clock in to and out of shifts and evaluate care recipient well-being); and (4) call-offs (shifts not released seven days in advance). While this evaluation practice makes care legible based on a discrete set of metrics, the composition of these metrics is oriented toward operational efficiency rather than the experiences of care recipients or care coordinators.Technologists contrasted their work with platforms in the ride-hailing industry7, describing how their work was motivated by the desire to establish long-term relationships between caregivers and care recipients. They referenced algorithms in terms that framed care as a holistic practice, often comparing the product of their work to other intimate relationships. Staffing algorithms have a role at two main sites: as initial schedules were made and when other caregivers called off their shifts. When caregivers are scheduled during their onboarding, staff members at CareTech use algorithmic recommendation systems to match caregivers with care recipients.In both cases, platform architects compared the matching process to other intimate relations between caregivers and care recipients.In Sandra’s words: Once the data are all collected, [the algorithm] gives us a list of caregivers, and it was ranked by most likely to be picked up by the caregiver...there is a...I don't want to say negotiating, but there are conversations that go back and forth. Because it does become an arranged marriage when you’re putting it inside thehome.In instances where shifts opened up with clients, the platform gives caregivers the option to pick up shifts with these clients through a user interface that Floyd described as “not not tinder 8 inspired. In advancing these relationship-based arguments, technologists define quality care by referencing domestic relationships between caregivers and care recipients.On the one hand, technologists seek to build a platform that effi-ciently delivers consistent care to a growing number of older adult care recipients. On the other, they describe their work as motivated by a desire to optimize relationships between caregivers and care recipients. At the same time, they framed their efforts as improving fairness, accountability, and transparency in staffing practices. Pair-ing discussions of metrics—which break care down into constituent elements associated with industrial efficiency—with algorithms staffing practices—which technologists use to frame evaluation in domestic terms—reveals that these actors associate different parts of their job with distinct moral frameworks to meet a complex set of demands. Further, interviews with caregivers and coordinators reveal that these performance evaluation criteria and platform staffing practices are a source of tension and stress.4.3 Platform AsymmetriesWhat are the consequences of technologists’ actions? To answer this question, we turn to platform caregivers’ and care coordinators’ per-spectives and experiences. Contrary to technologists’ aspirations touse algorithms to build a fairer, more transparent order, algorithmic staffing practices in fact created new conditions of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. First, we focus on evaluation practices.CareTech’s app for caregivers displays ratings across several met-rics related to operational aspects of care delivery (i.e., timeliness,consistency, application usage, and call-offs). The platform also sends weekly caregiver evaluation surveys to coordinators but does not share this feedback directly with caregivers. Further, caregivers rarely received qualitative feedback regarding the quality of care they provided. Caregivers discussed how these aspects of platform design contributed to ambiguity regarding insight into their perfor-mance, while coordinators approached completing survey-based caregiver evaluations with ambivalence. Second, we analyze care-givers’ interactions with CareTech’s staffing practices. Caregivers described experiencing collapsed boundaries between working and personal time. Despite these new challenges, the caregivers and coordinators we interviewed did not mention a desire to leave. .4.3.1 Ambiguity and Ambivalence. While caregivers described providing care as meaningful and were generally content with the conditions they faced on the platform, they discussed a lack of clarity regarding expectations and performance. As Hayden said:I believe that the clients, they also rate us after every shift. So then if we get rated lowly every time or pretty consistently, I’m sure they will reach out tous...I don’t know that it helps us rate our care and how well we’re doing with our clients, but I don't know how else they could do that...you hear stories of people who are dissatisfied with their care, and that's hard to tell.It was only after connecting with other caregivers that Hayden Learned that it was possible to request a performance evaluation form CareTech. Further, the opacity of metrics created feelings of worry for care-givers about their performance. As a new caregiver on the platform,Hazel worried about a low client consistency rating and discussed needing to take the initiative to understand why she received low ratings across other metrics. Puzzled about low application usage ratings, Hazel described needing to reach out to CareTech to understand “what [she] was missing.” CareTech’s communication and evaluation practices created unclear situations with multiple interpretations and required additional labor on the part of caregivers to understand how care recipients experienced their care and how the platform judged their performance. Coordinators, on the other hand, discussed their own evaluation practices as infused with ambivalence—a finding that we found surprising given the intimate and impactful context of care for an older loved one. While coordinators described clear feelings about the care provided to loved ones, our interviewees responded to CareTech’s evaluation surveys inconsistently. Coordinators expressed satisfaction with the care that caregivers provided and thus did not feel a need to fill out the company’s weekly care-giver evaluation survey, described how these surveys were not as useful compared to in-person evaluations performed over more extended periods, or expressed that they did not feel their feedback through these outlets was listened to by CareTech. Phyllis—who lives with her care recipient—described that since the quality of care was so consistent, there was not a need to be very detailed in her evaluations: “they will send out those [surveys] weekly...soyou click on attentiveness, preparation, and I don’t remember what they all are. There’s about five of them. I don’t get very detailed.” On The other hand, Brooks—who did not live with his care recipient,and was dissatisfied with the consistency of staffing provided byCareTech—described feeling overwhelmed by the amount of eval-uating he was asked to do: “For each one of the caregivers that has been in, they’re asking for an opinion for eight to 10 caregivers everyMonday, on the same thing, the same people doing the same thing.I’ve had a hard time seeing the value on a weekly basis.” He saw more value in evaluations carried out over longer intervals as it had been before the acquisition. There used to be the quarterly report where they would actually go in and visit and come back and say,‘this has changed, or this looks like it’s changed’...when someone steps in four or five times a year those are the ones that can pick out some things.Opal, who uses CareTech to provide care to her husband, discussed her attitude towards the surveys: “Honestly, I ignore [the surveys]. It’s not something I want to do. I don’t know why. I know they're doing great.” These perspectives demonstrate a difference in the worth actors ascribed to particular evaluation practices, high-lighting a mismatch between technologists’, coordinators’, and care-givers’ perspectives. Other coordinators described non-use of CareTech’s evaluation infrastructure, even when there were striking departures from care expectations. Coordinators justified their approach by appealing to different moral frameworks. Riley said, “what did happen onetime, and I should probably be more tuned into it...there was one day when one of the caregivers didn’t show up at all. And I didn't know about it until the next day.” She justified the non-use through appeals to a domestic moral framework: “I’m not as hands-on, I’mnot looking at the app to see what they’re doing. I get my feedback on how they’re doing from my mom and dad.” Winnie, who relied on a caregiver to transport her mother to church on Sunday mornings, described situations where sometimes a caregiver assigned to the shift couldn’t drive or had no car. Even so, she did not fill out regular surveys, drawing on her experience as a business owner (industrial)to express that she understood the challenges of staffing shifts: “it’sa very hard thing to maneuver in the world that we’re walking in. We Own a small business. We employ 13 ladies, so I understand.” At the same time, she seemed to negatively moralize non-use: “I will be honest with you that a survey has come...I haven’t filled it out. So I Haven't done due diligence on my part. You know, so I’m going to own that part.” While some coordinators expressed frustration about consistency, communication, quality, and the efficacy of evaluation practices, they appealed to multiple moral frameworks to justify different uses of evaluation infrastructure.4.3.2 Work Practices and Professional Boundaries. Continued dis-cussion with caregivers provided insight into how the problems that technologists faced contributed to aspects of platform design.The need to fill open shifts and coordinate care work across multiple individuals—associated with an industrial moral framework—took precedence over other concerns. Francine’s account of interactions with CareTech provides an example of how the need to staff shifts devalued communication about performance: “they have never given me any feedback or evaluation, the only time they call is about the schedule, asking if you can work more.” We argue that technologists prioritization of needs associated with the industrial moral frame-work eroded the boundary between caregivers’ work and personal lives and changed care practices.For example, the platform uses a notification system to bring open shifts to caregivers’ attention. However, Pepper describe how the constant notification stream makes it difficult for her to differentiate between work and leisure time:I can tell they have a lot of shifts to fill in. Am I go-ing to be under pressure? They’ve asked me for five things, and you said no to all of them, it feels likeI should say yes to something now. It’s just a little harder to be either working or not working...when you see your phone in the morning and you see all those notifications there.Hayden described receiving “30 to 40” notifications a day from the app, even after reaching out to CareTech to express that they would not work any more shifts. Further, they described confu-sion and frustration regarding the processes by which shifts were initially assigned:I actually said no to [the shift], but they scheduled me anyway. Which was how I got a lot of my shifts,which was okay...I know sometimes it sounds weird,but I would say no to a shift, maybe they’d think thatI said yes.This account suggests that the platform does not allow for as much flexibility as technologists imagine.In contrast to legacy record-keeping procedures, where care-givers left paper-based care notes in clients’ homes, CareTech’splatform requires that caregivers describe their shifts upon clock-ing out in an electronic journal that is viewable by coordinators and other caregivers. While caregivers described that the journal helped them feel more prepared for each shift, they also described reading journal entries outside of working hours, which provided further evidence for blurred boundaries between work and personal life.For example, Chauncey described reading entries “at night, before Igo to bed, I start reading if I’m going to work the next morning.” In Addition, platform architecture requiring caregivers to complete these logs changed caregivers’ relationship to time spent on the job.

In these cases, platform architecture changed caregivers' relationships with their time both on and off the clock,which put caregivers under additional pressure.We found that aspects of platform and algorithm design create new forms of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators.

We provided a brief description of the study and a screening questionnaire distributed amongst the caregivers and coordinators over email. This approach provided an opportunity to learn from technologists, caregivers,coordinators who were enthusiastic about sharing their experi-ences with the platform.

Recruiting interview participants through a partnership with Stay-Home and CareTech potentially biased results toward more positive perspectives of organizational practices. Caregivers and coordina-tors with more negative views about the company may have been reluctant to share their opinions or participate in interviews alto-gether due to fears of retaliation from the platform. Convenience Sampling limited the extent to which we were able to understand differences across demographic subgroups. Future work should explore this issue. Further, recruitment overlooked the perspectives of care coordinators and caregivers who have left the platform due to difficulties This study draws on data gathered from one week of observations performed in July 2022 and 30 interviews conducted between May2022 and August 2022. We conducted in-depth interviews to understand the cultural inputs that shape algorithm design and the implications for caregivers and coordinators. Interviews are well-suited for understanding social dimensions of how people interpret the world and take actions based on those interpretations [64]. Interviews with technology workers show how they make sense of their work and build systems [67], and interviews with caregivers and coordinators show that care practices diverge from organizational philosophy [53]. After several interviews, one researcher visitedStayHome’s global headquarters and a company-owned agency,located in a major Midwestern city in the U.S. The researcher toured the company’s offices and met with support staff. In addition, theresearcher engaged these actors in informal conversations to learn how StayHome and CareTech operate. To understand how the plat-form is presented to caregivers and what aspects of paid care work are emphasized, the researcher observed a caregiver training ses-sion on lifting and transferring techniques at one of StayHome’scompany-owned franchises and attended a virtual onboarding ses-sion with CareTech in the afternoon.We developed the interview guide with interest in valuation and evaluation practices as they occur on CareTech’s platform. Treating valuation as a moral outlook, we drew on practice-oriented approaches to understanding how different actors conceptualize and contribute value in labor contexts [36]. Examining the practices of the people that develop platforms and those who are subject to their architecture provides an opportunity to identify the underlying justifications and actions that shape and transform care work as it occurs on the ground. Interview questions thus sought to elicit interviewees' daily practices, what elements of their work they described as most important, the least favorite aspects of their work,and their ideological orientation towards the concept of ‘care.’After obtaining consent, we recorded the interviews, which lasted between 45 and 90 minutes and took place mainly over Zoom. However, we did interview several caregivers and one coordinator in person. Team members iteratively refined these themes through discussion and mapped them to the EoW framework. We used a third-party qualitative coding tool (NVivo) to complete the coding process. To make theoretical sense of the data, we returned to the literature and iterated between data and extant research. Our findings indicate that technologists drew on several economies of worth—which we refer to as moral frameworks—to navigate the seemingly irreconcilable demands of home care. They referenced multiple interpretations of the term ‘care’ to resolve contradictions.We illustrate this point by first focusing on how technologists described the problems that they claim to solve. Then, we analyze the nature of the solutions they presented, highlighting how technolo-gists imbued different aspects of algorithm design and function with moral meanings. This finding demonstrates the interpretive flexibil-ity of technological artifacts. Finally, we turn to the perspectives of caregivers and coordinators. Their accounts show how algorithmic staffing practices created new forms of uncertainty—the mirror of technologists' stated intentions.4.1 Navigating Contextual ComplexityTechnologists drew on multiple moral frameworks to navigate expectations and demands, appealing to various interpretations of care’ to reconcile the contradictory pressures they face. The technologists we interviewed framed CareTech as a platform developed to address traditional home care agencies’ logistical and opera-tional challenges. In this context, they appealed to an industrial moral framework, framing their work as introducing greater levels of efficiency and rationalization to the home care industry. How-ever, many of the technologists we interviewed also framed their work in terms of a civic moral framework, critiquing prior staffing practices as subjective, opaque, unfair, and harmful to the material well-being of caregivers. Although these two narratives may appear contradictory, technologists unified these demands by appealing to the societal need for more care. For example, improvements inefficiency were discussed in terms of increasing the affordability of care while improving working conditions was imagined as growing the size of the caregiving workforce. We argue that technologists navigate complexity when creating and developing care algorithms by strategically appealing to justifications corresponding to differ-ent moral frameworks, drawing on multiple interpretations of a single term to move between them. Throughout this section, we draw attention to how technologists position algorithmic staffing practices as one solution to the problems they described.4.1.1 Platform Description & Motivations. The rhetoric that tech-nologists and company executives used to describe their motivation for building the platform appealed to domestic and social goods. In press releases and on the company website, CareTech’s execu-tives described their frustrations in searching for care for their own parents. Similarly, technologists invoked ideas of familial respon-sibility, relaying stories about their difficulties in finding care for aging parents. Technologists also drew on more civic-oriented no-tions of good, framing their work with reference to positive social change. For example, Richard described, “being part of something that can have a positive impact on society.” The company’s mission statement, was described as ‘improving care in society6, highlight-ing the significance of a single moral concept in technologists discourse.In discussing the company’s strategy, the technologists we in-terviewed described CareTech as a “platform,” “communication company,” or “logistical engine,”, foregrounding CareTech’s use of digital technology to improve efficiency, and framed their work asa response to logistical challenges in the home care industry. Aiden described what he framed as the company’s main value proposition:I think the big sort of sell is, it is getting harder and harder to operate care. I think it is getting more expensive...the core value proposition is where we are trying to figure out how to build a platform around doing this, and helping agencies focus more on their relationships with their communities and customers.He elaborated that, by centralizing operations, CareTech offers partner agencies relief from work that is “consuming and grueling,whether it’s paperwork, management, documentation, staffing, lo-gistics, or being on call all the time.” By filling this role, CareTech‘frees up agencies to both source customers and maintain that rela-tionship and kind of connection’ (Aiden). Repeated references to the relationship between CareTech and the agencies with which it partners serve two purposes. First, they identify areas whereCareTech uses technology to increase efficiency in the home care industry. This problem formulation provides the background for how organizational solutions are framed. Second, they format a division of labor. In this account, partner agencies are positioned as responsible for managing relationships in local markets, while the platform oversees aspects of labor control and management.Here, technologists frame the platform’s work in industrial terms and partner agencies in domestic terms. 4.1.2 Staffing Practices as Solutions. As they justified their work,technologists also blended elements from multiple moral frame-works. Specifically, they simultaneously appealed to notions of market dominance and civic responsibility. This overlap materialized as Robert, a data scientist, stated that the company’s scale offered a ‘unified view across markets’ and provided access to a sufficient amount of data to use statistical techniques to ‘learn from the data to provide better home care’, serving as a “competitive dif-ferentiator in the market.” In addition, Floyd framed the company's size as affording more ‘careful’ staffing practice:From a systemic perspective, when you are bigger you have these systems in place, and you do not have to guilt somebody into working a shift. If you need a shift filled, you have a stable of hundreds of caregivers you can reach out to, it is just a matter of how much bonus you have to put on it.These rhetorical strategies demonstrate how technologists draw on multiple moral frameworks to present their work as solutions to different problems.Building on discussions of CareTech’s organizational strategy,technologists most concretely articulated their efforts toward ‘im-proving care in society’ through labor management. They started these discussions by problematizing caregiver job quality under legacy home care practices as associated with low wages, few ben-efits, rigid scheduling practices, and little recognition of caregivers efforts. Kennedy critiqued legacy staffing practices on the grounds of fairness and transparency:There’s a lot of favoritism that happens. There’s a lack of transparency. And so as you can imagine, the caregivers who work the most shifts, they’re able to earn the most amount of money. And that’s really helping to improve their lives and livelihoods. Other technologists framed algorithmic staffing as a solution to the legacy staffing practices that Kennedy identified as opaque and unfair. While Kennedy incorporated concerns about material well-being into her critiques, other technologists generally avoided discussing their efforts toward increasing caregiver job quality in terms of a market-based moral framework. This may have resulted from the market constraints of care, where the price for private pay home care is inaccessible for many families. Aria explainedthat raising wages for caregivers would make the price of care“unpayable” by many clients. 4.1.3 Professionalizing Care. Instead, technologists framed their efforts as attempts to improve caregivers’ status and provide them with a career. Aria noted that improving the collective status of caregivers was part of CareTech’s mission since its founding, em-phasizing challenging aspects of the job:I think that a really big piece of what CareTech is try-ing to do and has been trying to do since the beginning you know, elevate the profession of caregiving. Andtruly treat it a profession instead of just a job...because it's a difficult, emotionally intense, sometimes physi-cally intense thing to do.Floyd described further aspirations to elevate caregivers’ status through professionalization:I would say that [career] is a north star for us. I think everyone views that as an innovation that we can and should make, and the profession is worth it... we're working towards it, but we haven’t actually gotten there yet.These discussions highlight the links that technologists establish between different moral frameworks as they respond to a complex set of challenges. While they expressed concern about the value that care holds in society, increasing the pecuniary value of car was viewed as infeasible. Technologists responded to this problem by appealing to the status of the profession. However, technologists most defined solutions came in the form of staffing algorithms.4.2 Datafying CareWe unpack staffing practices at CareTech, which we argue are emblematic of technological solutionism. Our analysis reveals that technologists associated different aspects of staffing algorithms with different moral frameworks. We argue that how decisions are made about who is best suited for particular shifts—and why—is changing with the advent and implementation of algorithmic staffing tools as technologists prioritize efficiency. However, discussions with technologists show that there are tensions present in the use of algorithms. On the one hand, technologists discussed their work in terms of trying to increase caregiver performance. Performance Evaluation metrics break care into a set of constituent elements closely aligned with operational efficiency (an appeal to the indus-trial moral framework). On the other hand, technologists described their work as oriented toward establishing long-term relationships between caregivers and care recipients (an appeal to the domestic moral framework).The metrics and measurements that support algorithmic staffing practices are most closely associated with notions of productivity and operational efficiency. Technologists presented one part of their work as oriented toward increasing the “performance, or perceived performance of the caregiver” (Floyd). They described how this work is accomplished by measuring: (1) timeliness (how frequently a caregiver arrives to a shift on time); (2) consistency (adherence to schedule shifts); (3) application usage (whether or not the caregiver uses the application to clock in to and out of shifts and evaluate care recipient well-being); and (4) call-offs (shifts not released seven days in advance). While this evaluation practice makes care legible based on a discrete set of metrics, the composition of these metrics is oriented toward operational efficiency rather than the experiences of care recipients or care coordinators.Technologists contrasted their work with platforms in the ride-hailing industry7, describing how their work was motivated by the desire to establish long-term relationships between caregivers and care recipients. They referenced algorithms in terms that framed care as a holistic practice, often comparing the product of their work to other intimate relationships. Staffing algorithms have a role at two main sites: as initial schedules were made and when other caregivers called off their shifts. When caregivers are scheduled during their onboarding, staff members at CareTech use algorithmic recommendation systems to match caregivers with care recipients.In both cases, platform architects compared the matching process to other intimate relations between caregivers and care recipients.In Sandra’s words: Once the data are all collected, [the algorithm] gives us a list of caregivers, and it was ranked by most likely to be picked up by the caregiver...there is a...I don't want to say negotiating, but there are conversations that go back and forth. Because it does become an arranged marriage when you’re putting it inside thehome.In instances where shifts opened up with clients, the platform gives caregivers the option to pick up shifts with these clients through a user interface that Floyd described as “not not tinder 8 inspired. In advancing these relationship-based arguments, technologists define quality care by referencing domestic relationships between caregivers and care recipients.On the one hand, technologists seek to build a platform that effi-ciently delivers consistent care to a growing number of older adult care recipients. On the other, they describe their work as motivated by a desire to optimize relationships between caregivers and care recipients. At the same time, they framed their efforts as improving fairness, accountability, and transparency in staffing practices. Pair-ing discussions of metrics—which break care down into constituent elements associated with industrial efficiency—with algorithms staffing practices—which technologists use to frame evaluation in domestic terms—reveals that these actors associate different parts of their job with distinct moral frameworks to meet a complex set of demands. Further, interviews with caregivers and coordinators reveal that these performance evaluation criteria and platform staffing practices are a source of tension and stress.4.3 Platform AsymmetriesWhat are the consequences of technologists’ actions? To answer this question, we turn to platform caregivers’ and care coordinators’ per-spectives and experiences. Contrary to technologists’ aspirations touse algorithms to build a fairer, more transparent order, algorithmic staffing practices in fact created new conditions of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. First, we focus on evaluation practices.CareTech’s app for caregivers displays ratings across several met-rics related to operational aspects of care delivery (i.e., timeliness,consistency, application usage, and call-offs). The platform also sends weekly caregiver evaluation surveys to coordinators but does not share this feedback directly with caregivers. Further, caregivers rarely received qualitative feedback regarding the quality of care they provided. Caregivers discussed how these aspects of platform design contributed to ambiguity regarding insight into their perfor-mance, while coordinators approached completing survey-based caregiver evaluations with ambivalence. Second, we analyze care-givers’ interactions with CareTech’s staffing practices. Caregivers described experiencing collapsed boundaries between working and personal time. Despite these new challenges, the caregivers and coordinators we interviewed did not mention a desire to leave. .4.3.1 Ambiguity and Ambivalence. While caregivers described providing care as meaningful and were generally content with the conditions they faced on the platform, they discussed a lack of clarity regarding expectations and performance. As Hayden said:I believe that the clients, they also rate us after every shift. So then if we get rated lowly every time or pretty consistently, I’m sure they will reach out tous...I don’t know that it helps us rate our care and how well we’re doing with our clients, but I don't know how else they could do that...you hear stories of people who are dissatisfied with their care, and that's hard to tell.It was only after connecting with other caregivers that Hayden Learned that it was possible to request a performance evaluation form CareTech. Further, the opacity of metrics created feelings of worry for care-givers about their performance. As a new caregiver on the platform,Hazel worried about a low client consistency rating and discussed needing to take the initiative to understand why she received low ratings across other metrics. Puzzled about low application usage ratings, Hazel described needing to reach out to CareTech to understand “what [she] was missing.” CareTech’s communication and evaluation practices created unclear situations with multiple interpretations and required additional labor on the part of caregivers to understand how care recipients experienced their care and how the platform judged their performance. Coordinators, on the other hand, discussed their own evaluation practices as infused with ambivalence—a finding that we found surprising given the intimate and impactful context of care for an older loved one. While coordinators described clear feelings about the care provided to loved ones, our interviewees responded to CareTech’s evaluation surveys inconsistently. Coordinators expressed satisfaction with the care that caregivers provided and thus did not feel a need to fill out the company’s weekly care-giver evaluation survey, described how these surveys were not as useful compared to in-person evaluations performed over more extended periods, or expressed that they did not feel their feedback through these outlets was listened to by CareTech. Phyllis—who lives with her care recipient—described that since the quality of care was so consistent, there was not a need to be very detailed in her evaluations: “they will send out those [surveys] weekly...soyou click on attentiveness, preparation, and I don’t remember what they all are. There’s about five of them. I don’t get very detailed.” On The other hand, Brooks—who did not live with his care recipient,and was dissatisfied with the consistency of staffing provided byCareTech—described feeling overwhelmed by the amount of eval-uating he was asked to do: “For each one of the caregivers that has been in, they’re asking for an opinion for eight to 10 caregivers everyMonday, on the same thing, the same people doing the same thing.I’ve had a hard time seeing the value on a weekly basis.” He saw more value in evaluations carried out over longer intervals as it had been before the acquisition. There used to be the quarterly report where they would actually go in and visit and come back and say,‘this has changed, or this looks like it’s changed’...when someone steps in four or five times a year those are the ones that can pick out some things.Opal, who uses CareTech to provide care to her husband, discussed her attitude towards the surveys: “Honestly, I ignore [the surveys]. It’s not something I want to do. I don’t know why. I know they're doing great.” These perspectives demonstrate a difference in the worth actors ascribed to particular evaluation practices, high-lighting a mismatch between technologists’, coordinators’, and care-givers’ perspectives. Other coordinators described non-use of CareTech’s evaluation infrastructure, even when there were striking departures from care expectations. Coordinators justified their approach by appealing to different moral frameworks. Riley said, “what did happen onetime, and I should probably be more tuned into it...there was one day when one of the caregivers didn’t show up at all. And I didn't know about it until the next day.” She justified the non-use through appeals to a domestic moral framework: “I’m not as hands-on, I’mnot looking at the app to see what they’re doing. I get my feedback on how they’re doing from my mom and dad.” Winnie, who relied on a caregiver to transport her mother to church on Sunday mornings, described situations where sometimes a caregiver assigned to the shift couldn’t drive or had no car. Even so, she did not fill out regular surveys, drawing on her experience as a business owner (industrial)to express that she understood the challenges of staffing shifts: “it’sa very hard thing to maneuver in the world that we’re walking in. We Own a small business. We employ 13 ladies, so I understand.” At the same time, she seemed to negatively moralize non-use: “I will be honest with you that a survey has come...I haven’t filled it out. So I Haven't done due diligence on my part. You know, so I’m going to own that part.” While some coordinators expressed frustration about consistency, communication, quality, and the efficacy of evaluation practices, they appealed to multiple moral frameworks to justify different uses of evaluation infrastructure.4.3.2 Work Practices and Professional Boundaries. Continued dis-cussion with caregivers provided insight into how the problems that technologists faced contributed to aspects of platform design.The need to fill open shifts and coordinate care work across multiple individuals—associated with an industrial moral framework—took precedence over other concerns. Francine’s account of interactions with CareTech provides an example of how the need to staff shifts devalued communication about performance: “they have never given me any feedback or evaluation, the only time they call is about the schedule, asking if you can work more.” We argue that technologists prioritization of needs associated with the industrial moral frame-work eroded the boundary between caregivers’ work and personal lives and changed care practices.For example, the platform uses a notification system to bring open shifts to caregivers’ attention. However, Pepper describe how the constant notification stream makes it difficult for her to differentiate between work and leisure time:I can tell they have a lot of shifts to fill in. Am I go-ing to be under pressure? They’ve asked me for five things, and you said no to all of them, it feels likeI should say yes to something now. It’s just a little harder to be either working or not working...when you see your phone in the morning and you see all those notifications there.Hayden described receiving “30 to 40” notifications a day from the app, even after reaching out to CareTech to express that they would not work any more shifts. Further, they described confu-sion and frustration regarding the processes by which shifts were initially assigned:I actually said no to [the shift], but they scheduled me anyway. Which was how I got a lot of my shifts,which was okay...I know sometimes it sounds weird,but I would say no to a shift, maybe they’d think thatI said yes.This account suggests that the platform does not allow for as much flexibility as technologists imagine.In contrast to legacy record-keeping procedures, where care-givers left paper-based care notes in clients’ homes, CareTech’splatform requires that caregivers describe their shifts upon clock-ing out in an electronic journal that is viewable by coordinators and other caregivers. While caregivers described that the journal helped them feel more prepared for each shift, they also described reading journal entries outside of working hours, which provided further evidence for blurred boundaries between work and personal life.For example, Chauncey described reading entries “at night, before Igo to bed, I start reading if I’m going to work the next morning.” In Addition, platform architecture requiring caregivers to complete these logs changed caregivers’ relationship to time spent on the job. Francine described how filling out the notes, especially in the time-sensitive context of a shift, placed pressure on how she spent time providing care: “if you clock out right at a minute after [your shift ends] they get you on that.” Efforts to avoid disciplinary action created new relationships to time: “I just always try to clock out a few minutes before because you get all these questions before closing out the app” (Francine). In these cases, platform architecture changed caregivers' relationships with their time both on and off the clock,which put caregivers under additional pressure.We found that aspects of platform and algorithm design create new forms of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. We argue that this results from a mismatch between technologists’ moral reasoning and that of other platform actors. In addition, the need to fill open shifts and coordinate work across many individuals pri-oritizes a logic of efficiency over concerns for caregiver job quality.Despite coordinators’ unmet expectations and new pressures that the platform placed on caregivers, both sets of actors maintain a commitment to the platform. A possible explanation for contin-ued attachment is the moral significance of ‘care.’ While the term carries various meanings across actors and situations, it may act as a resource that maintains a particular status quo by mitigating organized critique of or departure from the platform. ","629-30, 631-4",The rhetoric that technologists and company executives used to describe their motivation for building the platform appealed to domestic and social goods.
43,CivicGood,constrainsAgent,Technologists,"The subject of our case study, CareTech4, is one of several start-upsthat are credited with “reinventing the [home care] agency model”[22]. Prior to data collection, CareTech acquired StayHome, a traditional home care agency franchise. To contextualize our findings,we briefly discuss CareTech’s business model.CareTech partners with traditional home care agencies to support back-end administrative, legal, compliance, and logistics functions in exchange for a share of partner agencies’ revenue, employing caregivers directly. Caregivers assist with activities of daily living(i.e., bathing, dressing, getting in or out of a bed or chair, walking,using the toilet, eating) [43], and instrumental activities of daily living (i.e., cooking, cleaning, transportation, laundry, managing finances) [46]. CareTech’s use of algorithms to match caregivers to care recipients is central to our case. When we started data collection, CareTech’s technology platform had recently been im-plemented at StayHome’s company-owned agencies, providing a unique opportunity to investigate care algorithm implementation.In this paper, we focus primarily on CareTech’s staffing prac-tices. CareTech uses metrics and algorithms, along with human management, to staff shifts. Staffing algorithms have a role at two main sites: as initial schedules were made and when other care-givers called off their shifts. When caregivers are scheduled during their onboarding, staff members at CareTech use algorithmic recommendation systems to match caregivers with care recipients. Evaluation metrics (i.e., timeliness, consistency, application usage,and call-offs), along with other data (e.g., caregiver commute time,number of complaints) are used to match caregivers and care recipients. Coordinators receive weekly surveys about the quality of care provided, and provide responses on a linear scale5. After IRB approval, we recruited participants—technologists (n =14), caregivers (n = 9), and coordinators (n = 7)—through a partnership with CareTech and StayHome for interviews using convenience and purposive sampling [10]. StayHome’s research staff arranged site visit and helped recruit participants. We provided a brief description of the study and a screening questionnaire distributed amongst the caregivers and coordinators over email. This approach provided an opportunity to learn from technologists, caregivers,coordinators who were enthusiastic about sharing their experi-ences with the platform.

This overlap materialized as Robert, a data scientist, stated that the company’s scale offered a ‘unified view across markets’ and provided access to a sufficient amount of data to use statistical techniques to ‘learn from the data to provide better home care’, serving as a “competitive dif-ferentiator in the market.” In addition, Floyd framed the company's size as affording more ‘careful’ staffing practice:From a systemic perspective, when you are bigger you have these systems in place, and you do not have to guilt somebody into working a shift. If you need a shift filled, you have a stable of hundreds of caregivers you can reach out to, it is just a matter of how much bonus you have to put on it.These rhetorical strategies demonstrate how technologists draw on multiple moral frameworks to present their work as solutions to different problems.Building on discussions of CareTech’s organizational strategy,technologists most concretely articulated their efforts toward ‘im-proving care in society’ through labor management. They started these discussions by problematizing caregiver job quality under legacy home care practices as associated with low wages, few ben-efits, rigid scheduling practices, and little recognition of caregivers efforts. Kennedy critiqued legacy staffing practices on the grounds of fairness and transparency:There’s a lot of favoritism that happens. There’s a lack of transparency. And so as you can imagine, the caregivers who work the most shifts, they’re able to earn the most amount of money. And that’s really helping to improve their lives and livelihoods. Other technologists framed algorithmic staffing as a solution to the legacy staffing practices that Kennedy identified as opaque and unfair. While Kennedy incorporated concerns about material well-being into her critiques, other technologists generally avoided discussing their efforts toward increasing caregiver job quality in terms of a market-based moral framework. This may have resulted from the market constraints of care, where the price for private pay home care is inaccessible for many families. Aria explainedthat raising wages for caregivers would make the price of care“unpayable” by many clients. 4.1.3 Professionalizing Care. Instead, technologists framed their efforts as attempts to improve caregivers’ status and provide them with a career. Aria noted that improving the collective status of caregivers was part of CareTech’s mission since its founding, em-phasizing challenging aspects of the job:I think that a really big piece of what CareTech is try-ing to do and has been trying to do since the beginning you know, elevate the profession of caregiving. Andtruly treat it a profession instead of just a job...because it's a difficult, emotionally intense, sometimes physi-cally intense thing to do.Floyd described further aspirations to elevate caregivers’ status through professionalization:I would say that [career] is a north star for us. I think everyone views that as an innovation that we can and should make, and the profession is worth it... we're working towards it, but we haven’t actually gotten there yet.These discussions highlight the links that technologists establish between different moral frameworks as they respond to a complex set of challenges. While they expressed concern about the value that care holds in society, increasing the pecuniary value of car was viewed as infeasible. Technologists responded to this problem by appealing to the status of the profession. However, technologists most defined solutions came in the form of staffing algorithms.4.2 Datafying CareWe unpack staffing practices at CareTech, which we argue are emblematic of technological solutionism. Our analysis reveals that technologists associated different aspects of staffing algorithms with different moral frameworks. We argue that how decisions are made about who is best suited for particular shifts—and why—is changing with the advent and implementation of algorithmic staffing tools as technologists prioritize efficiency. However, discussions with technologists show that there are tensions present in the use of algorithms. On the one hand, technologists discussed their work in terms of trying to increase caregiver performance. Performance Evaluation metrics break care into a set of constituent elements closely aligned with operational efficiency (an appeal to the indus-trial moral framework). On the other hand, technologists described their work as oriented toward establishing long-term relationships between caregivers and care recipients (an appeal to the domestic moral framework).The metrics and measurements that support algorithmic staffing practices are most closely associated with notions of productivity and operational efficiency. Technologists presented one part of their work as oriented toward increasing the “performance, or perceived performance of the caregiver” (Floyd). They described how this work is accomplished by measuring: (1) timeliness (how frequently a caregiver arrives to a shift on time); (2) consistency (adherence to schedule shifts); (3) application usage (whether or not the caregiver uses the application to clock in to and out of shifts and evaluate care recipient well-being); and (4) call-offs (shifts not released seven days in advance). While this evaluation practice makes care legible based on a discrete set of metrics, the composition of these metrics is oriented toward operational efficiency rather than the experiences of care recipients or care coordinators.Technologists contrasted their work with platforms in the ride-hailing industry7, describing how their work was motivated by the desire to establish long-term relationships between caregivers and care recipients. They referenced algorithms in terms that framed care as a holistic practice, often comparing the product of their work to other intimate relationships. Staffing algorithms have a role at two main sites: as initial schedules were made and when other caregivers called off their shifts. When caregivers are scheduled during their onboarding, staff members at CareTech use algorithmic recommendation systems to match caregivers with care recipients.In both cases, platform architects compared the matching process to other intimate relations between caregivers and care recipients.In Sandra’s words: Once the data are all collected, [the algorithm] gives us a list of caregivers, and it was ranked by most likely to be picked up by the caregiver...there is a...I don't want to say negotiating, but there are conversations that go back and forth. Because it does become an arranged marriage when you’re putting it inside thehome.In instances where shifts opened up with clients, the platform gives caregivers the option to pick up shifts with these clients through a user interface that Floyd described as “not not tinder 8 inspired. In advancing these relationship-based arguments, technologists define quality care by referencing domestic relationships between caregivers and care recipients.On the one hand, technologists seek to build a platform that effi-ciently delivers consistent care to a growing number of older adult care recipients. On the other, they describe their work as motivated by a desire to optimize relationships between caregivers and care recipients. At the same time, they framed their efforts as improving fairness, accountability, and transparency in staffing practices. Pair-ing discussions of metrics—which break care down into constituent elements associated with industrial efficiency—with algorithms staffing practices—which technologists use to frame evaluation in domestic terms—reveals that these actors associate different parts of their job with distinct moral frameworks to meet a complex set of demands. Further, interviews with caregivers and coordinators reveal that these performance evaluation criteria and platform staffing practices are a source of tension and stress.4.3 Platform AsymmetriesWhat are the consequences of technologists’ actions? To answer this question, we turn to platform caregivers’ and care coordinators’ per-spectives and experiences. Contrary to technologists’ aspirations touse algorithms to build a fairer, more transparent order, algorithmic staffing practices in fact created new conditions of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. First, we focus on evaluation practices.CareTech’s app for caregivers displays ratings across several met-rics related to operational aspects of care delivery (i.e., timeliness,consistency, application usage, and call-offs). The platform also sends weekly caregiver evaluation surveys to coordinators but does not share this feedback directly with caregivers. Further, caregivers rarely received qualitative feedback regarding the quality of care they provided. Caregivers discussed how these aspects of platform design contributed to ambiguity regarding insight into their perfor-mance, while coordinators approached completing survey-based caregiver evaluations with ambivalence. Second, we analyze care-givers’ interactions with CareTech’s staffing practices. Caregivers described experiencing collapsed boundaries between working and personal time. Despite these new challenges, the caregivers and coordinators we interviewed did not mention a desire to leave. .4.3.1 Ambiguity and Ambivalence. While caregivers described providing care as meaningful and were generally content with the conditions they faced on the platform, they discussed a lack of clarity regarding expectations and performance. As Hayden said:I believe that the clients, they also rate us after every shift. So then if we get rated lowly every time or pretty consistently, I’m sure they will reach out tous...I don’t know that it helps us rate our care and how well we’re doing with our clients, but I don't know how else they could do that...you hear stories of people who are dissatisfied with their care, and that's hard to tell.It was only after connecting with other caregivers that Hayden Learned that it was possible to request a performance evaluation form CareTech. Further, the opacity of metrics created feelings of worry for care-givers about their performance. As a new caregiver on the platform,Hazel worried about a low client consistency rating and discussed needing to take the initiative to understand why she received low ratings across other metrics. Puzzled about low application usage ratings, Hazel described needing to reach out to CareTech to understand “what [she] was missing.” CareTech’s communication and evaluation practices created unclear situations with multiple interpretations and required additional labor on the part of caregivers to understand how care recipients experienced their care and how the platform judged their performance. Coordinators, on the other hand, discussed their own evaluation practices as infused with ambivalence—a finding that we found surprising given the intimate and impactful context of care for an older loved one. While coordinators described clear feelings about the care provided to loved ones, our interviewees responded to CareTech’s evaluation surveys inconsistently. Coordinators expressed satisfaction with the care that caregivers provided and thus did not feel a need to fill out the company’s weekly care-giver evaluation survey, described how these surveys were not as useful compared to in-person evaluations performed over more extended periods, or expressed that they did not feel their feedback through these outlets was listened to by CareTech. Phyllis—who lives with her care recipient—described that since the quality of care was so consistent, there was not a need to be very detailed in her evaluations: “they will send out those [surveys] weekly...soyou click on attentiveness, preparation, and I don’t remember what they all are. There’s about five of them. I don’t get very detailed.” On The other hand, Brooks—who did not live with his care recipient,and was dissatisfied with the consistency of staffing provided byCareTech—described feeling overwhelmed by the amount of eval-uating he was asked to do: “For each one of the caregivers that has been in, they’re asking for an opinion for eight to 10 caregivers everyMonday, on the same thing, the same people doing the same thing.I’ve had a hard time seeing the value on a weekly basis.” He saw more value in evaluations carried out over longer intervals as it had been before the acquisition. There used to be the quarterly report where they would actually go in and visit and come back and say,‘this has changed, or this looks like it’s changed’...when someone steps in four or five times a year those are the ones that can pick out some things.Opal, who uses CareTech to provide care to her husband, discussed her attitude towards the surveys: “Honestly, I ignore [the surveys]. It’s not something I want to do. I don’t know why. I know they're doing great.” These perspectives demonstrate a difference in the worth actors ascribed to particular evaluation practices, high-lighting a mismatch between technologists’, coordinators’, and care-givers’ perspectives. Other coordinators described non-use of CareTech’s evaluation infrastructure, even when there were striking departures from care expectations. Coordinators justified their approach by appealing to different moral frameworks. Riley said, “what did happen onetime, and I should probably be more tuned into it...there was one day when one of the caregivers didn’t show up at all. And I didn't know about it until the next day.” She justified the non-use through appeals to a domestic moral framework: “I’m not as hands-on, I’mnot looking at the app to see what they’re doing. I get my feedback on how they’re doing from my mom and dad.” Winnie, who relied on a caregiver to transport her mother to church on Sunday mornings, described situations where sometimes a caregiver assigned to the shift couldn’t drive or had no car. Even so, she did not fill out regular surveys, drawing on her experience as a business owner (industrial)to express that she understood the challenges of staffing shifts: “it’sa very hard thing to maneuver in the world that we’re walking in. We Own a small business. We employ 13 ladies, so I understand.” At the same time, she seemed to negatively moralize non-use: “I will be honest with you that a survey has come...I haven’t filled it out. So I Haven't done due diligence on my part. You know, so I’m going to own that part.” While some coordinators expressed frustration about consistency, communication, quality, and the efficacy of evaluation practices, they appealed to multiple moral frameworks to justify different uses of evaluation infrastructure.4.3.2 Work Practices and Professional Boundaries. Continued dis-cussion with caregivers provided insight into how the problems that technologists faced contributed to aspects of platform design.The need to fill open shifts and coordinate care work across multiple individuals—associated with an industrial moral framework—took precedence over other concerns. Francine’s account of interactions with CareTech provides an example of how the need to staff shifts devalued communication about performance: “they have never given me any feedback or evaluation, the only time they call is about the schedule, asking if you can work more.” We argue that technologists prioritization of needs associated with the industrial moral frame-work eroded the boundary between caregivers’ work and personal lives and changed care practices.For example, the platform uses a notification system to bring open shifts to caregivers’ attention. However, Pepper describe how the constant notification stream makes it difficult for her to differentiate between work and leisure time:I can tell they have a lot of shifts to fill in. Am I go-ing to be under pressure? They’ve asked me for five things, and you said no to all of them, it feels likeI should say yes to something now. It’s just a little harder to be either working or not working...when you see your phone in the morning and you see all those notifications there.Hayden described receiving “30 to 40” notifications a day from the app, even after reaching out to CareTech to express that they would not work any more shifts. Further, they described confu-sion and frustration regarding the processes by which shifts were initially assigned:I actually said no to [the shift], but they scheduled me anyway. Which was how I got a lot of my shifts,which was okay...I know sometimes it sounds weird,but I would say no to a shift, maybe they’d think thatI said yes.This account suggests that the platform does not allow for as much flexibility as technologists imagine.In contrast to legacy record-keeping procedures, where care-givers left paper-based care notes in clients’ homes, CareTech’splatform requires that caregivers describe their shifts upon clock-ing out in an electronic journal that is viewable by coordinators and other caregivers. While caregivers described that the journal helped them feel more prepared for each shift, they also described reading journal entries outside of working hours, which provided further evidence for blurred boundaries between work and personal life.For example, Chauncey described reading entries “at night, before Igo to bed, I start reading if I’m going to work the next morning.” In Addition, platform architecture requiring caregivers to complete these logs changed caregivers’ relationship to time spent on the job. Francine described how filling out the notes, especially in the time-sensitive context of a shift, placed pressure on how she spent time providing care: “if you clock out right at a minute after [your shift ends] they get you on that.” Efforts to avoid disciplinary action created new relationships to time: “I just always try to clock out a few minutes before because you get all these questions before closing out the app” (Francine). In these cases, platform architecture changed caregivers' relationships with their time both on and off the clock,which put caregivers under additional pressure.We found that aspects of platform and algorithm design create new forms of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. We argue that this results from a mismatch between technologists’ moral reasoning and that of other platform actors. In addition, the need to fill open shifts and coordinate work across many individuals pri-oritizes a logic of efficiency over concerns for caregiver job quality.Despite coordinators’ unmet expectations and new pressures that the platform placed on caregivers, both sets of actors maintain a commitment to the platform. A possible explanation for contin-ued attachment is the moral significance of ‘care.’ While the term carries various meanings across actors and situations, it may act as a resource that maintains a particular status quo by mitigating organized critique of or departure from the platform.

44,CareTech,hasProducedArtifact,Efficiency,"The subject of our case study, CareTech4, is one of several start-upsthat are credited with “reinventing the [home care] agency model”[22]. Prior to data collection, CareTech acquired StayHome, a traditional home care agency franchise. To contextualize our findings,we briefly discuss CareTech’s business model.CareTech partners with traditional home care agencies to support back-end administrative, legal, compliance, and logistics functions in exchange for a share of partner agencies’ revenue, employing caregivers directly. Caregivers assist with activities of daily living(i.e., bathing, dressing, getting in or out of a bed or chair, walking,using the toilet, eating) [43], and instrumental activities of daily living (i.e., cooking, cleaning, transportation, laundry, managing finances) [46]. CareTech’s use of algorithms to match caregivers to care recipients is central to our case. When we started data collection, CareTech’s technology platform had recently been im-plemented at StayHome’s company-owned agencies, providing a unique opportunity to investigate care algorithm implementation.In this paper, we focus primarily on CareTech’s staffing prac-tices. CareTech uses metrics and algorithms, along with human management, to staff shifts. Staffing algorithms have a role at two main sites: as initial schedules were made and when other care-givers called off their shifts. When caregivers are scheduled during their onboarding, staff members at CareTech use algorithmic recommendation systems to match caregivers with care recipients. Evaluation metrics (i.e., timeliness, consistency, application usage,and call-offs), along with other data (e.g., caregiver commute time,number of complaints) are used to match caregivers and care recipients. Coordinators receive weekly surveys about the quality of care provided, and provide responses on a linear scale5. After IRB approval, we recruited participants—technologists (n =14), caregivers (n = 9), and coordinators (n = 7)—through a partnership with CareTech and StayHome for interviews using convenience and purposive sampling [10]. StayHome’s research staff arranged site visit and helped recruit participants. We provided a brief description of the study and a screening questionnaire distributed amongst the caregivers and coordinators over email. This approach provided an opportunity to learn from technologists, caregivers,coordinators who were enthusiastic about sharing their experi-ences with the platform. Table 2 and table 3 provide an overview of participant profiles.(1) Technologists: Technologists consisted of software engi-neers, designers, product managers, and data and opera-tions workers. Software engineers talked about buildingCareTech’s features and the company’s history. Designers Develop CareTech’s front-end user experience for caregivers.Designers, the operations team, and a product manager described how they approached curating the caregiver experi-ence. The data scientists, data analysts, and data stewards dis-cussed the metrics used to measure caregiver performance,the data that staffing algorithms use, and how algorithms work in practice.(2) Caregivers: We use the term ‘caregivers’ to refer to the people employed by CareTech to provide care for pay.(3) Coordinators: The term ‘coordinators’ refers to people that pay for CareTech’s services and coordinate their delivery,usually on behalf of an older loved one. Recruiting interview participants through a partnership with Stay-Home and CareTech potentially biased results toward more positive perspectives of organizational practices. Caregivers and coordina-tors with more negative views about the company may have been reluctant to share their opinions or participate in interviews alto-gether due to fears of retaliation from the platform. Convenience Sampling limited the extent to which we were able to understand differences across demographic subgroups. Future work should explore this issue. Further, recruitment overlooked the perspectives of care coordinators and caregivers who have left the platform due to difficulties This study draws on data gathered from one week of observations performed in July 2022 and 30 interviews conducted between May2022 and August 2022. We conducted in-depth interviews to understand the cultural inputs that shape algorithm design and the implications for caregivers and coordinators. Interviews are well-suited for understanding social dimensions of how people interpret the world and take actions based on those interpretations [64]. Interviews with technology workers show how they make sense of their work and build systems [67], and interviews with caregivers and coordinators show that care practices diverge from organizational philosophy [53]. After several interviews, one researcher visitedStayHome’s global headquarters and a company-owned agency,located in a major Midwestern city in the U.S. The researcher toured the company’s offices and met with support staff. In addition, theresearcher engaged these actors in informal conversations to learn how StayHome and CareTech operate. To understand how the plat-form is presented to caregivers and what aspects of paid care work are emphasized, the researcher observed a caregiver training ses-sion on lifting and transferring techniques at one of StayHome’scompany-owned franchises and attended a virtual onboarding ses-sion with CareTech in the afternoon.We developed the interview guide with interest in valuation and evaluation practices as they occur on CareTech’s platform. Treating valuation as a moral outlook, we drew on practice-oriented approaches to understanding how different actors conceptualize and contribute value in labor contexts [36]. Examining the practices of the people that develop platforms and those who are subject to their architecture provides an opportunity to identify the underlying justifications and actions that shape and transform care work as it occurs on the ground. Interview questions thus sought to elicit interviewees' daily practices, what elements of their work they described as most important, the least favorite aspects of their work,and their ideological orientation towards the concept of ‘care.’After obtaining consent, we recorded the interviews, which lasted between 45 and 90 minutes and took place mainly over Zoom. However, we did interview several caregivers and one coordinator in person. Team members iteratively refined these themes through discussion and mapped them to the EoW framework. We used a third-party qualitative coding tool (NVivo) to complete the coding process. To make theoretical sense of the data, we returned to the literature and iterated between data and extant research. Our findings indicate that technologists drew on several economies of worth—which we refer to as moral frameworks—to navigate the seemingly irreconcilable demands of home care. They referenced multiple interpretations of the term ‘care’ to resolve contradictions.We illustrate this point by first focusing on how technologists described the problems that they claim to solve. Then, we analyze the nature of the solutions they presented, highlighting how technolo-gists imbued different aspects of algorithm design and function with moral meanings. This finding demonstrates the interpretive flexibil-ity of technological artifacts. Finally, we turn to the perspectives of caregivers and coordinators. Their accounts show how algorithmic staffing practices created new forms of uncertainty—the mirror of technologists' stated intentions.4.1 Navigating Contextual ComplexityTechnologists drew on multiple moral frameworks to navigate expectations and demands, appealing to various interpretations of care’ to reconcile the contradictory pressures they face. The technologists we interviewed framed CareTech as a platform developed to address traditional home care agencies’ logistical and opera-tional challenges. In this context, they appealed to an industrial moral framework, framing their work as introducing greater levels of efficiency and rationalization to the home care industry. How-ever, many of the technologists we interviewed also framed their work in terms of a civic moral framework, critiquing prior staffing practices as subjective, opaque, unfair, and harmful to the material well-being of caregivers. Although these two narratives may appear contradictory, technologists unified these demands by appealing to the societal need for more care. For example, improvements inefficiency were discussed in terms of increasing the affordability of care while improving working conditions was imagined as growing the size of the caregiving workforce. We argue that technologists navigate complexity when creating and developing care algorithms by strategically appealing to justifications corresponding to differ-ent moral frameworks, drawing on multiple interpretations of a single term to move between them. Throughout this section, we draw attention to how technologists position algorithmic staffing practices as one solution to the problems they described.4.1.1 Platform Description & Motivations. The rhetoric that tech-nologists and company executives used to describe their motivation for building the platform appealed to domestic and social goods. In press releases and on the company website, CareTech’s execu-tives described their frustrations in searching for care for their own parents. Similarly, technologists invoked ideas of familial respon-sibility, relaying stories about their difficulties in finding care for aging parents. Technologists also drew on more civic-oriented no-tions of good, framing their work with reference to positive social change. For example, Richard described, “being part of something that can have a positive impact on society.” The company’s mission statement, was described as ‘improving care in society6, highlight-ing the significance of a single moral concept in technologists discourse.In discussing the company’s strategy, the technologists we in-terviewed described CareTech as a “platform,” “communication company,” or “logistical engine,”, foregrounding CareTech’s use of digital technology to improve efficiency, and framed their work asa response to logistical challenges in the home care industry. Aiden described what he framed as the company’s main value proposition:I think the big sort of sell is, it is getting harder and harder to operate care. I think it is getting more expensive...the core value proposition is where we are trying to figure out how to build a platform around doing this, and helping agencies focus more on their relationships with their communities and customers.He elaborated that, by centralizing operations, CareTech offers partner agencies relief from work that is “consuming and grueling,whether it’s paperwork, management, documentation, staffing, lo-gistics, or being on call all the time.” By filling this role, CareTech‘frees up agencies to both source customers and maintain that rela-tionship and kind of connection’ (Aiden). Repeated references to the relationship between CareTech and the agencies with which it partners serve two purposes. First, they identify areas whereCareTech uses technology to increase efficiency in the home care industry. This problem formulation provides the background for how organizational solutions are framed. Second, they format a division of labor. In this account, partner agencies are positioned as responsible for managing relationships in local markets, while the platform oversees aspects of labor control and management.Here, technologists frame the platform’s work in industrial terms and partner agencies in domestic terms. 4.1.2 Staffing Practices as Solutions. As they justified their work,technologists also blended elements from multiple moral frame-works. Specifically, they simultaneously appealed to notions of market dominance and civic responsibility. This overlap materialized as Robert, a data scientist, stated that the company’s scale offered a ‘unified view across markets’ and provided access to a sufficient amount of data to use statistical techniques to ‘learn from the data to provide better home care’, serving as a “competitive dif-ferentiator in the market.” In addition, Floyd framed the company's size as affording more ‘careful’ staffing practice:From a systemic perspective, when you are bigger you have these systems in place, and you do not have to guilt somebody into working a shift. If you need a shift filled, you have a stable of hundreds of caregivers you can reach out to, it is just a matter of how much bonus you have to put on it.These rhetorical strategies demonstrate how technologists draw on multiple moral frameworks to present their work as solutions to different problems.Building on discussions of CareTech’s organizational strategy,technologists most concretely articulated their efforts toward ‘im-proving care in society’ through labor management. They started these discussions by problematizing caregiver job quality under legacy home care practices as associated with low wages, few ben-efits, rigid scheduling practices, and little recognition of caregivers efforts. Kennedy critiqued legacy staffing practices on the grounds of fairness and transparency:There’s a lot of favoritism that happens. There’s a lack of transparency. And so as you can imagine, the caregivers who work the most shifts, they’re able to earn the most amount of money. And that’s really helping to improve their lives and livelihoods. Other technologists framed algorithmic staffing as a solution to the legacy staffing practices that Kennedy identified as opaque and unfair. While Kennedy incorporated concerns about material well-being into her critiques, other technologists generally avoided discussing their efforts toward increasing caregiver job quality in terms of a market-based moral framework. This may have resulted from the market constraints of care, where the price for private pay home care is inaccessible for many families. Aria explainedthat raising wages for caregivers would make the price of care“unpayable” by many clients. 4.1.3 Professionalizing Care. Instead, technologists framed their efforts as attempts to improve caregivers’ status and provide them with a career. Aria noted that improving the collective status of caregivers was part of CareTech’s mission since its founding, em-phasizing challenging aspects of the job:I think that a really big piece of what CareTech is try-ing to do and has been trying to do since the beginning you know, elevate the profession of caregiving. Andtruly treat it a profession instead of just a job...because it's a difficult, emotionally intense, sometimes physi-cally intense thing to do.Floyd described further aspirations to elevate caregivers’ status through professionalization:I would say that [career] is a north star for us. I think everyone views that as an innovation that we can and should make, and the profession is worth it... we're working towards it, but we haven’t actually gotten there yet.These discussions highlight the links that technologists establish between different moral frameworks as they respond to a complex set of challenges. While they expressed concern about the value that care holds in society, increasing the pecuniary value of car was viewed as infeasible. Technologists responded to this problem by appealing to the status of the profession.

Contrary to technologists’ aspirations touse algorithms to build a fairer, more transparent order, algorithmic staffing practices in fact created new conditions of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators.

So then if we get rated lowly every time or pretty consistently, I’m sure they will reach out tous...I don’t know that it helps us rate our care and how well we’re doing with our clients, but I don't know how else they could do that...you hear stories of people who are dissatisfied with their care, and that's hard to tell.It was only after connecting with other caregivers that Hayden Learned that it was possible to request a performance evaluation form CareTech. Further, the opacity of metrics created feelings of worry for care-givers about their performance. As a new caregiver on the platform,Hazel worried about a low client consistency rating and discussed needing to take the initiative to understand why she received low ratings across other metrics. Puzzled about low application usage ratings, Hazel described needing to reach out to CareTech to understand “what [she] was missing.” CareTech’s communication and evaluation practices created unclear situations with multiple interpretations and required additional labor on the part of caregivers to understand how care recipients experienced their care and how the platform judged their performance. Coordinators, on the other hand, discussed their own evaluation practices as infused with ambivalence—a finding that we found surprising given the intimate and impactful context of care for an older loved one. While coordinators described clear feelings about the care provided to loved ones, our interviewees responded to CareTech’s evaluation surveys inconsistently. Coordinators expressed satisfaction with the care that caregivers provided and thus did not feel a need to fill out the company’s weekly care-giver evaluation survey, described how these surveys were not as useful compared to in-person evaluations performed over more extended periods, or expressed that they did not feel their feedback through these outlets was listened to by CareTech. Phyllis—who lives with her care recipient—described that since the quality of care was so consistent, there was not a need to be very detailed in her evaluations: “they will send out those [surveys] weekly...soyou click on attentiveness, preparation, and I don’t remember what they all are. There’s about five of them. I don’t get very detailed.” On The other hand, Brooks—who did not live with his care recipient,and was dissatisfied with the consistency of staffing provided byCareTech—described feeling overwhelmed by the amount of eval-uating he was asked to do: “For each one of the caregivers that has been in, they’re asking for an opinion for eight to 10 caregivers everyMonday, on the same thing, the same people doing the same thing.I’ve had a hard time seeing the value on a weekly basis.” He saw more value in evaluations carried out over longer intervals as it had been before the acquisition. There used to be the quarterly report where they would actually go in and visit and come back and say,‘this has changed, or this looks like it’s changed’...when someone steps in four or five times a year those are the ones that can pick out some things.Opal, who uses CareTech to provide care to her husband, discussed her attitude towards the surveys: “Honestly, I ignore [the surveys]. It’s not something I want to do. I don’t know why. I know they're doing great.” These perspectives demonstrate a difference in the worth actors ascribed to particular evaluation practices, high-lighting a mismatch between technologists’, coordinators’, and care-givers’ perspectives. Other coordinators described non-use of CareTech’s evaluation infrastructure, even when there were striking departures from care expectations. Coordinators justified their approach by appealing to different moral frameworks. Riley said, “what did happen onetime, and I should probably be more tuned into it...there was one day when one of the caregivers didn’t show up at all. And I didn't know about it until the next day.” She justified the non-use through appeals to a domestic moral framework: “I’m not as hands-on, I’mnot looking at the app to see what they’re doing. I get my feedback on how they’re doing from my mom and dad.” Winnie, who relied on a caregiver to transport her mother to church on Sunday mornings, described situations where sometimes a caregiver assigned to the shift couldn’t drive or had no car. Even so, she did not fill out regular surveys, drawing on her experience as a business owner (industrial)to express that she understood the challenges of staffing shifts: “it’sa very hard thing to maneuver in the world that we’re walking in. We Own a small business. We employ 13 ladies, so I understand.” At the same time, she seemed to negatively moralize non-use: “I will be honest with you that a survey has come...I haven’t filled it out. So I Haven't done due diligence on my part. You know, so I’m going to own that part.” While some coordinators expressed frustration about consistency, communication, quality, and the efficacy of evaluation practices, they appealed to multiple moral frameworks to justify different uses of evaluation infrastructure.4.3.2 Work Practices and Professional Boundaries. Continued dis-cussion with caregivers provided insight into how the problems that technologists faced contributed to aspects of platform design.The need to fill open shifts and coordinate care work across multiple individuals—associated with an industrial moral framework—took precedence over other concerns. Francine’s account of interactions with CareTech provides an example of how the need to staff shifts devalued communication about performance: “they have never given me any feedback or evaluation, the only time they call is about the schedule, asking if you can work more.” We argue that technologists prioritization of needs associated with the industrial moral frame-work eroded the boundary between caregivers’ work and personal lives and changed care practices.For example, the platform uses a notification system to bring open shifts to caregivers’ attention. However, Pepper describe how the constant notification stream makes it difficult for her to differentiate between work and leisure time:I can tell they have a lot of shifts to fill in. Am I go-ing to be under pressure? They’ve asked me for five things, and you said no to all of them, it feels likeI should say yes to something now. It’s just a little harder to be either working or not working...when you see your phone in the morning and you see all those notifications there.Hayden described receiving “30 to 40” notifications a day from the app, even after reaching out to CareTech to express that they would not work any more shifts. Further, they described confu-sion and frustration regarding the processes by which shifts were initially assigned:I actually said no to [the shift], but they scheduled me anyway. Which was how I got a lot of my shifts,which was okay...I know sometimes it sounds weird,but I would say no to a shift, maybe they’d think thatI said yes.This account suggests that the platform does not allow for as much flexibility as technologists imagine.In contrast to legacy record-keeping procedures, where care-givers left paper-based care notes in clients’ homes, CareTech’splatform requires that caregivers describe their shifts upon clock-ing out in an electronic journal that is viewable by coordinators and other caregivers. While caregivers described that the journal helped them feel more prepared for each shift, they also described reading journal entries outside of working hours, which provided further evidence for blurred boundaries between work and personal life.For example, Chauncey described reading entries “at night, before Igo to bed, I start reading if I’m going to work the next morning.” In Addition, platform architecture requiring caregivers to complete these logs changed caregivers’ relationship to time spent on the job. Francine described how filling out the notes, especially in the time-sensitive context of a shift, placed pressure on how she spent time providing care: “if you clock out right at a minute after [your shift ends] they get you on that.” Efforts to avoid disciplinary action created new relationships to time: “I just always try to clock out a few minutes before because you get all these questions before closing out the app” (Francine). In these cases, platform architecture changed caregivers' relationships with their time both on and off the clock,which put caregivers under additional pressure.We found that aspects of platform and algorithm design create new forms of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. We argue that this results from a mismatch between technologists’ moral reasoning and that of other platform actors. In addition, the need to fill open shifts and coordinate work across many individuals pri-oritizes a logic of efficiency over concerns for caregiver job quality.Despite coordinators’ unmet expectations and new pressures that the platform placed on caregivers, both sets of actors maintain a commitment to the platform. A possible explanation for contin-ued attachment is the moral significance of ‘care.’ While the term carries various meanings across actors and situations, it may act as a resource that maintains a particular status quo by mitigating organized critique of or departure from the platform.

45,MarketDominance,constrainsAgent,Technologists,"The subject of our case study, CareTech4, is one of several start-upsthat are credited with “reinventing the [home care] agency model”[22]. Prior to data collection, CareTech acquired StayHome, a traditional home care agency franchise. To contextualize our findings,we briefly discuss CareTech’s business model.CareTech partners with traditional home care agencies to support back-end administrative, legal, compliance, and logistics functions in exchange for a share of partner agencies’ revenue, employing caregivers directly. Caregivers assist with activities of daily living(i.e., bathing, dressing, getting in or out of a bed or chair, walking,using the toilet, eating) [43], and instrumental activities of daily living (i.e., cooking, cleaning, transportation, laundry, managing finances) [46]. CareTech’s use of algorithms to match caregivers to care recipients is central to our case. When we started data collection, CareTech’s technology platform had recently been im-plemented at StayHome’s company-owned agencies, providing a unique opportunity to investigate care algorithm implementation.In this paper, we focus primarily on CareTech’s staffing prac-tices. CareTech uses metrics and algorithms, along with human management, to staff shifts. Staffing algorithms have a role at two main sites: as initial schedules were made and when other care-givers called off their shifts. When caregivers are scheduled during their onboarding, staff members at CareTech use algorithmic recommendation systems to match caregivers with care recipients. Evaluation metrics (i.e., timeliness, consistency, application usage,and call-offs), along with other data (e.g., caregiver commute time,number of complaints) are used to match caregivers and care recipients. Coordinators receive weekly surveys about the quality of care provided, and provide responses on a linear scale5. After IRB approval, we recruited participants—technologists (n =14), caregivers (n = 9), and coordinators (n = 7)—through a partnership with CareTech and StayHome for interviews using convenience and purposive sampling [10]. StayHome’s research staff arranged site visit and helped recruit participants. We provided a brief description of the study and a screening questionnaire distributed amongst the caregivers and coordinators over email. This approach provided an opportunity to learn from technologists, caregivers,coordinators who were enthusiastic about sharing their experi-ences with the platform. Table 2 and table 3 provide an overview of participant profiles.(1) Technologists: Technologists consisted of software engi-neers, designers, product managers, and data and opera-tions workers. Software engineers talked about buildingCareTech’s features and the company’s history. Designers Develop CareTech’s front-end user experience for caregivers.Designers, the operations team, and a product manager described how they approached curating the caregiver experi-ence. The data scientists, data analysts, and data stewards dis-cussed the metrics used to measure caregiver performance,the data that staffing algorithms use, and how algorithms work in practice.(2) Caregivers: We use the term ‘caregivers’ to refer to the people employed by CareTech to provide care for pay.(3) Coordinators: The term ‘coordinators’ refers to people that pay for CareTech’s services and coordinate their delivery,usually on behalf of an older loved one. Recruiting interview participants through a partnership with Stay-Home and CareTech potentially biased results toward more positive perspectives of organizational practices. Caregivers and coordina-tors with more negative views about the company may have been reluctant to share their opinions or participate in interviews alto-gether due to fears of retaliation from the platform. Convenience Sampling limited the extent to which we were able to understand differences across demographic subgroups. Future work should explore this issue. Further, recruitment overlooked the perspectives of care coordinators and caregivers who have left the platform due to difficulties This study draws on data gathered from one week of observations performed in July 2022 and 30 interviews conducted between May2022 and August 2022. We conducted in-depth interviews to understand the cultural inputs that shape algorithm design and the implications for caregivers and coordinators. Interviews are well-suited for understanding social dimensions of how people interpret the world and take actions based on those interpretations [64]. Interviews with technology workers show how they make sense of their work and build systems [67], and interviews with caregivers and coordinators show that care practices diverge from organizational philosophy [53]. After several interviews, one researcher visitedStayHome’s global headquarters and a company-owned agency,located in a major Midwestern city in the U.S. The researcher toured the company’s offices and met with support staff. In addition, theresearcher engaged these actors in informal conversations to learn how StayHome and CareTech operate. To understand how the plat-form is presented to caregivers and what aspects of paid care work are emphasized, the researcher observed a caregiver training ses-sion on lifting and transferring techniques at one of StayHome’scompany-owned franchises and attended a virtual onboarding ses-sion with CareTech in the afternoon.We developed the interview guide with interest in valuation and evaluation practices as they occur on CareTech’s platform. Treating valuation as a moral outlook, we drew on practice-oriented approaches to understanding how different actors conceptualize and contribute value in labor contexts [36]. Examining the practices of the people that develop platforms and those who are subject to their architecture provides an opportunity to identify the underlying justifications and actions that shape and transform care work as it occurs on the ground. Interview questions thus sought to elicit interviewees' daily practices, what elements of their work they described as most important, the least favorite aspects of their work,and their ideological orientation towards the concept of ‘care.’After obtaining consent, we recorded the interviews, which lasted between 45 and 90 minutes and took place mainly over Zoom. However, we did interview several caregivers and one coordinator in person. Team members iteratively refined these themes through discussion and mapped them to the EoW framework. We used a third-party qualitative coding tool (NVivo) to complete the coding process. To make theoretical sense of the data, we returned to the literature and iterated between data and extant research. Our findings indicate that technologists drew on several economies of worth—which we refer to as moral frameworks—to navigate the seemingly irreconcilable demands of home care. They referenced multiple interpretations of the term ‘care’ to resolve contradictions.We illustrate this point by first focusing on how technologists described the problems that they claim to solve. Then, we analyze the nature of the solutions they presented, highlighting how technolo-gists imbued different aspects of algorithm design and function with moral meanings. This finding demonstrates the interpretive flexibil-ity of technological artifacts. Finally, we turn to the perspectives of caregivers and coordinators. Their accounts show how algorithmic staffing practices created new forms of uncertainty—the mirror of technologists' stated intentions.4.1 Navigating Contextual ComplexityTechnologists drew on multiple moral frameworks to navigate expectations and demands, appealing to various interpretations of care’ to reconcile the contradictory pressures they face. The technologists we interviewed framed CareTech as a platform developed to address traditional home care agencies’ logistical and opera-tional challenges. In this context, they appealed to an industrial moral framework, framing their work as introducing greater levels of efficiency and rationalization to the home care industry. How-ever, many of the technologists we interviewed also framed their work in terms of a civic moral framework, critiquing prior staffing practices as subjective, opaque, unfair, and harmful to the material well-being of caregivers. Although these two narratives may appear contradictory, technologists unified these demands by appealing to the societal need for more care. For example, improvements inefficiency were discussed in terms of increasing the affordability of care while improving working conditions was imagined as growing the size of the caregiving workforce. We argue that technologists navigate complexity when creating and developing care algorithms by strategically appealing to justifications corresponding to differ-ent moral frameworks, drawing on multiple interpretations of a single term to move between them. Throughout this section, we draw attention to how technologists position algorithmic staffing practices as one solution to the problems they described.4.1.1 Platform Description & Motivations. The rhetoric that tech-nologists and company executives used to describe their motivation for building the platform appealed to domestic and social goods. In press releases and on the company website, CareTech’s execu-tives described their frustrations in searching for care for their own parents. Similarly, technologists invoked ideas of familial respon-sibility, relaying stories about their difficulties in finding care for aging parents. Technologists also drew on more civic-oriented no-tions of good, framing their work with reference to positive social change. For example, Richard described, “being part of something that can have a positive impact on society.” The company’s mission statement, was described as ‘improving care in society6, highlight-ing the significance of a single moral concept in technologists discourse.In discussing the company’s strategy, the technologists we in-terviewed described CareTech as a “platform,” “communication company,” or “logistical engine,”, foregrounding CareTech’s use of digital technology to improve efficiency, and framed their work asa response to logistical challenges in the home care industry. Aiden described what he framed as the company’s main value proposition:I think the big sort of sell is, it is getting harder and harder to operate care. I think it is getting more expensive...the core value proposition is where we are trying to figure out how to build a platform around doing this, and helping agencies focus more on their relationships with their communities and customers.He elaborated that, by centralizing operations, CareTech offers partner agencies relief from work that is “consuming and grueling,whether it’s paperwork, management, documentation, staffing, lo-gistics, or being on call all the time.” By filling this role, CareTech‘frees up agencies to both source customers and maintain that rela-tionship and kind of connection’ (Aiden). Repeated references to the relationship between CareTech and the agencies with which it partners serve two purposes. First, they identify areas whereCareTech uses technology to increase efficiency in the home care industry. This problem formulation provides the background for how organizational solutions are framed. Second, they format a division of labor. In this account, partner agencies are positioned as responsible for managing relationships in local markets, while the platform oversees aspects of labor control and management.Here, technologists frame the platform’s work in industrial terms and partner agencies in domestic terms. 4.1.2 Staffing Practices as Solutions. As they justified their work,technologists also blended elements from multiple moral frame-works. Specifically, they simultaneously appealed to notions of market dominance and civic responsibility. This overlap materialized as Robert, a data scientist, stated that the company’s scale offered a ‘unified view across markets’ and provided access to a sufficient amount of data to use statistical techniques to ‘learn from the data to provide better home care’, serving as a “competitive dif-ferentiator in the market.” In addition, Floyd framed the company's size as affording more ‘careful’ staffing practice:From a systemic perspective, when you are bigger you have these systems in place, and you do not have to guilt somebody into working a shift. If you need a shift filled, you have a stable of hundreds of caregivers you can reach out to, it is just a matter of how much bonus you have to put on it.These rhetorical strategies demonstrate how technologists draw on multiple moral frameworks to present their work as solutions to different problems.Building on discussions of CareTech’s organizational strategy,technologists most concretely articulated their efforts toward ‘im-proving care in society’ through labor management. They started these discussions by problematizing caregiver job quality under legacy home care practices as associated with low wages, few ben-efits, rigid scheduling practices, and little recognition of caregivers efforts. Kennedy critiqued legacy staffing practices on the grounds of fairness and transparency:There’s a lot of favoritism that happens. There’s a lack of transparency. And so as you can imagine, the caregivers who work the most shifts, they’re able to earn the most amount of money. And that’s really helping to improve their lives and livelihoods. Other technologists framed algorithmic staffing as a solution to the legacy staffing practices that Kennedy identified as opaque and unfair. While Kennedy incorporated concerns about material well-being into her critiques, other technologists generally avoided discussing their efforts toward increasing caregiver job quality in terms of a market-based moral framework. This may have resulted from the market constraints of care, where the price for private pay home care is inaccessible for many families. Aria explainedthat raising wages for caregivers would make the price of care“unpayable” by many clients. 4.1.3 Professionalizing Care. Instead, technologists framed their efforts as attempts to improve caregivers’ status and provide them with a career. Aria noted that improving the collective status of caregivers was part of CareTech’s mission since its founding, em-phasizing challenging aspects of the job:I think that a really big piece of what CareTech is try-ing to do and has been trying to do since the beginning you know, elevate the profession of caregiving. Andtruly treat it a profession instead of just a job...because it's a difficult, emotionally intense, sometimes physi-cally intense thing to do.Floyd described further aspirations to elevate caregivers’ status through professionalization:I would say that [career] is a north star for us. I think everyone views that as an innovation that we can and should make, and the profession is worth it... we're working towards it, but we haven’t actually gotten there yet.These discussions highlight the links that technologists establish between different moral frameworks as they respond to a complex set of challenges. While they expressed concern about the value that care holds in society, increasing the pecuniary value of car was viewed as infeasible. Technologists responded to this problem by appealing to the status of the profession. However, technologists most defined solutions came in the form of staffing algorithms.4.2 Datafying CareWe unpack staffing practices at CareTech, which we argue are emblematic of technological solutionism. Our analysis reveals that technologists associated different aspects of staffing algorithms with different moral frameworks. We argue that how decisions are made about who is best suited for particular shifts—and why—is changing with the advent and implementation of algorithmic staffing tools as technologists prioritize efficiency. However, discussions with technologists show that there are tensions present in the use of algorithms. On the one hand, technologists discussed their work in terms of trying to increase caregiver performance. Performance Evaluation metrics break care into a set of constituent elements closely aligned with operational efficiency (an appeal to the indus-trial moral framework). On the other hand, technologists described their work as oriented toward establishing long-term relationships between caregivers and care recipients (an appeal to the domestic moral framework).The metrics and measurements that support algorithmic staffing practices are most closely associated with notions of productivity and operational efficiency. Technologists presented one part of their work as oriented toward increasing the “performance, or perceived performance of the caregiver” (Floyd). They described how this work is accomplished by measuring: (1) timeliness (how frequently a caregiver arrives to a shift on time); (2) consistency (adherence to schedule shifts); (3) application usage (whether or not the caregiver uses the application to clock in to and out of shifts and evaluate care recipient well-being); and (4) call-offs (shifts not released seven days in advance). While this evaluation practice makes care legible based on a discrete set of metrics, the composition of these metrics is oriented toward operational efficiency rather than the experiences of care recipients or care coordinators.Technologists contrasted their work with platforms in the ride-hailing industry7, describing how their work was motivated by the desire to establish long-term relationships between caregivers and care recipients. They referenced algorithms in terms that framed care as a holistic practice, often comparing the product of their work to other intimate relationships. Staffing algorithms have a role at two main sites: as initial schedules were made and when other caregivers called off their shifts. When caregivers are scheduled during their onboarding, staff members at CareTech use algorithmic recommendation systems to match caregivers with care recipients.In both cases, platform architects compared the matching process to other intimate relations between caregivers and care recipients.In Sandra’s words: Once the data are all collected, [the algorithm] gives us a list of caregivers, and it was ranked by most likely to be picked up by the caregiver...there is a...I don't want to say negotiating, but there are conversations that go back and forth. Because it does become an arranged marriage when you’re putting it inside thehome.In instances where shifts opened up with clients, the platform gives caregivers the option to pick up shifts with these clients through a user interface that Floyd described as “not not tinder 8 inspired. In advancing these relationship-based arguments, technologists define quality care by referencing domestic relationships between caregivers and care recipients.On the one hand, technologists seek to build a platform that effi-ciently delivers consistent care to a growing number of older adult care recipients. On the other, they describe their work as motivated by a desire to optimize relationships between caregivers and care recipients. At the same time, they framed their efforts as improving fairness, accountability, and transparency in staffing practices. Pair-ing discussions of metrics—which break care down into constituent elements associated with industrial efficiency—with algorithms staffing practices—which technologists use to frame evaluation in domestic terms—reveals that these actors associate different parts of their job with distinct moral frameworks to meet a complex set of demands. Further, interviews with caregivers and coordinators reveal that these performance evaluation criteria and platform staffing practices are a source of tension and stress.4.3 Platform AsymmetriesWhat are the consequences of technologists’ actions? To answer this question, we turn to platform caregivers’ and care coordinators’ per-spectives and experiences. Contrary to technologists’ aspirations touse algorithms to build a fairer, more transparent order, algorithmic staffing practices in fact created new conditions of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. First, we focus on evaluation practices.CareTech’s app for caregivers displays ratings across several met-rics related to operational aspects of care delivery (i.e., timeliness,consistency, application usage, and call-offs). The platform also sends weekly caregiver evaluation surveys to coordinators but does not share this feedback directly with caregivers. Further, caregivers rarely received qualitative feedback regarding the quality of care they provided. Caregivers discussed how these aspects of platform design contributed to ambiguity regarding insight into their perfor-mance, while coordinators approached completing survey-based caregiver evaluations with ambivalence. Second, we analyze care-givers’ interactions with CareTech’s staffing practices. Caregivers described experiencing collapsed boundaries between working and personal time. Despite these new challenges, the caregivers and coordinators we interviewed did not mention a desire to leave. .4.3.1 Ambiguity and Ambivalence. While caregivers described providing care as meaningful and were generally content with the conditions they faced on the platform, they discussed a lack of clarity regarding expectations and performance. As Hayden said:I believe that the clients, they also rate us after every shift. So then if we get rated lowly every time or pretty consistently, I’m sure they will reach out tous...I don’t know that it helps us rate our care and how well we’re doing with our clients, but I don't know how else they could do that...you hear stories of people who are dissatisfied with their care, and that's hard to tell.It was only after connecting with other caregivers that Hayden Learned that it was possible to request a performance evaluation form CareTech. Further, the opacity of metrics created feelings of worry for care-givers about their performance. As a new caregiver on the platform,Hazel worried about a low client consistency rating and discussed needing to take the initiative to understand why she received low ratings across other metrics. Puzzled about low application usage ratings, Hazel described needing to reach out to CareTech to understand “what [she] was missing.” CareTech’s communication and evaluation practices created unclear situations with multiple interpretations and required additional labor on the part of caregivers to understand how care recipients experienced their care and how the platform judged their performance. Coordinators, on the other hand, discussed their own evaluation practices as infused with ambivalence—a finding that we found surprising given the intimate and impactful context of care for an older loved one. While coordinators described clear feelings about the care provided to loved ones, our interviewees responded to CareTech’s evaluation surveys inconsistently. Coordinators expressed satisfaction with the care that caregivers provided and thus did not feel a need to fill out the company’s weekly care-giver evaluation survey, described how these surveys were not as useful compared to in-person evaluations performed over more extended periods, or expressed that they did not feel their feedback through these outlets was listened to by CareTech. Phyllis—who lives with her care recipient—described that since the quality of care was so consistent, there was not a need to be very detailed in her evaluations: “they will send out those [surveys] weekly...soyou click on attentiveness, preparation, and I don’t remember what they all are. There’s about five of them. I don’t get very detailed.” On The other hand, Brooks—who did not live with his care recipient,and was dissatisfied with the consistency of staffing provided byCareTech—described feeling overwhelmed by the amount of eval-uating he was asked to do: “For each one of the caregivers that has been in, they’re asking for an opinion for eight to 10 caregivers everyMonday, on the same thing, the same people doing the same thing.I’ve had a hard time seeing the value on a weekly basis.” He saw more value in evaluations carried out over longer intervals as it had been before the acquisition. There used to be the quarterly report where they would actually go in and visit and come back and say,‘this has changed, or this looks like it’s changed’...when someone steps in four or five times a year those are the ones that can pick out some things.Opal, who uses CareTech to provide care to her husband, discussed her attitude towards the surveys: “Honestly, I ignore [the surveys]. It’s not something I want to do. I don’t know why. I know they're doing great.” These perspectives demonstrate a difference in the worth actors ascribed to particular evaluation practices, high-lighting a mismatch between technologists’, coordinators’, and care-givers’ perspectives. Other coordinators described non-use of CareTech’s evaluation infrastructure, even when there were striking departures from care expectations. Coordinators justified their approach by appealing to different moral frameworks. Riley said, “what did happen onetime, and I should probably be more tuned into it...there was one day when one of the caregivers didn’t show up at all. And I didn't know about it until the next day.” She justified the non-use through appeals to a domestic moral framework: “I’m not as hands-on, I’mnot looking at the app to see what they’re doing. I get my feedback on how they’re doing from my mom and dad.” Winnie, who relied on a caregiver to transport her mother to church on Sunday mornings, described situations where sometimes a caregiver assigned to the shift couldn’t drive or had no car. Even so, she did not fill out regular surveys, drawing on her experience as a business owner (industrial)to express that she understood the challenges of staffing shifts: “it’sa very hard thing to maneuver in the world that we’re walking in. We Own a small business. We employ 13 ladies, so I understand.” At the same time, she seemed to negatively moralize non-use: “I will be honest with you that a survey has come...I haven’t filled it out. So I Haven't done due diligence on my part. You know, so I’m going to own that part.” While some coordinators expressed frustration about consistency, communication, quality, and the efficacy of evaluation practices, they appealed to multiple moral frameworks to justify different uses of evaluation infrastructure.4.3.2 Work Practices and Professional Boundaries. Continued dis-cussion with caregivers provided insight into how the problems that technologists faced contributed to aspects of platform design.The need to fill open shifts and coordinate care work across multiple individuals—associated with an industrial moral framework—took precedence over other concerns. Francine’s account of interactions with CareTech provides an example of how the need to staff shifts devalued communication about performance: “they have never given me any feedback or evaluation, the only time they call is about the schedule, asking if you can work more.” We argue that technologists prioritization of needs associated with the industrial moral frame-work eroded the boundary between caregivers’ work and personal lives and changed care practices.For example, the platform uses a notification system to bring open shifts to caregivers’ attention. However, Pepper describe how the constant notification stream makes it difficult for her to differentiate between work and leisure time:I can tell they have a lot of shifts to fill in. Am I go-ing to be under pressure? They’ve asked me for five things, and you said no to all of them, it feels likeI should say yes to something now. It’s just a little harder to be either working or not working...when you see your phone in the morning and you see all those notifications there.Hayden described receiving “30 to 40” notifications a day from the app, even after reaching out to CareTech to express that they would not work any more shifts. Further, they described confu-sion and frustration regarding the processes by which shifts were initially assigned:I actually said no to [the shift], but they scheduled me anyway. Which was how I got a lot of my shifts,which was okay...I know sometimes it sounds weird,but I would say no to a shift, maybe they’d think thatI said yes.This account suggests that the platform does not allow for as much flexibility as technologists imagine.In contrast to legacy record-keeping procedures, where care-givers left paper-based care notes in clients’ homes, CareTech’splatform requires that caregivers describe their shifts upon clock-ing out in an electronic journal that is viewable by coordinators and other caregivers. While caregivers described that the journal helped them feel more prepared for each shift, they also described reading journal entries outside of working hours, which provided further evidence for blurred boundaries between work and personal life.For example, Chauncey described reading entries “at night, before Igo to bed, I start reading if I’m going to work the next morning.” In Addition, platform architecture requiring caregivers to complete these logs changed caregivers’ relationship to time spent on the job. Francine described how filling out the notes, especially in the time-sensitive context of a shift, placed pressure on how she spent time providing care: “if you clock out right at a minute after [your shift ends] they get you on that.” Efforts to avoid disciplinary action created new relationships to time: “I just always try to clock out a few minutes before because you get all these questions before closing out the app” (Francine). In these cases, platform architecture changed caregivers' relationships with their time both on and off the clock,which put caregivers under additional pressure.We found that aspects of platform and algorithm design create new forms of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. We argue that this results from a mismatch between technologists’ moral reasoning and that of other platform actors.

46,Staffing,influencesPrecept,ProblemsWithLegacyMethods,"The subject of our case study, CareTech4, is one of several start-upsthat are credited with “reinventing the [home care] agency model”[22]. Prior to data collection, CareTech acquired StayHome, a traditional home care agency franchise. To contextualize our findings,we briefly discuss CareTech’s business model.CareTech partners with traditional home care agencies to support back-end administrative, legal, compliance, and logistics functions in exchange for a share of partner agencies’ revenue, employing caregivers directly. Caregivers assist with activities of daily living(i.e., bathing, dressing, getting in or out of a bed or chair, walking,using the toilet, eating) [43], and instrumental activities of daily living (i.e., cooking, cleaning, transportation, laundry, managing finances) [46]. CareTech’s use of algorithms to match caregivers to care recipients is central to our case. When we started data collection, CareTech’s technology platform had recently been im-plemented at StayHome’s company-owned agencies, providing a unique opportunity to investigate care algorithm implementation.In this paper, we focus primarily on CareTech’s staffing prac-tices. CareTech uses metrics and algorithms, along with human management, to staff shifts. Staffing algorithms have a role at two main sites: as initial schedules were made and when other care-givers called off their shifts. When caregivers are scheduled during their onboarding, staff members at CareTech use algorithmic recommendation systems to match caregivers with care recipients. Evaluation metrics (i.e., timeliness, consistency, application usage,and call-offs), along with other data (e.g., caregiver commute time,number of complaints) are used to match caregivers and care recipients. Coordinators receive weekly surveys about the quality of care provided, and provide responses on a linear scale5. After IRB approval, we recruited participants—technologists (n =14), caregivers (n = 9), and coordinators (n = 7)—through a partnership with CareTech and StayHome for interviews using convenience and purposive sampling [10]. StayHome’s research staff arranged site visit and helped recruit participants. We provided a brief description of the study and a screening questionnaire distributed amongst the caregivers and coordinators over email. This approach provided an opportunity to learn from technologists, caregivers,coordinators who were enthusiastic about sharing their experi-ences with the platform. Table 2 and table 3 provide an overview of participant profiles.(1) Technologists: Technologists consisted of software engi-neers, designers, product managers, and data and opera-tions workers.

Recruiting interview participants through a partnership with Stay-Home and CareTech potentially biased results toward more positive perspectives of organizational practices. Caregivers and coordina-tors with more negative views about the company may have been reluctant to share their opinions or participate in interviews alto-gether due to fears of retaliation from the platform. Convenience Sampling limited the extent to which we were able to understand differences across demographic subgroups. Future work should explore this issue. Further, recruitment overlooked the perspectives of care coordinators and caregivers who have left the platform due to difficulties This study draws on data gathered from one week of observations performed in July 2022 and 30 interviews conducted between May2022 and August 2022. We conducted in-depth interviews to understand the cultural inputs that shape algorithm design and the implications for caregivers and coordinators. Interviews are well-suited for understanding social dimensions of how people interpret the world and take actions based on those interpretations [64]. Interviews with technology workers show how they make sense of their work and build systems [67], and interviews with caregivers and coordinators show that care practices diverge from organizational philosophy [53]. After several interviews, one researcher visitedStayHome’s global headquarters and a company-owned agency,located in a major Midwestern city in the U.S. The researcher toured the company’s offices and met with support staff. In addition, theresearcher engaged these actors in informal conversations to learn how StayHome and CareTech operate. To understand how the plat-form is presented to caregivers and what aspects of paid care work are emphasized, the researcher observed a caregiver training ses-sion on lifting and transferring techniques at one of StayHome’scompany-owned franchises and attended a virtual onboarding ses-sion with CareTech in the afternoon.We developed the interview guide with interest in valuation and evaluation practices as they occur on CareTech’s platform. Treating valuation as a moral outlook, we drew on practice-oriented approaches to understanding how different actors conceptualize and contribute value in labor contexts [36]. Examining the practices of the people that develop platforms and those who are subject to their architecture provides an opportunity to identify the underlying justifications and actions that shape and transform care work as it occurs on the ground. Interview questions thus sought to elicit interviewees' daily practices, what elements of their work they described as most important, the least favorite aspects of their work,and their ideological orientation towards the concept of ‘care.’After obtaining consent, we recorded the interviews, which lasted between 45 and 90 minutes and took place mainly over Zoom. However, we did interview several caregivers and one coordinator in person. Team members iteratively refined these themes through discussion and mapped them to the EoW framework. We used a third-party qualitative coding tool (NVivo) to complete the coding process. To make theoretical sense of the data, we returned to the literature and iterated between data and extant research. Our findings indicate that technologists drew on several economies of worth—which we refer to as moral frameworks—to navigate the seemingly irreconcilable demands of home care. They referenced multiple interpretations of the term ‘care’ to resolve contradictions.We illustrate this point by first focusing on how technologists described the problems that they claim to solve. Then, we analyze the nature of the solutions they presented, highlighting how technolo-gists imbued different aspects of algorithm design and function with moral meanings. This finding demonstrates the interpretive flexibil-ity of technological artifacts. Finally, we turn to the perspectives of caregivers and coordinators. Their accounts show how algorithmic staffing practices created new forms of uncertainty—the mirror of technologists' stated intentions.4.1 Navigating Contextual ComplexityTechnologists drew on multiple moral frameworks to navigate expectations and demands, appealing to various interpretations of care’ to reconcile the contradictory pressures they face. The technologists we interviewed framed CareTech as a platform developed to address traditional home care agencies’ logistical and opera-tional challenges. In this context, they appealed to an industrial moral framework, framing their work as introducing greater levels of efficiency and rationalization to the home care industry. How-ever, many of the technologists we interviewed also framed their work in terms of a civic moral framework, critiquing prior staffing practices as subjective, opaque, unfair, and harmful to the material well-being of caregivers. Although these two narratives may appear contradictory, technologists unified these demands by appealing to the societal need for more care. For example, improvements inefficiency were discussed in terms of increasing the affordability of care while improving working conditions was imagined as growing the size of the caregiving workforce. We argue that technologists navigate complexity when creating and developing care algorithms by strategically appealing to justifications corresponding to differ-ent moral frameworks, drawing on multiple interpretations of a single term to move between them. Throughout this section, we draw attention to how technologists position algorithmic staffing practices as one solution to the problems they described.4.1.1 Platform Description & Motivations. The rhetoric that tech-nologists and company executives used to describe their motivation for building the platform appealed to domestic and social goods. In press releases and on the company website, CareTech’s execu-tives described their frustrations in searching for care for their own parents. Similarly, technologists invoked ideas of familial respon-sibility, relaying stories about their difficulties in finding care for aging parents. Technologists also drew on more civic-oriented no-tions of good, framing their work with reference to positive social change. For example, Richard described, “being part of something that can have a positive impact on society.” The company’s mission statement, was described as ‘improving care in society6, highlight-ing the significance of a single moral concept in technologists discourse.In discussing the company’s strategy, the technologists we in-terviewed described CareTech as a “platform,” “communication company,” or “logistical engine,”, foregrounding CareTech’s use of digital technology to improve efficiency, and framed their work asa response to logistical challenges in the home care industry. Aiden described what he framed as the company’s main value proposition:I think the big sort of sell is, it is getting harder and harder to operate care. I think it is getting more expensive...the core value proposition is where we are trying to figure out how to build a platform around doing this, and helping agencies focus more on their relationships with their communities and customers.He elaborated that, by centralizing operations, CareTech offers partner agencies relief from work that is “consuming and grueling,whether it’s paperwork, management, documentation, staffing, lo-gistics, or being on call all the time.” By filling this role, CareTech‘frees up agencies to both source customers and maintain that rela-tionship and kind of connection’ (Aiden). Repeated references to the relationship between CareTech and the agencies with which it partners serve two purposes. First, they identify areas whereCareTech uses technology to increase efficiency in the home care industry. This problem formulation provides the background for how organizational solutions are framed. Second, they format a division of labor. In this account, partner agencies are positioned as responsible for managing relationships in local markets, while the platform oversees aspects of labor control and management.Here, technologists frame the platform’s work in industrial terms and partner agencies in domestic terms. 4.1.2 Staffing Practices as Solutions. As they justified their work,technologists also blended elements from multiple moral frame-works. Specifically, they simultaneously appealed to notions of market dominance and civic responsibility. This overlap materialized as Robert, a data scientist, stated that the company’s scale offered a ‘unified view across markets’ and provided access to a sufficient amount of data to use statistical techniques to ‘learn from the data to provide better home care’, serving as a “competitive dif-ferentiator in the market.” In addition, Floyd framed the company's size as affording more ‘careful’ staffing practice:From a systemic perspective, when you are bigger you have these systems in place, and you do not have to guilt somebody into working a shift. If you need a shift filled, you have a stable of hundreds of caregivers you can reach out to, it is just a matter of how much bonus you have to put on it.These rhetorical strategies demonstrate how technologists draw on multiple moral frameworks to present their work as solutions to different problems.Building on discussions of CareTech’s organizational strategy,technologists most concretely articulated their efforts toward ‘im-proving care in society’ through labor management. They started these discussions by problematizing caregiver job quality under legacy home care practices as associated with low wages, few ben-efits, rigid scheduling practices, and little recognition of caregivers efforts. Kennedy critiqued legacy staffing practices on the grounds of fairness and transparency:There’s a lot of favoritism that happens. There’s a lack of transparency. And so as you can imagine, the caregivers who work the most shifts, they’re able to earn the most amount of money. And that’s really helping to improve their lives and livelihoods. Other technologists framed algorithmic staffing as a solution to the legacy staffing practices that Kennedy identified as opaque and unfair. While Kennedy incorporated concerns about material well-being into her critiques, other technologists generally avoided discussing their efforts toward increasing caregiver job quality in terms of a market-based moral framework. This may have resulted from the market constraints of care, where the price for private pay home care is inaccessible for many families. Aria explainedthat raising wages for caregivers would make the price of care“unpayable” by many clients. 4.1.3 Professionalizing Care. Instead, technologists framed their efforts as attempts to improve caregivers’ status and provide them with a career. Aria noted that improving the collective status of caregivers was part of CareTech’s mission since its founding, em-phasizing challenging aspects of the job:I think that a really big piece of what CareTech is try-ing to do and has been trying to do since the beginning you know, elevate the profession of caregiving. Andtruly treat it a profession instead of just a job...because it's a difficult, emotionally intense, sometimes physi-cally intense thing to do.Floyd described further aspirations to elevate caregivers’ status through professionalization:I would say that [career] is a north star for us. I think everyone views that as an innovation that we can and should make, and the profession is worth it... we're working towards it, but we haven’t actually gotten there yet.These discussions highlight the links that technologists establish between different moral frameworks as they respond to a complex set of challenges. While they expressed concern about the value that care holds in society, increasing the pecuniary value of car was viewed as infeasible. Technologists responded to this problem by appealing to the status of the profession. However, technologists most defined solutions came in the form of staffing algorithms.4.2 Datafying CareWe unpack staffing practices at CareTech, which we argue are emblematic of technological solutionism. Our analysis reveals that technologists associated different aspects of staffing algorithms with different moral frameworks. We argue that how decisions are made about who is best suited for particular shifts—and why—is changing with the advent and implementation of algorithmic staffing tools as technologists prioritize efficiency. However, discussions with technologists show that there are tensions present in the use of algorithms. On the one hand, technologists discussed their work in terms of trying to increase caregiver performance. Performance Evaluation metrics break care into a set of constituent elements closely aligned with operational efficiency (an appeal to the indus-trial moral framework). On the other hand, technologists described their work as oriented toward establishing long-term relationships between caregivers and care recipients (an appeal to the domestic moral framework).The metrics and measurements that support algorithmic staffing practices are most closely associated with notions of productivity and operational efficiency. Technologists presented one part of their work as oriented toward increasing the “performance, or perceived performance of the caregiver” (Floyd). They described how this work is accomplished by measuring: (1) timeliness (how frequently a caregiver arrives to a shift on time); (2) consistency (adherence to schedule shifts); (3) application usage (whether or not the caregiver uses the application to clock in to and out of shifts and evaluate care recipient well-being); and (4) call-offs (shifts not released seven days in advance). While this evaluation practice makes care legible based on a discrete set of metrics, the composition of these metrics is oriented toward operational efficiency rather than the experiences of care recipients or care coordinators.Technologists contrasted their work with platforms in the ride-hailing industry7, describing how their work was motivated by the desire to establish long-term relationships between caregivers and care recipients. They referenced algorithms in terms that framed care as a holistic practice, often comparing the product of their work to other intimate relationships. Staffing algorithms have a role at two main sites: as initial schedules were made and when other caregivers called off their shifts. When caregivers are scheduled during their onboarding, staff members at CareTech use algorithmic recommendation systems to match caregivers with care recipients.In both cases, platform architects compared the matching process to other intimate relations between caregivers and care recipients.In Sandra’s words: Once the data are all collected, [the algorithm] gives us a list of caregivers, and it was ranked by most likely to be picked up by the caregiver...there is a...I don't want to say negotiating, but there are conversations that go back and forth. Because it does become an arranged marriage when you’re putting it inside thehome.In instances where shifts opened up with clients, the platform gives caregivers the option to pick up shifts with these clients through a user interface that Floyd described as “not not tinder 8 inspired. In advancing these relationship-based arguments, technologists define quality care by referencing domestic relationships between caregivers and care recipients.On the one hand, technologists seek to build a platform that effi-ciently delivers consistent care to a growing number of older adult care recipients. On the other, they describe their work as motivated by a desire to optimize relationships between caregivers and care recipients. At the same time, they framed their efforts as improving fairness, accountability, and transparency in staffing practices. Pair-ing discussions of metrics—which break care down into constituent elements associated with industrial efficiency—with algorithms staffing practices—which technologists use to frame evaluation in domestic terms—reveals that these actors associate different parts of their job with distinct moral frameworks to meet a complex set of demands. Further, interviews with caregivers and coordinators reveal that these performance evaluation criteria and platform staffing practices are a source of tension and stress.4.3 Platform AsymmetriesWhat are the consequences of technologists’ actions? To answer this question, we turn to platform caregivers’ and care coordinators’ per-spectives and experiences. Contrary to technologists’ aspirations touse algorithms to build a fairer, more transparent order, algorithmic staffing practices in fact created new conditions of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. First, we focus on evaluation practices.CareTech’s app for caregivers displays ratings across several met-rics related to operational aspects of care delivery (i.e., timeliness,consistency, application usage, and call-offs). The platform also sends weekly caregiver evaluation surveys to coordinators but does not share this feedback directly with caregivers. Further, caregivers rarely received qualitative feedback regarding the quality of care they provided. Caregivers discussed how these aspects of platform design contributed to ambiguity regarding insight into their perfor-mance, while coordinators approached completing survey-based caregiver evaluations with ambivalence. Second, we analyze care-givers’ interactions with CareTech’s staffing practices. Caregivers described experiencing collapsed boundaries between working and personal time. Despite these new challenges, the caregivers and coordinators we interviewed did not mention a desire to leave. .4.3.1 Ambiguity and Ambivalence. While caregivers described providing care as meaningful and were generally content with the conditions they faced on the platform, they discussed a lack of clarity regarding expectations and performance. As Hayden said:I believe that the clients, they also rate us after every shift. So then if we get rated lowly every time or pretty consistently, I’m sure they will reach out tous...I don’t know that it helps us rate our care and how well we’re doing with our clients, but I don't know how else they could do that...you hear stories of people who are dissatisfied with their care, and that's hard to tell.It was only after connecting with other caregivers that Hayden Learned that it was possible to request a performance evaluation form CareTech. Further, the opacity of metrics created feelings of worry for care-givers about their performance. As a new caregiver on the platform,Hazel worried about a low client consistency rating and discussed needing to take the initiative to understand why she received low ratings across other metrics. Puzzled about low application usage ratings, Hazel described needing to reach out to CareTech to understand “what [she] was missing.” CareTech’s communication and evaluation practices created unclear situations with multiple interpretations and required additional labor on the part of caregivers to understand how care recipients experienced their care and how the platform judged their performance. Coordinators, on the other hand, discussed their own evaluation practices as infused with ambivalence—a finding that we found surprising given the intimate and impactful context of care for an older loved one. While coordinators described clear feelings about the care provided to loved ones, our interviewees responded to CareTech’s evaluation surveys inconsistently. Coordinators expressed satisfaction with the care that caregivers provided and thus did not feel a need to fill out the company’s weekly care-giver evaluation survey, described how these surveys were not as useful compared to in-person evaluations performed over more extended periods, or expressed that they did not feel their feedback through these outlets was listened to by CareTech. Phyllis—who lives with her care recipient—described that since the quality of care was so consistent, there was not a need to be very detailed in her evaluations: “they will send out those [surveys] weekly...soyou click on attentiveness, preparation, and I don’t remember what they all are. There’s about five of them. I don’t get very detailed.” On The other hand, Brooks—who did not live with his care recipient,and was dissatisfied with the consistency of staffing provided byCareTech—described feeling overwhelmed by the amount of eval-uating he was asked to do: “For each one of the caregivers that has been in, they’re asking for an opinion for eight to 10 caregivers everyMonday, on the same thing, the same people doing the same thing.I’ve had a hard time seeing the value on a weekly basis.” He saw more value in evaluations carried out over longer intervals as it had been before the acquisition. There used to be the quarterly report where they would actually go in and visit and come back and say,‘this has changed, or this looks like it’s changed’...when someone steps in four or five times a year those are the ones that can pick out some things.Opal, who uses CareTech to provide care to her husband, discussed her attitude towards the surveys: “Honestly, I ignore [the surveys]. It’s not something I want to do. I don’t know why. I know they're doing great.” These perspectives demonstrate a difference in the worth actors ascribed to particular evaluation practices, high-lighting a mismatch between technologists’, coordinators’, and care-givers’ perspectives. Other coordinators described non-use of CareTech’s evaluation infrastructure, even when there were striking departures from care expectations. Coordinators justified their approach by appealing to different moral frameworks. Riley said, “what did happen onetime, and I should probably be more tuned into it...there was one day when one of the caregivers didn’t show up at all. And I didn't know about it until the next day.” She justified the non-use through appeals to a domestic moral framework: “I’m not as hands-on, I’mnot looking at the app to see what they’re doing. I get my feedback on how they’re doing from my mom and dad.” Winnie, who relied on a caregiver to transport her mother to church on Sunday mornings, described situations where sometimes a caregiver assigned to the shift couldn’t drive or had no car. Even so, she did not fill out regular surveys, drawing on her experience as a business owner (industrial)to express that she understood the challenges of staffing shifts: “it’sa very hard thing to maneuver in the world that we’re walking in. We Own a small business. We employ 13 ladies, so I understand.” At the same time, she seemed to negatively moralize non-use: “I will be honest with you that a survey has come...I haven’t filled it out. So I Haven't done due diligence on my part. You know, so I’m going to own that part.” While some coordinators expressed frustration about consistency, communication, quality, and the efficacy of evaluation practices, they appealed to multiple moral frameworks to justify different uses of evaluation infrastructure.4.3.2 Work Practices and Professional Boundaries. Continued dis-cussion with caregivers provided insight into how the problems that technologists faced contributed to aspects of platform design.The need to fill open shifts and coordinate care work across multiple individuals—associated with an industrial moral framework—took precedence over other concerns. Francine’s account of interactions with CareTech provides an example of how the need to staff shifts devalued communication about performance: “they have never given me any feedback or evaluation, the only time they call is about the schedule, asking if you can work more.” We argue that technologists prioritization of needs associated with the industrial moral frame-work eroded the boundary between caregivers’ work and personal lives and changed care practices.For example, the platform uses a notification system to bring open shifts to caregivers’ attention. However, Pepper describe how the constant notification stream makes it difficult for her to differentiate between work and leisure time:I can tell they have a lot of shifts to fill in. Am I go-ing to be under pressure? They’ve asked me for five things, and you said no to all of them, it feels likeI should say yes to something now. It’s just a little harder to be either working or not working...when you see your phone in the morning and you see all those notifications there.Hayden described receiving “30 to 40” notifications a day from the app, even after reaching out to CareTech to express that they would not work any more shifts. Further, they described confu-sion and frustration regarding the processes by which shifts were initially assigned:I actually said no to [the shift], but they scheduled me anyway. Which was how I got a lot of my shifts,which was okay...I know sometimes it sounds weird,but I would say no to a shift, maybe they’d think thatI said yes.This account suggests that the platform does not allow for as much flexibility as technologists imagine.In contrast to legacy record-keeping procedures, where care-givers left paper-based care notes in clients’ homes, CareTech’splatform requires that caregivers describe their shifts upon clock-ing out in an electronic journal that is viewable by coordinators and other caregivers. While caregivers described that the journal helped them feel more prepared for each shift, they also described reading journal entries outside of working hours, which provided further evidence for blurred boundaries between work and personal life.For example, Chauncey described reading entries “at night, before Igo to bed, I start reading if I’m going to work the next morning.” In Addition, platform architecture requiring caregivers to complete these logs changed caregivers’ relationship to time spent on the job. Francine described how filling out the notes, especially in the time-sensitive context of a shift, placed pressure on how she spent time providing care: “if you clock out right at a minute after [your shift ends] they get you on that.” Efforts to avoid disciplinary action created new relationships to time: “I just always try to clock out a few minutes before because you get all these questions before closing out the app” (Francine). In these cases, platform architecture changed caregivers' relationships with their time both on and off the clock,which put caregivers under additional pressure.We found that aspects of platform and algorithm design create new forms of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. We argue that this results from a mismatch between technologists’ moral reasoning and that of other platform actors. In addition, the need to fill open shifts and coordinate work across many individuals pri-oritizes a logic of efficiency over concerns for caregiver job quality.Despite coordinators’ unmet expectations and new pressures that the platform placed on caregivers, both sets of actors maintain a commitment to the platform. A possible explanation for contin-ued attachment is the moral significance of ‘care.’ While the term carries various meanings across actors and situations, it may act as a resource that maintains a particular status quo by mitigating organized critique of or departure from the platform.

In press releases and on the company website, CareTech’s execu-tives described their frustrations in searching for care for their own parents. Similarly, technologists invoked ideas of familial respon-sibility, relaying stories about their difficulties in finding care for aging parents. Technologists also drew on more civic-oriented no-tions of good, framing their work with reference to positive social change. For example, Richard described, “being part of something that can have a positive impact on society.” The company’s mission statement, was described as ‘improving care in society6, highlight-ing the significance of a single moral concept in technologists discourse.In discussing the company’s strategy, the technologists we in-terviewed described CareTech as a “platform,” “communication company,” or “logistical engine,”, foregrounding CareTech’s use of digital technology to improve efficiency, and framed their work asa response to logistical challenges in the home care industry. Aiden described what he framed as the company’s main value proposition:I think the big sort of sell is, it is getting harder and harder to operate care. I think it is getting more expensive...the core value proposition is where we are trying to figure out how to build a platform around doing this, and helping agencies focus more on their relationships with their communities and customers.He elaborated that, by centralizing operations, CareTech offers partner agencies relief from work that is “consuming and grueling,whether it’s paperwork, management, documentation, staffing, lo-gistics, or being on call all the time.” By filling this role, CareTech‘frees up agencies to both source customers and maintain that rela-tionship and kind of connection’ (Aiden). Repeated references to the relationship between CareTech and the agencies with which it partners serve two purposes. First, they identify areas whereCareTech uses technology to increase efficiency in the home care industry. This problem formulation provides the background for how organizational solutions are framed. Second, they format a division of labor. In this account, partner agencies are positioned as responsible for managing relationships in local markets, while the platform oversees aspects of labor control and management.Here, technologists frame the platform’s work in industrial terms and partner agencies in domestic terms. 4.1.2 Staffing Practices as Solutions. As they justified their work,technologists also blended elements from multiple moral frame-works. Specifically, they simultaneously appealed to notions of market dominance and civic responsibility. This overlap materialized as Robert, a data scientist, stated that the company’s scale offered a ‘unified view across markets’ and provided access to a sufficient amount of data to use statistical techniques to ‘learn from the data to provide better home care’, serving as a “competitive dif-ferentiator in the market.” In addition, Floyd framed the company's size as affording more ‘careful’ staffing practice:From a systemic perspective, when you are bigger you have these systems in place, and you do not have to guilt somebody into working a shift. If you need a shift filled, you have a stable of hundreds of caregivers you can reach out to, it is just a matter of how much bonus you have to put on it.These rhetorical strategies demonstrate how technologists draw on multiple moral frameworks to present their work as solutions to different problems.Building on discussions of CareTech’s organizational strategy,technologists most concretely articulated their efforts toward ‘im-proving care in society’ through labor management. They started these discussions by problematizing caregiver job quality under legacy home care practices as associated with low wages, few ben-efits, rigid scheduling practices, and little recognition of caregivers efforts. Kennedy critiqued legacy staffing practices on the grounds of fairness and transparency:There’s a lot of favoritism that happens. There’s a lack of transparency. And so as you can imagine, the caregivers who work the most shifts, they’re able to earn the most amount of money. And that’s really helping to improve their lives and livelihoods. Other technologists framed algorithmic staffing as a solution to the legacy staffing practices that Kennedy identified as opaque and unfair. While Kennedy incorporated concerns about material well-being into her critiques, other technologists generally avoided discussing their efforts toward increasing caregiver job quality in terms of a market-based moral framework. This may have resulted from the market constraints of care, where the price for private pay home care is inaccessible for many families. Aria explainedthat raising wages for caregivers would make the price of care“unpayable” by many clients. 4.1.3 Professionalizing Care. Instead, technologists framed their efforts as attempts to improve caregivers’ status and provide them with a career. Aria noted that improving the collective status of caregivers was part of CareTech’s mission since its founding, em-phasizing challenging aspects of the job:I think that a really big piece of what CareTech is try-ing to do and has been trying to do since the beginning you know, elevate the profession of caregiving. Andtruly treat it a profession instead of just a job...because it's a difficult, emotionally intense, sometimes physi-cally intense thing to do.Floyd described further aspirations to elevate caregivers’ status through professionalization:I would say that [career] is a north star for us. I think everyone views that as an innovation that we can and should make, and the profession is worth it... we're working towards it, but we haven’t actually gotten there yet.These discussions highlight the links that technologists establish between different moral frameworks as they respond to a complex set of challenges. While they expressed concern about the value that care holds in society, increasing the pecuniary value of car was viewed as infeasible. Technologists responded to this problem by appealing to the status of the profession. However, technologists most defined solutions came in the form of staffing algorithms.4.2 Datafying CareWe unpack staffing practices at CareTech, which we argue are emblematic of technological solutionism. Our analysis reveals that technologists associated different aspects of staffing algorithms with different moral frameworks. We argue that how decisions are made about who is best suited for particular shifts—and why—is changing with the advent and implementation of algorithmic staffing tools as technologists prioritize efficiency. However, discussions with technologists show that there are tensions present in the use of algorithms. On the one hand, technologists discussed their work in terms of trying to increase caregiver performance. Performance Evaluation metrics break care into a set of constituent elements closely aligned with operational efficiency (an appeal to the indus-trial moral framework). On the other hand, technologists described their work as oriented toward establishing long-term relationships between caregivers and care recipients (an appeal to the domestic moral framework).The metrics and measurements that support algorithmic staffing practices are most closely associated with notions of productivity and operational efficiency. Technologists presented one part of their work as oriented toward increasing the “performance, or perceived performance of the caregiver” (Floyd). They described how this work is accomplished by measuring: (1) timeliness (how frequently a caregiver arrives to a shift on time); (2) consistency (adherence to schedule shifts); (3) application usage (whether or not the caregiver uses the application to clock in to and out of shifts and evaluate care recipient well-being); and (4) call-offs (shifts not released seven days in advance). While this evaluation practice makes care legible based on a discrete set of metrics, the composition of these metrics is oriented toward operational efficiency rather than the experiences of care recipients or care coordinators.Technologists contrasted their work with platforms in the ride-hailing industry7, describing how their work was motivated by the desire to establish long-term relationships between caregivers and care recipients. They referenced algorithms in terms that framed care as a holistic practice, often comparing the product of their work to other intimate relationships. Staffing algorithms have a role at two main sites: as initial schedules were made and when other caregivers called off their shifts. When caregivers are scheduled during their onboarding, staff members at CareTech use algorithmic recommendation systems to match caregivers with care recipients.In both cases, platform architects compared the matching process to other intimate relations between caregivers and care recipients.In Sandra’s words: Once the data are all collected, [the algorithm] gives us a list of caregivers, and it was ranked by most likely to be picked up by the caregiver...there is a...I don't want to say negotiating, but there are conversations that go back and forth. Because it does become an arranged marriage when you’re putting it inside thehome.In instances where shifts opened up with clients, the platform gives caregivers the option to pick up shifts with these clients through a user interface that Floyd described as “not not tinder 8 inspired. In advancing these relationship-based arguments, technologists define quality care by referencing domestic relationships between caregivers and care recipients.On the one hand, technologists seek to build a platform that effi-ciently delivers consistent care to a growing number of older adult care recipients. On the other, they describe their work as motivated by a desire to optimize relationships between caregivers and care recipients. At the same time, they framed their efforts as improving fairness, accountability, and transparency in staffing practices. Pair-ing discussions of metrics—which break care down into constituent elements associated with industrial efficiency—with algorithms staffing practices—which technologists use to frame evaluation in domestic terms—reveals that these actors associate different parts of their job with distinct moral frameworks to meet a complex set of demands. Further, interviews with caregivers and coordinators reveal that these performance evaluation criteria and platform staffing practices are a source of tension and stress.4.3 Platform AsymmetriesWhat are the consequences of technologists’ actions? To answer this question, we turn to platform caregivers’ and care coordinators’ per-spectives and experiences. Contrary to technologists’ aspirations touse algorithms to build a fairer, more transparent order, algorithmic staffing practices in fact created new conditions of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. First, we focus on evaluation practices.CareTech’s app for caregivers displays ratings across several met-rics related to operational aspects of care delivery (i.e., timeliness,consistency, application usage, and call-offs). The platform also sends weekly caregiver evaluation surveys to coordinators but does not share this feedback directly with caregivers. Further, caregivers rarely received qualitative feedback regarding the quality of care they provided. Caregivers discussed how these aspects of platform design contributed to ambiguity regarding insight into their perfor-mance, while coordinators approached completing survey-based caregiver evaluations with ambivalence. Second, we analyze care-givers’ interactions with CareTech’s staffing practices. Caregivers described experiencing collapsed boundaries between working and personal time. Despite these new challenges, the caregivers and coordinators we interviewed did not mention a desire to leave. .4.3.1 Ambiguity and Ambivalence. While caregivers described providing care as meaningful and were generally content with the conditions they faced on the platform, they discussed a lack of clarity regarding expectations and performance. As Hayden said:I believe that the clients, they also rate us after every shift. So then if we get rated lowly every time or pretty consistently, I’m sure they will reach out tous...I don’t know that it helps us rate our care and how well we’re doing with our clients, but I don't know how else they could do that...you hear stories of people who are dissatisfied with their care, and that's hard to tell.It was only after connecting with other caregivers that Hayden Learned that it was possible to request a performance evaluation form CareTech. Further, the opacity of metrics created feelings of worry for care-givers about their performance. As a new caregiver on the platform,Hazel worried about a low client consistency rating and discussed needing to take the initiative to understand why she received low ratings across other metrics. Puzzled about low application usage ratings, Hazel described needing to reach out to CareTech to understand “what [she] was missing.” CareTech’s communication and evaluation practices created unclear situations with multiple interpretations and required additional labor on the part of caregivers to understand how care recipients experienced their care and how the platform judged their performance. Coordinators, on the other hand, discussed their own evaluation practices as infused with ambivalence—a finding that we found surprising given the intimate and impactful context of care for an older loved one. While coordinators described clear feelings about the care provided to loved ones, our interviewees responded to CareTech’s evaluation surveys inconsistently. Coordinators expressed satisfaction with the care that caregivers provided and thus did not feel a need to fill out the company’s weekly care-giver evaluation survey, described how these surveys were not as useful compared to in-person evaluations performed over more extended periods, or expressed that they did not feel their feedback through these outlets was listened to by CareTech. Phyllis—who lives with her care recipient—described that since the quality of care was so consistent, there was not a need to be very detailed in her evaluations: “they will send out those [surveys] weekly...soyou click on attentiveness, preparation, and I don’t remember what they all are. There’s about five of them. I don’t get very detailed.” On The other hand, Brooks—who did not live with his care recipient,and was dissatisfied with the consistency of staffing provided byCareTech—described feeling overwhelmed by the amount of eval-uating he was asked to do: “For each one of the caregivers that has been in, they’re asking for an opinion for eight to 10 caregivers everyMonday, on the same thing, the same people doing the same thing.I’ve had a hard time seeing the value on a weekly basis.” He saw more value in evaluations carried out over longer intervals as it had been before the acquisition. There used to be the quarterly report where they would actually go in and visit and come back and say,‘this has changed, or this looks like it’s changed’...when someone steps in four or five times a year those are the ones that can pick out some things.Opal, who uses CareTech to provide care to her husband, discussed her attitude towards the surveys: “Honestly, I ignore [the surveys]. It’s not something I want to do. I don’t know why. I know they're doing great.” These perspectives demonstrate a difference in the worth actors ascribed to particular evaluation practices, high-lighting a mismatch between technologists’, coordinators’, and care-givers’ perspectives. Other coordinators described non-use of CareTech’s evaluation infrastructure, even when there were striking departures from care expectations. Coordinators justified their approach by appealing to different moral frameworks. Riley said, “what did happen onetime, and I should probably be more tuned into it...there was one day when one of the caregivers didn’t show up at all. And I didn't know about it until the next day.” She justified the non-use through appeals to a domestic moral framework: “I’m not as hands-on, I’mnot looking at the app to see what they’re doing. I get my feedback on how they’re doing from my mom and dad.” Winnie, who relied on a caregiver to transport her mother to church on Sunday mornings, described situations where sometimes a caregiver assigned to the shift couldn’t drive or had no car. Even so, she did not fill out regular surveys, drawing on her experience as a business owner (industrial)to express that she understood the challenges of staffing shifts: “it’sa very hard thing to maneuver in the world that we’re walking in. We Own a small business. We employ 13 ladies, so I understand.” At the same time, she seemed to negatively moralize non-use: “I will be honest with you that a survey has come...I haven’t filled it out. So I Haven't done due diligence on my part. You know, so I’m going to own that part.” While some coordinators expressed frustration about consistency, communication, quality, and the efficacy of evaluation practices, they appealed to multiple moral frameworks to justify different uses of evaluation infrastructure.4.3.2 Work Practices and Professional Boundaries. Continued dis-cussion with caregivers provided insight into how the problems that technologists faced contributed to aspects of platform design.The need to fill open shifts and coordinate care work across multiple individuals—associated with an industrial moral framework—took precedence over other concerns. Francine’s account of interactions with CareTech provides an example of how the need to staff shifts devalued communication about performance: “they have never given me any feedback or evaluation, the only time they call is about the schedule, asking if you can work more.” We argue that technologists prioritization of needs associated with the industrial moral frame-work eroded the boundary between caregivers’ work and personal lives and changed care practices.For example, the platform uses a notification system to bring open shifts to caregivers’ attention. However, Pepper describe how the constant notification stream makes it difficult for her to differentiate between work and leisure time:I can tell they have a lot of shifts to fill in. Am I go-ing to be under pressure? They’ve asked me for five things, and you said no to all of them, it feels likeI should say yes to something now. It’s just a little harder to be either working or not working...when you see your phone in the morning and you see all those notifications there.Hayden described receiving “30 to 40” notifications a day from the app, even after reaching out to CareTech to express that they would not work any more shifts. Further, they described confu-sion and frustration regarding the processes by which shifts were initially assigned:I actually said no to [the shift], but they scheduled me anyway. Which was how I got a lot of my shifts,which was okay...I know sometimes it sounds weird,but I would say no to a shift, maybe they’d think thatI said yes.This account suggests that the platform does not allow for as much flexibility as technologists imagine.In contrast to legacy record-keeping procedures, where care-givers left paper-based care notes in clients’ homes, CareTech’splatform requires that caregivers describe their shifts upon clock-ing out in an electronic journal that is viewable by coordinators and other caregivers. While caregivers described that the journal helped them feel more prepared for each shift, they also described reading journal entries outside of working hours, which provided further evidence for blurred boundaries between work and personal life.For example, Chauncey described reading entries “at night, before Igo to bed, I start reading if I’m going to work the next morning.” In Addition, platform architecture requiring caregivers to complete these logs changed caregivers’ relationship to time spent on the job. Francine described how filling out the notes, especially in the time-sensitive context of a shift, placed pressure on how she spent time providing care: “if you clock out right at a minute after [your shift ends] they get you on that.” Efforts to avoid disciplinary action created new relationships to time: “I just always try to clock out a few minutes before because you get all these questions before closing out the app” (Francine). In these cases, platform architecture changed caregivers' relationships with their time both on and off the clock,which put caregivers under additional pressure.We found that aspects of platform and algorithm design create new forms of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. We argue that this results from a mismatch between technologists’ moral reasoning and that of other platform actors. In addition, the need to fill open shifts and coordinate work across many individuals pri-oritizes a logic of efficiency over concerns for caregiver job quality.Despite coordinators’ unmet expectations and new pressures that the platform placed on caregivers, both sets of actors maintain a commitment to the platform. A possible explanation for contin-ued attachment is the moral significance of ‘care.’ While the term carries various meanings across actors and situations, it may act as a resource that maintains a particular status quo by mitigating organized critique of or departure from the platform.

48,ImproveCaregiverStatus,constrainsAgent,Technologists,"The subject of our case study, CareTech4, is one of several start-upsthat are credited with “reinventing the [home care] agency model”[22]. Prior to data collection, CareTech acquired StayHome, a traditional home care agency franchise. To contextualize our findings,we briefly discuss CareTech’s business model.CareTech partners with traditional home care agencies to support back-end administrative, legal, compliance, and logistics functions in exchange for a share of partner agencies’ revenue, employing caregivers directly. Caregivers assist with activities of daily living(i.e., bathing, dressing, getting in or out of a bed or chair, walking,using the toilet, eating) [43], and instrumental activities of daily living (i.e., cooking, cleaning, transportation, laundry, managing finances) [46]. CareTech’s use of algorithms to match caregivers to care recipients is central to our case. When we started data collection, CareTech’s technology platform had recently been im-plemented at StayHome’s company-owned agencies, providing a unique opportunity to investigate care algorithm implementation.In this paper, we focus primarily on CareTech’s staffing prac-tices. CareTech uses metrics and algorithms, along with human management, to staff shifts. Staffing algorithms have a role at two main sites: as initial schedules were made and when other care-givers called off their shifts. When caregivers are scheduled during their onboarding, staff members at CareTech use algorithmic recommendation systems to match caregivers with care recipients. Evaluation metrics (i.e., timeliness, consistency, application usage,and call-offs), along with other data (e.g., caregiver commute time,number of complaints) are used to match caregivers and care recipients. Coordinators receive weekly surveys about the quality of care provided, and provide responses on a linear scale5. After IRB approval, we recruited participants—technologists (n =14), caregivers (n = 9), and coordinators (n = 7)—through a partnership with CareTech and StayHome for interviews using convenience and purposive sampling [10]. StayHome’s research staff arranged site visit and helped recruit participants. We provided a brief description of the study and a screening questionnaire distributed amongst the caregivers and coordinators over email. This approach provided an opportunity to learn from technologists, caregivers,coordinators who were enthusiastic about sharing their experi-ences with the platform. Table 2 and table 3 provide an overview of participant profiles.(1) Technologists: Technologists consisted of software engi-neers, designers, product managers, and data and opera-tions workers. Software engineers talked about buildingCareTech’s features and the company’s history. Designers Develop CareTech’s front-end user experience for caregivers.Designers, the operations team, and a product manager described how they approached curating the caregiver experi-ence. The data scientists, data analysts, and data stewards dis-cussed the metrics used to measure caregiver performance,the data that staffing algorithms use, and how algorithms work in practice.(2) Caregivers: We use the term ‘caregivers’ to refer to the people employed by CareTech to provide care for pay.(3) Coordinators: The term ‘coordinators’ refers to people that pay for CareTech’s services and coordinate their delivery,usually on behalf of an older loved one. Recruiting interview participants through a partnership with Stay-Home and CareTech potentially biased results toward more positive perspectives of organizational practices. Caregivers and coordina-tors with more negative views about the company may have been reluctant to share their opinions or participate in interviews alto-gether due to fears of retaliation from the platform. Convenience Sampling limited the extent to which we were able to understand differences across demographic subgroups. Future work should explore this issue. Further, recruitment overlooked the perspectives of care coordinators and caregivers who have left the platform due to difficulties This study draws on data gathered from one week of observations performed in July 2022 and 30 interviews conducted between May2022 and August 2022. We conducted in-depth interviews to understand the cultural inputs that shape algorithm design and the implications for caregivers and coordinators. Interviews are well-suited for understanding social dimensions of how people interpret the world and take actions based on those interpretations [64]. Interviews with technology workers show how they make sense of their work and build systems [67], and interviews with caregivers and coordinators show that care practices diverge from organizational philosophy [53]. After several interviews, one researcher visitedStayHome’s global headquarters and a company-owned agency,located in a major Midwestern city in the U.S. The researcher toured the company’s offices and met with support staff. In addition, theresearcher engaged these actors in informal conversations to learn how StayHome and CareTech operate. To understand how the plat-form is presented to caregivers and what aspects of paid care work are emphasized, the researcher observed a caregiver training ses-sion on lifting and transferring techniques at one of StayHome’scompany-owned franchises and attended a virtual onboarding ses-sion with CareTech in the afternoon.We developed the interview guide with interest in valuation and evaluation practices as they occur on CareTech’s platform. Treating valuation as a moral outlook, we drew on practice-oriented approaches to understanding how different actors conceptualize and contribute value in labor contexts [36]. Examining the practices of the people that develop platforms and those who are subject to their architecture provides an opportunity to identify the underlying justifications and actions that shape and transform care work as it occurs on the ground. Interview questions thus sought to elicit interviewees' daily practices, what elements of their work they described as most important, the least favorite aspects of their work,and their ideological orientation towards the concept of ‘care.’After obtaining consent, we recorded the interviews, which lasted between 45 and 90 minutes and took place mainly over Zoom. However, we did interview several caregivers and one coordinator in person. Team members iteratively refined these themes through discussion and mapped them to the EoW framework. We used a third-party qualitative coding tool (NVivo) to complete the coding process. To make theoretical sense of the data, we returned to the literature and iterated between data and extant research. Our findings indicate that technologists drew on several economies of worth—which we refer to as moral frameworks—to navigate the seemingly irreconcilable demands of home care. They referenced multiple interpretations of the term ‘care’ to resolve contradictions.We illustrate this point by first focusing on how technologists described the problems that they claim to solve. Then, we analyze the nature of the solutions they presented, highlighting how technolo-gists imbued different aspects of algorithm design and function with moral meanings. This finding demonstrates the interpretive flexibil-ity of technological artifacts. Finally, we turn to the perspectives of caregivers and coordinators. Their accounts show how algorithmic staffing practices created new forms of uncertainty—the mirror of technologists' stated intentions.4.1 Navigating Contextual ComplexityTechnologists drew on multiple moral frameworks to navigate expectations and demands, appealing to various interpretations of care’ to reconcile the contradictory pressures they face. The technologists we interviewed framed CareTech as a platform developed to address traditional home care agencies’ logistical and opera-tional challenges. In this context, they appealed to an industrial moral framework, framing their work as introducing greater levels of efficiency and rationalization to the home care industry. How-ever, many of the technologists we interviewed also framed their work in terms of a civic moral framework, critiquing prior staffing practices as subjective, opaque, unfair, and harmful to the material well-being of caregivers. Although these two narratives may appear contradictory, technologists unified these demands by appealing to the societal need for more care. For example, improvements inefficiency were discussed in terms of increasing the affordability of care while improving working conditions was imagined as growing the size of the caregiving workforce. We argue that technologists navigate complexity when creating and developing care algorithms by strategically appealing to justifications corresponding to differ-ent moral frameworks, drawing on multiple interpretations of a single term to move between them. Throughout this section, we draw attention to how technologists position algorithmic staffing practices as one solution to the problems they described.4.1.1 Platform Description & Motivations. The rhetoric that tech-nologists and company executives used to describe their motivation for building the platform appealed to domestic and social goods.

Repeated references to the relationship between CareTech and the agencies with which it partners serve two purposes. First, they identify areas whereCareTech uses technology to increase efficiency in the home care industry. This problem formulation provides the background for how organizational solutions are framed. Second, they format a division of labor. In this account, partner agencies are positioned as responsible for managing relationships in local markets, while the platform oversees aspects of labor control and management.Here, technologists frame the platform’s work in industrial terms and partner agencies in domestic terms. 4.1.2 Staffing Practices as Solutions.

This overlap materialized as Robert, a data scientist, stated that the company’s scale offered a ‘unified view across markets’ and provided access to a sufficient amount of data to use statistical techniques to ‘learn from the data to provide better home care’, serving as a “competitive dif-ferentiator in the market.” In addition, Floyd framed the company's size as affording more ‘careful’ staffing practice:From a systemic perspective, when you are bigger you have these systems in place, and you do not have to guilt somebody into working a shift.

At the same time, they framed their efforts as improving fairness, accountability, and transparency in staffing practices. Pair-ing discussions of metrics—which break care down into constituent elements associated with industrial efficiency—with algorithms staffing practices—which technologists use to frame evaluation in domestic terms—reveals that these actors associate different parts of their job with distinct moral frameworks to meet a complex set of demands. Further, interviews with caregivers and coordinators reveal that these performance evaluation criteria and platform staffing practices are a source of tension and stress.4.3 Platform AsymmetriesWhat are the consequences of technologists’ actions? To answer this question, we turn to platform caregivers’ and care coordinators’ per-spectives and experiences. Contrary to technologists’ aspirations touse algorithms to build a fairer, more transparent order, algorithmic staffing practices in fact created new conditions of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. First, we focus on evaluation practices.CareTech’s app for caregivers displays ratings across several met-rics related to operational aspects of care delivery (i.e., timeliness,consistency, application usage, and call-offs). The platform also sends weekly caregiver evaluation surveys to coordinators but does not share this feedback directly with caregivers. Further, caregivers rarely received qualitative feedback regarding the quality of care they provided. Caregivers discussed how these aspects of platform design contributed to ambiguity regarding insight into their perfor-mance, while coordinators approached completing survey-based caregiver evaluations with ambivalence. Second, we analyze care-givers’ interactions with CareTech’s staffing practices. Caregivers described experiencing collapsed boundaries between working and personal time. Despite these new challenges, the caregivers and coordinators we interviewed did not mention a desire to leave. .4.3.1 Ambiguity and Ambivalence. While caregivers described providing care as meaningful and were generally content with the conditions they faced on the platform, they discussed a lack of clarity regarding expectations and performance. As Hayden said:I believe that the clients, they also rate us after every shift. So then if we get rated lowly every time or pretty consistently, I’m sure they will reach out tous...I don’t know that it helps us rate our care and how well we’re doing with our clients, but I don't know how else they could do that...you hear stories of people who are dissatisfied with their care, and that's hard to tell.It was only after connecting with other caregivers that Hayden Learned that it was possible to request a performance evaluation form CareTech. Further, the opacity of metrics created feelings of worry for care-givers about their performance. As a new caregiver on the platform,Hazel worried about a low client consistency rating and discussed needing to take the initiative to understand why she received low ratings across other metrics. Puzzled about low application usage ratings, Hazel described needing to reach out to CareTech to understand “what [she] was missing.” CareTech’s communication and evaluation practices created unclear situations with multiple interpretations and required additional labor on the part of caregivers to understand how care recipients experienced their care and how the platform judged their performance. Coordinators, on the other hand, discussed their own evaluation practices as infused with ambivalence—a finding that we found surprising given the intimate and impactful context of care for an older loved one. While coordinators described clear feelings about the care provided to loved ones, our interviewees responded to CareTech’s evaluation surveys inconsistently. Coordinators expressed satisfaction with the care that caregivers provided and thus did not feel a need to fill out the company’s weekly care-giver evaluation survey, described how these surveys were not as useful compared to in-person evaluations performed over more extended periods, or expressed that they did not feel their feedback through these outlets was listened to by CareTech. Phyllis—who lives with her care recipient—described that since the quality of care was so consistent, there was not a need to be very detailed in her evaluations: “they will send out those [surveys] weekly...soyou click on attentiveness, preparation, and I don’t remember what they all are. There’s about five of them. I don’t get very detailed.” On The other hand, Brooks—who did not live with his care recipient,and was dissatisfied with the consistency of staffing provided byCareTech—described feeling overwhelmed by the amount of eval-uating he was asked to do: “For each one of the caregivers that has been in, they’re asking for an opinion for eight to 10 caregivers everyMonday, on the same thing, the same people doing the same thing.I’ve had a hard time seeing the value on a weekly basis.” He saw more value in evaluations carried out over longer intervals as it had been before the acquisition. There used to be the quarterly report where they would actually go in and visit and come back and say,‘this has changed, or this looks like it’s changed’...when someone steps in four or five times a year those are the ones that can pick out some things.Opal, who uses CareTech to provide care to her husband, discussed her attitude towards the surveys: “Honestly, I ignore [the surveys]. It’s not something I want to do. I don’t know why. I know they're doing great.” These perspectives demonstrate a difference in the worth actors ascribed to particular evaluation practices, high-lighting a mismatch between technologists’, coordinators’, and care-givers’ perspectives. Other coordinators described non-use of CareTech’s evaluation infrastructure, even when there were striking departures from care expectations. Coordinators justified their approach by appealing to different moral frameworks. Riley said, “what did happen onetime, and I should probably be more tuned into it...there was one day when one of the caregivers didn’t show up at all. And I didn't know about it until the next day.” She justified the non-use through appeals to a domestic moral framework: “I’m not as hands-on, I’mnot looking at the app to see what they’re doing. I get my feedback on how they’re doing from my mom and dad.” Winnie, who relied on a caregiver to transport her mother to church on Sunday mornings, described situations where sometimes a caregiver assigned to the shift couldn’t drive or had no car. Even so, she did not fill out regular surveys, drawing on her experience as a business owner (industrial)to express that she understood the challenges of staffing shifts: “it’sa very hard thing to maneuver in the world that we’re walking in. We Own a small business. We employ 13 ladies, so I understand.” At the same time, she seemed to negatively moralize non-use: “I will be honest with you that a survey has come...I haven’t filled it out. So I Haven't done due diligence on my part. You know, so I’m going to own that part.” While some coordinators expressed frustration about consistency, communication, quality, and the efficacy of evaluation practices, they appealed to multiple moral frameworks to justify different uses of evaluation infrastructure.4.3.2 Work Practices and Professional Boundaries. Continued dis-cussion with caregivers provided insight into how the problems that technologists faced contributed to aspects of platform design.The need to fill open shifts and coordinate care work across multiple individuals—associated with an industrial moral framework—took precedence over other concerns. Francine’s account of interactions with CareTech provides an example of how the need to staff shifts devalued communication about performance: “they have never given me any feedback or evaluation, the only time they call is about the schedule, asking if you can work more.” We argue that technologists prioritization of needs associated with the industrial moral frame-work eroded the boundary between caregivers’ work and personal lives and changed care practices.For example, the platform uses a notification system to bring open shifts to caregivers’ attention. However, Pepper describe how the constant notification stream makes it difficult for her to differentiate between work and leisure time:I can tell they have a lot of shifts to fill in. Am I go-ing to be under pressure? They’ve asked me for five things, and you said no to all of them, it feels likeI should say yes to something now. It’s just a little harder to be either working or not working...when you see your phone in the morning and you see all those notifications there.Hayden described receiving “30 to 40” notifications a day from the app, even after reaching out to CareTech to express that they would not work any more shifts. Further, they described confu-sion and frustration regarding the processes by which shifts were initially assigned:I actually said no to [the shift], but they scheduled me anyway. Which was how I got a lot of my shifts,which was okay...I know sometimes it sounds weird,but I would say no to a shift, maybe they’d think thatI said yes.This account suggests that the platform does not allow for as much flexibility as technologists imagine.In contrast to legacy record-keeping procedures, where care-givers left paper-based care notes in clients’ homes, CareTech’splatform requires that caregivers describe their shifts upon clock-ing out in an electronic journal that is viewable by coordinators and other caregivers. While caregivers described that the journal helped them feel more prepared for each shift, they also described reading journal entries outside of working hours, which provided further evidence for blurred boundaries between work and personal life.For example, Chauncey described reading entries “at night, before Igo to bed, I start reading if I’m going to work the next morning.” In Addition, platform architecture requiring caregivers to complete these logs changed caregivers’ relationship to time spent on the job. Francine described how filling out the notes, especially in the time-sensitive context of a shift, placed pressure on how she spent time providing care: “if you clock out right at a minute after [your shift ends] they get you on that.” Efforts to avoid disciplinary action created new relationships to time: “I just always try to clock out a few minutes before because you get all these questions before closing out the app” (Francine). In these cases, platform architecture changed caregivers' relationships with their time both on and off the clock,which put caregivers under additional pressure.We found that aspects of platform and algorithm design create new forms of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. We argue that this results from a mismatch between technologists’ moral reasoning and that of other platform actors. In addition, the need to fill open shifts and coordinate work across many individuals pri-oritizes a logic of efficiency over concerns for caregiver job quality.Despite coordinators’ unmet expectations and new pressures that the platform placed on caregivers, both sets of actors maintain a commitment to the platform. A possible explanation for contin-ued attachment is the moral significance of ‘care.’ While the term carries various meanings across actors and situations, it may act as a resource that maintains a particular status quo by mitigating organized critique of or departure from the platform.

49,TechnologicalSolutionism,constrainsAgent,CareTech,"The subject of our case study, CareTech4, is one of several start-upsthat are credited with “reinventing the [home care] agency model”[22]. Prior to data collection, CareTech acquired StayHome, a traditional home care agency franchise. To contextualize our findings,we briefly discuss CareTech’s business model.CareTech partners with traditional home care agencies to support back-end administrative, legal, compliance, and logistics functions in exchange for a share of partner agencies’ revenue, employing caregivers directly. Caregivers assist with activities of daily living(i.e., bathing, dressing, getting in or out of a bed or chair, walking,using the toilet, eating) [43], and instrumental activities of daily living (i.e., cooking, cleaning, transportation, laundry, managing finances) [46]. CareTech’s use of algorithms to match caregivers to care recipients is central to our case. When we started data collection, CareTech’s technology platform had recently been im-plemented at StayHome’s company-owned agencies, providing a unique opportunity to investigate care algorithm implementation.In this paper, we focus primarily on CareTech’s staffing prac-tices. CareTech uses metrics and algorithms, along with human management, to staff shifts. Staffing algorithms have a role at two main sites: as initial schedules were made and when other care-givers called off their shifts. When caregivers are scheduled during their onboarding, staff members at CareTech use algorithmic recommendation systems to match caregivers with care recipients. Evaluation metrics (i.e., timeliness, consistency, application usage,and call-offs), along with other data (e.g., caregiver commute time,number of complaints) are used to match caregivers and care recipients. Coordinators receive weekly surveys about the quality of care provided, and provide responses on a linear scale5. After IRB approval, we recruited participants—technologists (n =14), caregivers (n = 9), and coordinators (n = 7)—through a partnership with CareTech and StayHome for interviews using convenience and purposive sampling [10]. StayHome’s research staff arranged site visit and helped recruit participants. We provided a brief description of the study and a screening questionnaire distributed amongst the caregivers and coordinators over email. This approach provided an opportunity to learn from technologists, caregivers,coordinators who were enthusiastic about sharing their experi-ences with the platform. Table 2 and table 3 provide an overview of participant profiles.(1) Technologists: Technologists consisted of software engi-neers, designers, product managers, and data and opera-tions workers. Software engineers talked about buildingCareTech’s features and the company’s history. Designers Develop CareTech’s front-end user experience for caregivers.Designers, the operations team, and a product manager described how they approached curating the caregiver experi-ence. The data scientists, data analysts, and data stewards dis-cussed the metrics used to measure caregiver performance,the data that staffing algorithms use, and how algorithms work in practice.(2) Caregivers: We use the term ‘caregivers’ to refer to the people employed by CareTech to provide care for pay.(3) Coordinators: The term ‘coordinators’ refers to people that pay for CareTech’s services and coordinate their delivery,usually on behalf of an older loved one. Recruiting interview participants through a partnership with Stay-Home and CareTech potentially biased results toward more positive perspectives of organizational practices. Caregivers and coordina-tors with more negative views about the company may have been reluctant to share their opinions or participate in interviews alto-gether due to fears of retaliation from the platform. Convenience Sampling limited the extent to which we were able to understand differences across demographic subgroups. Future work should explore this issue. Further, recruitment overlooked the perspectives of care coordinators and caregivers who have left the platform due to difficulties This study draws on data gathered from one week of observations performed in July 2022 and 30 interviews conducted between May2022 and August 2022. We conducted in-depth interviews to understand the cultural inputs that shape algorithm design and the implications for caregivers and coordinators. Interviews are well-suited for understanding social dimensions of how people interpret the world and take actions based on those interpretations [64]. Interviews with technology workers show how they make sense of their work and build systems [67], and interviews with caregivers and coordinators show that care practices diverge from organizational philosophy [53]. After several interviews, one researcher visitedStayHome’s global headquarters and a company-owned agency,located in a major Midwestern city in the U.S. The researcher toured the company’s offices and met with support staff. In addition, theresearcher engaged these actors in informal conversations to learn how StayHome and CareTech operate. To understand how the plat-form is presented to caregivers and what aspects of paid care work are emphasized, the researcher observed a caregiver training ses-sion on lifting and transferring techniques at one of StayHome’scompany-owned franchises and attended a virtual onboarding ses-sion with CareTech in the afternoon.We developed the interview guide with interest in valuation and evaluation practices as they occur on CareTech’s platform. Treating valuation as a moral outlook, we drew on practice-oriented approaches to understanding how different actors conceptualize and contribute value in labor contexts [36]. Examining the practices of the people that develop platforms and those who are subject to their architecture provides an opportunity to identify the underlying justifications and actions that shape and transform care work as it occurs on the ground. Interview questions thus sought to elicit interviewees' daily practices, what elements of their work they described as most important, the least favorite aspects of their work,and their ideological orientation towards the concept of ‘care.’After obtaining consent, we recorded the interviews, which lasted between 45 and 90 minutes and took place mainly over Zoom. However, we did interview several caregivers and one coordinator in person. Team members iteratively refined these themes through discussion and mapped them to the EoW framework. We used a third-party qualitative coding tool (NVivo) to complete the coding process. To make theoretical sense of the data, we returned to the literature and iterated between data and extant research. Our findings indicate that technologists drew on several economies of worth—which we refer to as moral frameworks—to navigate the seemingly irreconcilable demands of home care. They referenced multiple interpretations of the term ‘care’ to resolve contradictions.We illustrate this point by first focusing on how technologists described the problems that they claim to solve. Then, we analyze the nature of the solutions they presented, highlighting how technolo-gists imbued different aspects of algorithm design and function with moral meanings. This finding demonstrates the interpretive flexibil-ity of technological artifacts. Finally, we turn to the perspectives of caregivers and coordinators. Their accounts show how algorithmic staffing practices created new forms of uncertainty—the mirror of technologists' stated intentions.4.1 Navigating Contextual ComplexityTechnologists drew on multiple moral frameworks to navigate expectations and demands, appealing to various interpretations of care’ to reconcile the contradictory pressures they face. The technologists we interviewed framed CareTech as a platform developed to address traditional home care agencies’ logistical and opera-tional challenges. In this context, they appealed to an industrial moral framework, framing their work as introducing greater levels of efficiency and rationalization to the home care industry. How-ever, many of the technologists we interviewed also framed their work in terms of a civic moral framework, critiquing prior staffing practices as subjective, opaque, unfair, and harmful to the material well-being of caregivers. Although these two narratives may appear contradictory, technologists unified these demands by appealing to the societal need for more care. For example, improvements inefficiency were discussed in terms of increasing the affordability of care while improving working conditions was imagined as growing the size of the caregiving workforce. We argue that technologists navigate complexity when creating and developing care algorithms by strategically appealing to justifications corresponding to differ-ent moral frameworks, drawing on multiple interpretations of a single term to move between them. Throughout this section, we draw attention to how technologists position algorithmic staffing practices as one solution to the problems they described.4.1.1 Platform Description & Motivations. The rhetoric that tech-nologists and company executives used to describe their motivation for building the platform appealed to domestic and social goods. In press releases and on the company website, CareTech’s execu-tives described their frustrations in searching for care for their own parents. Similarly, technologists invoked ideas of familial respon-sibility, relaying stories about their difficulties in finding care for aging parents. Technologists also drew on more civic-oriented no-tions of good, framing their work with reference to positive social change. For example, Richard described, “being part of something that can have a positive impact on society.” The company’s mission statement, was described as ‘improving care in society6, highlight-ing the significance of a single moral concept in technologists discourse.In discussing the company’s strategy, the technologists we in-terviewed described CareTech as a “platform,” “communication company,” or “logistical engine,”, foregrounding CareTech’s use of digital technology to improve efficiency, and framed their work asa response to logistical challenges in the home care industry. Aiden described what he framed as the company’s main value proposition:I think the big sort of sell is, it is getting harder and harder to operate care. I think it is getting more expensive...the core value proposition is where we are trying to figure out how to build a platform around doing this, and helping agencies focus more on their relationships with their communities and customers.He elaborated that, by centralizing operations, CareTech offers partner agencies relief from work that is “consuming and grueling,whether it’s paperwork, management, documentation, staffing, lo-gistics, or being on call all the time.” By filling this role, CareTech‘frees up agencies to both source customers and maintain that rela-tionship and kind of connection’ (Aiden). Repeated references to the relationship between CareTech and the agencies with which it partners serve two purposes. First, they identify areas whereCareTech uses technology to increase efficiency in the home care industry. This problem formulation provides the background for how organizational solutions are framed. Second, they format a division of labor. In this account, partner agencies are positioned as responsible for managing relationships in local markets, while the platform oversees aspects of labor control and management.Here, technologists frame the platform’s work in industrial terms and partner agencies in domestic terms. 4.1.2 Staffing Practices as Solutions. As they justified their work,technologists also blended elements from multiple moral frame-works. Specifically, they simultaneously appealed to notions of market dominance and civic responsibility. This overlap materialized as Robert, a data scientist, stated that the company’s scale offered a ‘unified view across markets’ and provided access to a sufficient amount of data to use statistical techniques to ‘learn from the data to provide better home care’, serving as a “competitive dif-ferentiator in the market.” In addition, Floyd framed the company's size as affording more ‘careful’ staffing practice:From a systemic perspective, when you are bigger you have these systems in place, and you do not have to guilt somebody into working a shift. If you need a shift filled, you have a stable of hundreds of caregivers you can reach out to, it is just a matter of how much bonus you have to put on it.These rhetorical strategies demonstrate how technologists draw on multiple moral frameworks to present their work as solutions to different problems.Building on discussions of CareTech’s organizational strategy,technologists most concretely articulated their efforts toward ‘im-proving care in society’ through labor management. They started these discussions by problematizing caregiver job quality under legacy home care practices as associated with low wages, few ben-efits, rigid scheduling practices, and little recognition of caregivers efforts. Kennedy critiqued legacy staffing practices on the grounds of fairness and transparency:There’s a lot of favoritism that happens. There’s a lack of transparency. And so as you can imagine, the caregivers who work the most shifts, they’re able to earn the most amount of money. And that’s really helping to improve their lives and livelihoods. Other technologists framed algorithmic staffing as a solution to the legacy staffing practices that Kennedy identified as opaque and unfair. While Kennedy incorporated concerns about material well-being into her critiques, other technologists generally avoided discussing their efforts toward increasing caregiver job quality in terms of a market-based moral framework. This may have resulted from the market constraints of care, where the price for private pay home care is inaccessible for many families. Aria explainedthat raising wages for caregivers would make the price of care“unpayable” by many clients. 4.1.3 Professionalizing Care. Instead, technologists framed their efforts as attempts to improve caregivers’ status and provide them with a career. Aria noted that improving the collective status of caregivers was part of CareTech’s mission since its founding, em-phasizing challenging aspects of the job:I think that a really big piece of what CareTech is try-ing to do and has been trying to do since the beginning you know, elevate the profession of caregiving. Andtruly treat it a profession instead of just a job...because it's a difficult, emotionally intense, sometimes physi-cally intense thing to do.Floyd described further aspirations to elevate caregivers’ status through professionalization:I would say that [career] is a north star for us. I think everyone views that as an innovation that we can and should make, and the profession is worth it... we're working towards it, but we haven’t actually gotten there yet.These discussions highlight the links that technologists establish between different moral frameworks as they respond to a complex set of challenges. While they expressed concern about the value that care holds in society, increasing the pecuniary value of car was viewed as infeasible. Technologists responded to this problem by appealing to the status of the profession. However, technologists most defined solutions came in the form of staffing algorithms.4.2 Datafying CareWe unpack staffing practices at CareTech, which we argue are emblematic of technological solutionism. Our analysis reveals that technologists associated different aspects of staffing algorithms with different moral frameworks. We argue that how decisions are made about who is best suited for particular shifts—and why—is changing with the advent and implementation of algorithmic staffing tools as technologists prioritize efficiency. However, discussions with technologists show that there are tensions present in the use of algorithms. On the one hand, technologists discussed their work in terms of trying to increase caregiver performance. Performance Evaluation metrics break care into a set of constituent elements closely aligned with operational efficiency (an appeal to the indus-trial moral framework). On the other hand, technologists described their work as oriented toward establishing long-term relationships between caregivers and care recipients (an appeal to the domestic moral framework).The metrics and measurements that support algorithmic staffing practices are most closely associated with notions of productivity and operational efficiency. Technologists presented one part of their work as oriented toward increasing the “performance, or perceived performance of the caregiver” (Floyd). They described how this work is accomplished by measuring: (1) timeliness (how frequently a caregiver arrives to a shift on time); (2) consistency (adherence to schedule shifts); (3) application usage (whether or not the caregiver uses the application to clock in to and out of shifts and evaluate care recipient well-being); and (4) call-offs (shifts not released seven days in advance). While this evaluation practice makes care legible based on a discrete set of metrics, the composition of these metrics is oriented toward operational efficiency rather than the experiences of care recipients or care coordinators.Technologists contrasted their work with platforms in the ride-hailing industry7, describing how their work was motivated by the desire to establish long-term relationships between caregivers and care recipients. They referenced algorithms in terms that framed care as a holistic practice, often comparing the product of their work to other intimate relationships. Staffing algorithms have a role at two main sites: as initial schedules were made and when other caregivers called off their shifts. When caregivers are scheduled during their onboarding, staff members at CareTech use algorithmic recommendation systems to match caregivers with care recipients.In both cases, platform architects compared the matching process to other intimate relations between caregivers and care recipients.In Sandra’s words: Once the data are all collected, [the algorithm] gives us a list of caregivers, and it was ranked by most likely to be picked up by the caregiver...there is a...I don't want to say negotiating, but there are conversations that go back and forth. Because it does become an arranged marriage when you’re putting it inside thehome.In instances where shifts opened up with clients, the platform gives caregivers the option to pick up shifts with these clients through a user interface that Floyd described as “not not tinder 8 inspired. In advancing these relationship-based arguments, technologists define quality care by referencing domestic relationships between caregivers and care recipients.On the one hand, technologists seek to build a platform that effi-ciently delivers consistent care to a growing number of older adult care recipients. On the other, they describe their work as motivated by a desire to optimize relationships between caregivers and care recipients. At the same time, they framed their efforts as improving fairness, accountability, and transparency in staffing practices. Pair-ing discussions of metrics—which break care down into constituent elements associated with industrial efficiency—with algorithms staffing practices—which technologists use to frame evaluation in domestic terms—reveals that these actors associate different parts of their job with distinct moral frameworks to meet a complex set of demands. Further, interviews with caregivers and coordinators reveal that these performance evaluation criteria and platform staffing practices are a source of tension and stress.4.3 Platform AsymmetriesWhat are the consequences of technologists’ actions? To answer this question, we turn to platform caregivers’ and care coordinators’ per-spectives and experiences. Contrary to technologists’ aspirations touse algorithms to build a fairer, more transparent order, algorithmic staffing practices in fact created new conditions of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. First, we focus on evaluation practices.CareTech’s app for caregivers displays ratings across several met-rics related to operational aspects of care delivery (i.e., timeliness,consistency, application usage, and call-offs). The platform also sends weekly caregiver evaluation surveys to coordinators but does not share this feedback directly with caregivers. Further, caregivers rarely received qualitative feedback regarding the quality of care they provided. Caregivers discussed how these aspects of platform design contributed to ambiguity regarding insight into their perfor-mance, while coordinators approached completing survey-based caregiver evaluations with ambivalence. Second, we analyze care-givers’ interactions with CareTech’s staffing practices. Caregivers described experiencing collapsed boundaries between working and personal time.

Further, the opacity of metrics created feelings of worry for care-givers about their performance. As a new caregiver on the platform,Hazel worried about a low client consistency rating and discussed needing to take the initiative to understand why she received low ratings across other metrics. Puzzled about low application usage ratings, Hazel described needing to reach out to CareTech to understand “what [she] was missing.” CareTech’s communication and evaluation practices created unclear situations with multiple interpretations and required additional labor on the part of caregivers to understand how care recipients experienced their care and how the platform judged their performance. Coordinators, on the other hand, discussed their own evaluation practices as infused with ambivalence—a finding that we found surprising given the intimate and impactful context of care for an older loved one.

We Own a small business. We employ 13 ladies, so I understand.” At the same time, she seemed to negatively moralize non-use: “I will be honest with you that a survey has come...I haven’t filled it out. So I Haven't done due diligence on my part. You know, so I’m going to own that part.” While some coordinators expressed frustration about consistency, communication, quality, and the efficacy of evaluation practices, they appealed to multiple moral frameworks to justify different uses of evaluation infrastructure.4.3.2 Work Practices and Professional Boundaries. Continued dis-cussion with caregivers provided insight into how the problems that technologists faced contributed to aspects of platform design.The need to fill open shifts and coordinate care work across multiple individuals—associated with an industrial moral framework—took precedence over other concerns.

Further, they described confu-sion and frustration regarding the processes by which shifts were initially assigned:I actually said no to [the shift], but they scheduled me anyway.

50,IncreaseCareGiverPerformance,constrainsAgent,Technologists,"The subject of our case study, CareTech4, is one of several start-upsthat are credited with “reinventing the [home care] agency model”[22]. Prior to data collection, CareTech acquired StayHome, a traditional home care agency franchise. To contextualize our findings,we briefly discuss CareTech’s business model.CareTech partners with traditional home care agencies to support back-end administrative, legal, compliance, and logistics functions in exchange for a share of partner agencies’ revenue, employing caregivers directly. Caregivers assist with activities of daily living(i.e., bathing, dressing, getting in or out of a bed or chair, walking,using the toilet, eating) [43], and instrumental activities of daily living (i.e., cooking, cleaning, transportation, laundry, managing finances) [46]. CareTech’s use of algorithms to match caregivers to care recipients is central to our case. When we started data collection, CareTech’s technology platform had recently been im-plemented at StayHome’s company-owned agencies, providing a unique opportunity to investigate care algorithm implementation.In this paper, we focus primarily on CareTech’s staffing prac-tices. CareTech uses metrics and algorithms, along with human management, to staff shifts. Staffing algorithms have a role at two main sites: as initial schedules were made and when other care-givers called off their shifts. When caregivers are scheduled during their onboarding, staff members at CareTech use algorithmic recommendation systems to match caregivers with care recipients. Evaluation metrics (i.e., timeliness, consistency, application usage,and call-offs), along with other data (e.g., caregiver commute time,number of complaints) are used to match caregivers and care recipients. Coordinators receive weekly surveys about the quality of care provided, and provide responses on a linear scale5. After IRB approval, we recruited participants—technologists (n =14), caregivers (n = 9), and coordinators (n = 7)—through a partnership with CareTech and StayHome for interviews using convenience and purposive sampling [10]. StayHome’s research staff arranged site visit and helped recruit participants. We provided a brief description of the study and a screening questionnaire distributed amongst the caregivers and coordinators over email.

Convenience Sampling limited the extent to which we were able to understand differences across demographic subgroups. Future work should explore this issue. Further, recruitment overlooked the perspectives of care coordinators and caregivers who have left the platform due to difficulties This study draws on data gathered from one week of observations performed in July 2022 and 30 interviews conducted between May2022 and August 2022. We conducted in-depth interviews to understand the cultural inputs that shape algorithm design and the implications for caregivers and coordinators. Interviews are well-suited for understanding social dimensions of how people interpret the world and take actions based on those interpretations [64]. Interviews with technology workers show how they make sense of their work and build systems [67], and interviews with caregivers and coordinators show that care practices diverge from organizational philosophy [53]. After several interviews, one researcher visitedStayHome’s global headquarters and a company-owned agency,located in a major Midwestern city in the U.S. The researcher toured the company’s offices and met with support staff. In addition, theresearcher engaged these actors in informal conversations to learn how StayHome and CareTech operate. To understand how the plat-form is presented to caregivers and what aspects of paid care work are emphasized, the researcher observed a caregiver training ses-sion on lifting and transferring techniques at one of StayHome’scompany-owned franchises and attended a virtual onboarding ses-sion with CareTech in the afternoon.We developed the interview guide with interest in valuation and evaluation practices as they occur on CareTech’s platform. Treating valuation as a moral outlook, we drew on practice-oriented approaches to understanding how different actors conceptualize and contribute value in labor contexts [36]. Examining the practices of the people that develop platforms and those who are subject to their architecture provides an opportunity to identify the underlying justifications and actions that shape and transform care work as it occurs on the ground. Interview questions thus sought to elicit interviewees' daily practices, what elements of their work they described as most important, the least favorite aspects of their work,and their ideological orientation towards the concept of ‘care.’After obtaining consent, we recorded the interviews, which lasted between 45 and 90 minutes and took place mainly over Zoom. However, we did interview several caregivers and one coordinator in person. Team members iteratively refined these themes through discussion and mapped them to the EoW framework. We used a third-party qualitative coding tool (NVivo) to complete the coding process. To make theoretical sense of the data, we returned to the literature and iterated between data and extant research. Our findings indicate that technologists drew on several economies of worth—which we refer to as moral frameworks—to navigate the seemingly irreconcilable demands of home care. They referenced multiple interpretations of the term ‘care’ to resolve contradictions.We illustrate this point by first focusing on how technologists described the problems that they claim to solve. Then, we analyze the nature of the solutions they presented, highlighting how technolo-gists imbued different aspects of algorithm design and function with moral meanings. This finding demonstrates the interpretive flexibil-ity of technological artifacts. Finally, we turn to the perspectives of caregivers and coordinators. Their accounts show how algorithmic staffing practices created new forms of uncertainty—the mirror of technologists' stated intentions.4.1 Navigating Contextual ComplexityTechnologists drew on multiple moral frameworks to navigate expectations and demands, appealing to various interpretations of care’ to reconcile the contradictory pressures they face. The technologists we interviewed framed CareTech as a platform developed to address traditional home care agencies’ logistical and opera-tional challenges. In this context, they appealed to an industrial moral framework, framing their work as introducing greater levels of efficiency and rationalization to the home care industry. How-ever, many of the technologists we interviewed also framed their work in terms of a civic moral framework, critiquing prior staffing practices as subjective, opaque, unfair, and harmful to the material well-being of caregivers. Although these two narratives may appear contradictory, technologists unified these demands by appealing to the societal need for more care. For example, improvements inefficiency were discussed in terms of increasing the affordability of care while improving working conditions was imagined as growing the size of the caregiving workforce. We argue that technologists navigate complexity when creating and developing care algorithms by strategically appealing to justifications corresponding to differ-ent moral frameworks, drawing on multiple interpretations of a single term to move between them. Throughout this section, we draw attention to how technologists position algorithmic staffing practices as one solution to the problems they described.4.1.1 Platform Description & Motivations. The rhetoric that tech-nologists and company executives used to describe their motivation for building the platform appealed to domestic and social goods. In press releases and on the company website, CareTech’s execu-tives described their frustrations in searching for care for their own parents. Similarly, technologists invoked ideas of familial respon-sibility, relaying stories about their difficulties in finding care for aging parents. Technologists also drew on more civic-oriented no-tions of good, framing their work with reference to positive social change. For example, Richard described, “being part of something that can have a positive impact on society.” The company’s mission statement, was described as ‘improving care in society6, highlight-ing the significance of a single moral concept in technologists discourse.In discussing the company’s strategy, the technologists we in-terviewed described CareTech as a “platform,” “communication company,” or “logistical engine,”, foregrounding CareTech’s use of digital technology to improve efficiency, and framed their work asa response to logistical challenges in the home care industry. Aiden described what he framed as the company’s main value proposition:I think the big sort of sell is, it is getting harder and harder to operate care. I think it is getting more expensive...the core value proposition is where we are trying to figure out how to build a platform around doing this, and helping agencies focus more on their relationships with their communities and customers.He elaborated that, by centralizing operations, CareTech offers partner agencies relief from work that is “consuming and grueling,whether it’s paperwork, management, documentation, staffing, lo-gistics, or being on call all the time.” By filling this role, CareTech‘frees up agencies to both source customers and maintain that rela-tionship and kind of connection’ (Aiden). Repeated references to the relationship between CareTech and the agencies with which it partners serve two purposes. First, they identify areas whereCareTech uses technology to increase efficiency in the home care industry. This problem formulation provides the background for how organizational solutions are framed. Second, they format a division of labor. In this account, partner agencies are positioned as responsible for managing relationships in local markets, while the platform oversees aspects of labor control and management.Here, technologists frame the platform’s work in industrial terms and partner agencies in domestic terms. 4.1.2 Staffing Practices as Solutions. As they justified their work,technologists also blended elements from multiple moral frame-works. Specifically, they simultaneously appealed to notions of market dominance and civic responsibility. This overlap materialized as Robert, a data scientist, stated that the company’s scale offered a ‘unified view across markets’ and provided access to a sufficient amount of data to use statistical techniques to ‘learn from the data to provide better home care’, serving as a “competitive dif-ferentiator in the market.” In addition, Floyd framed the company's size as affording more ‘careful’ staffing practice:From a systemic perspective, when you are bigger you have these systems in place, and you do not have to guilt somebody into working a shift. If you need a shift filled, you have a stable of hundreds of caregivers you can reach out to, it is just a matter of how much bonus you have to put on it.These rhetorical strategies demonstrate how technologists draw on multiple moral frameworks to present their work as solutions to different problems.Building on discussions of CareTech’s organizational strategy,technologists most concretely articulated their efforts toward ‘im-proving care in society’ through labor management. They started these discussions by problematizing caregiver job quality under legacy home care practices as associated with low wages, few ben-efits, rigid scheduling practices, and little recognition of caregivers efforts. Kennedy critiqued legacy staffing practices on the grounds of fairness and transparency:There’s a lot of favoritism that happens. There’s a lack of transparency. And so as you can imagine, the caregivers who work the most shifts, they’re able to earn the most amount of money. And that’s really helping to improve their lives and livelihoods. Other technologists framed algorithmic staffing as a solution to the legacy staffing practices that Kennedy identified as opaque and unfair. While Kennedy incorporated concerns about material well-being into her critiques, other technologists generally avoided discussing their efforts toward increasing caregiver job quality in terms of a market-based moral framework. This may have resulted from the market constraints of care, where the price for private pay home care is inaccessible for many families. Aria explainedthat raising wages for caregivers would make the price of care“unpayable” by many clients. 4.1.3 Professionalizing Care. Instead, technologists framed their efforts as attempts to improve caregivers’ status and provide them with a career. Aria noted that improving the collective status of caregivers was part of CareTech’s mission since its founding, em-phasizing challenging aspects of the job:I think that a really big piece of what CareTech is try-ing to do and has been trying to do since the beginning you know, elevate the profession of caregiving. Andtruly treat it a profession instead of just a job...because it's a difficult, emotionally intense, sometimes physi-cally intense thing to do.Floyd described further aspirations to elevate caregivers’ status through professionalization:I would say that [career] is a north star for us. I think everyone views that as an innovation that we can and should make, and the profession is worth it... we're working towards it, but we haven’t actually gotten there yet.These discussions highlight the links that technologists establish between different moral frameworks as they respond to a complex set of challenges. While they expressed concern about the value that care holds in society, increasing the pecuniary value of car was viewed as infeasible. Technologists responded to this problem by appealing to the status of the profession. However, technologists most defined solutions came in the form of staffing algorithms.4.2 Datafying CareWe unpack staffing practices at CareTech, which we argue are emblematic of technological solutionism. Our analysis reveals that technologists associated different aspects of staffing algorithms with different moral frameworks. We argue that how decisions are made about who is best suited for particular shifts—and why—is changing with the advent and implementation of algorithmic staffing tools as technologists prioritize efficiency. However, discussions with technologists show that there are tensions present in the use of algorithms. On the one hand, technologists discussed their work in terms of trying to increase caregiver performance. Performance Evaluation metrics break care into a set of constituent elements closely aligned with operational efficiency (an appeal to the indus-trial moral framework). On the other hand, technologists described their work as oriented toward establishing long-term relationships between caregivers and care recipients (an appeal to the domestic moral framework).The metrics and measurements that support algorithmic staffing practices are most closely associated with notions of productivity and operational efficiency. Technologists presented one part of their work as oriented toward increasing the “performance, or perceived performance of the caregiver” (Floyd). They described how this work is accomplished by measuring: (1) timeliness (how frequently a caregiver arrives to a shift on time); (2) consistency (adherence to schedule shifts); (3) application usage (whether or not the caregiver uses the application to clock in to and out of shifts and evaluate care recipient well-being); and (4) call-offs (shifts not released seven days in advance). While this evaluation practice makes care legible based on a discrete set of metrics, the composition of these metrics is oriented toward operational efficiency rather than the experiences of care recipients or care coordinators.Technologists contrasted their work with platforms in the ride-hailing industry7, describing how their work was motivated by the desire to establish long-term relationships between caregivers and care recipients. They referenced algorithms in terms that framed care as a holistic practice, often comparing the product of their work to other intimate relationships. Staffing algorithms have a role at two main sites: as initial schedules were made and when other caregivers called off their shifts. When caregivers are scheduled during their onboarding, staff members at CareTech use algorithmic recommendation systems to match caregivers with care recipients.In both cases, platform architects compared the matching process to other intimate relations between caregivers and care recipients.In Sandra’s words: Once the data are all collected, [the algorithm] gives us a list of caregivers, and it was ranked by most likely to be picked up by the caregiver...there is a...I don't want to say negotiating, but there are conversations that go back and forth. Because it does become an arranged marriage when you’re putting it inside thehome.In instances where shifts opened up with clients, the platform gives caregivers the option to pick up shifts with these clients through a user interface that Floyd described as “not not tinder 8 inspired. In advancing these relationship-based arguments, technologists define quality care by referencing domestic relationships between caregivers and care recipients.On the one hand, technologists seek to build a platform that effi-ciently delivers consistent care to a growing number of older adult care recipients. On the other, they describe their work as motivated by a desire to optimize relationships between caregivers and care recipients. At the same time, they framed their efforts as improving fairness, accountability, and transparency in staffing practices. Pair-ing discussions of metrics—which break care down into constituent elements associated with industrial efficiency—with algorithms staffing practices—which technologists use to frame evaluation in domestic terms—reveals that these actors associate different parts of their job with distinct moral frameworks to meet a complex set of demands. Further, interviews with caregivers and coordinators reveal that these performance evaluation criteria and platform staffing practices are a source of tension and stress.4.3 Platform AsymmetriesWhat are the consequences of technologists’ actions? To answer this question, we turn to platform caregivers’ and care coordinators’ per-spectives and experiences. Contrary to technologists’ aspirations touse algorithms to build a fairer, more transparent order, algorithmic staffing practices in fact created new conditions of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. First, we focus on evaluation practices.CareTech’s app for caregivers displays ratings across several met-rics related to operational aspects of care delivery (i.e., timeliness,consistency, application usage, and call-offs). The platform also sends weekly caregiver evaluation surveys to coordinators but does not share this feedback directly with caregivers. Further, caregivers rarely received qualitative feedback regarding the quality of care they provided. Caregivers discussed how these aspects of platform design contributed to ambiguity regarding insight into their perfor-mance, while coordinators approached completing survey-based caregiver evaluations with ambivalence. Second, we analyze care-givers’ interactions with CareTech’s staffing practices. Caregivers described experiencing collapsed boundaries between working and personal time. Despite these new challenges, the caregivers and coordinators we interviewed did not mention a desire to leave. .4.3.1 Ambiguity and Ambivalence. While caregivers described providing care as meaningful and were generally content with the conditions they faced on the platform, they discussed a lack of clarity regarding expectations and performance. As Hayden said:I believe that the clients, they also rate us after every shift. So then if we get rated lowly every time or pretty consistently, I’m sure they will reach out tous...I don’t know that it helps us rate our care and how well we’re doing with our clients, but I don't know how else they could do that...you hear stories of people who are dissatisfied with their care, and that's hard to tell.It was only after connecting with other caregivers that Hayden Learned that it was possible to request a performance evaluation form CareTech. Further, the opacity of metrics created feelings of worry for care-givers about their performance. As a new caregiver on the platform,Hazel worried about a low client consistency rating and discussed needing to take the initiative to understand why she received low ratings across other metrics. Puzzled about low application usage ratings, Hazel described needing to reach out to CareTech to understand “what [she] was missing.” CareTech’s communication and evaluation practices created unclear situations with multiple interpretations and required additional labor on the part of caregivers to understand how care recipients experienced their care and how the platform judged their performance. Coordinators, on the other hand, discussed their own evaluation practices as infused with ambivalence—a finding that we found surprising given the intimate and impactful context of care for an older loved one. While coordinators described clear feelings about the care provided to loved ones, our interviewees responded to CareTech’s evaluation surveys inconsistently. Coordinators expressed satisfaction with the care that caregivers provided and thus did not feel a need to fill out the company’s weekly care-giver evaluation survey, described how these surveys were not as useful compared to in-person evaluations performed over more extended periods, or expressed that they did not feel their feedback through these outlets was listened to by CareTech. Phyllis—who lives with her care recipient—described that since the quality of care was so consistent, there was not a need to be very detailed in her evaluations: “they will send out those [surveys] weekly...soyou click on attentiveness, preparation, and I don’t remember what they all are. There’s about five of them. I don’t get very detailed.” On The other hand, Brooks—who did not live with his care recipient,and was dissatisfied with the consistency of staffing provided byCareTech—described feeling overwhelmed by the amount of eval-uating he was asked to do: “For each one of the caregivers that has been in, they’re asking for an opinion for eight to 10 caregivers everyMonday, on the same thing, the same people doing the same thing.I’ve had a hard time seeing the value on a weekly basis.” He saw more value in evaluations carried out over longer intervals as it had been before the acquisition. There used to be the quarterly report where they would actually go in and visit and come back and say,‘this has changed, or this looks like it’s changed’...when someone steps in four or five times a year those are the ones that can pick out some things.Opal, who uses CareTech to provide care to her husband, discussed her attitude towards the surveys: “Honestly, I ignore [the surveys]. It’s not something I want to do. I don’t know why. I know they're doing great.” These perspectives demonstrate a difference in the worth actors ascribed to particular evaluation practices, high-lighting a mismatch between technologists’, coordinators’, and care-givers’ perspectives. Other coordinators described non-use of CareTech’s evaluation infrastructure, even when there were striking departures from care expectations. Coordinators justified their approach by appealing to different moral frameworks. Riley said, “what did happen onetime, and I should probably be more tuned into it...there was one day when one of the caregivers didn’t show up at all. And I didn't know about it until the next day.” She justified the non-use through appeals to a domestic moral framework: “I’m not as hands-on, I’mnot looking at the app to see what they’re doing. I get my feedback on how they’re doing from my mom and dad.” Winnie, who relied on a caregiver to transport her mother to church on Sunday mornings, described situations where sometimes a caregiver assigned to the shift couldn’t drive or had no car. Even so, she did not fill out regular surveys, drawing on her experience as a business owner (industrial)to express that she understood the challenges of staffing shifts: “it’sa very hard thing to maneuver in the world that we’re walking in. We Own a small business. We employ 13 ladies, so I understand.” At the same time, she seemed to negatively moralize non-use: “I will be honest with you that a survey has come...I haven’t filled it out. So I Haven't done due diligence on my part. You know, so I’m going to own that part.” While some coordinators expressed frustration about consistency, communication, quality, and the efficacy of evaluation practices, they appealed to multiple moral frameworks to justify different uses of evaluation infrastructure.4.3.2 Work Practices and Professional Boundaries. Continued dis-cussion with caregivers provided insight into how the problems that technologists faced contributed to aspects of platform design.The need to fill open shifts and coordinate care work across multiple individuals—associated with an industrial moral framework—took precedence over other concerns. Francine’s account of interactions with CareTech provides an example of how the need to staff shifts devalued communication about performance: “they have never given me any feedback or evaluation, the only time they call is about the schedule, asking if you can work more.” We argue that technologists prioritization of needs associated with the industrial moral frame-work eroded the boundary between caregivers’ work and personal lives and changed care practices.For example, the platform uses a notification system to bring open shifts to caregivers’ attention. However, Pepper describe how the constant notification stream makes it difficult for her to differentiate between work and leisure time:I can tell they have a lot of shifts to fill in. Am I go-ing to be under pressure? They’ve asked me for five things, and you said no to all of them, it feels likeI should say yes to something now. It’s just a little harder to be either working or not working...when you see your phone in the morning and you see all those notifications there.Hayden described receiving “30 to 40” notifications a day from the app, even after reaching out to CareTech to express that they would not work any more shifts. Further, they described confu-sion and frustration regarding the processes by which shifts were initially assigned:I actually said no to [the shift], but they scheduled me anyway. Which was how I got a lot of my shifts,which was okay...I know sometimes it sounds weird,but I would say no to a shift, maybe they’d think thatI said yes.This account suggests that the platform does not allow for as much flexibility as technologists imagine.In contrast to legacy record-keeping procedures, where care-givers left paper-based care notes in clients’ homes, CareTech’splatform requires that caregivers describe their shifts upon clock-ing out in an electronic journal that is viewable by coordinators and other caregivers. While caregivers described that the journal helped them feel more prepared for each shift, they also described reading journal entries outside of working hours, which provided further evidence for blurred boundaries between work and personal life.For example, Chauncey described reading entries “at night, before Igo to bed, I start reading if I’m going to work the next morning.” In Addition, platform architecture requiring caregivers to complete these logs changed caregivers’ relationship to time spent on the job. Francine described how filling out the notes, especially in the time-sensitive context of a shift, placed pressure on how she spent time providing care: “if you clock out right at a minute after [your shift ends] they get you on that.” Efforts to avoid disciplinary action created new relationships to time: “I just always try to clock out a few minutes before because you get all these questions before closing out the app” (Francine). In these cases, platform architecture changed caregivers' relationships with their time both on and off the clock,which put caregivers under additional pressure.We found that aspects of platform and algorithm design create new forms of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. We argue that this results from a mismatch between technologists’ moral reasoning and that of other platform actors. In addition, the need to fill open shifts and coordinate work across many individuals pri-oritizes a logic of efficiency over concerns for caregiver job quality.Despite coordinators’ unmet expectations and new pressures that the platform placed on caregivers, both sets of actors maintain a commitment to the platform. A possible explanation for contin-ued attachment is the moral significance of ‘care.’ While the term carries various meanings across actors and situations, it may act as a resource that maintains a particular status quo by mitigating organized critique of or departure from the platform.

Our findings indicate that technologists drew on several economies of worth—which we refer to as moral frameworks—to navigate the seemingly irreconcilable demands of home care. They referenced multiple interpretations of the term ‘care’ to resolve contradictions.We illustrate this point by first focusing on how technologists described the problems that they claim to solve. Then, we analyze the nature of the solutions they presented, highlighting how technolo-gists imbued different aspects of algorithm design and function with moral meanings. This finding demonstrates the interpretive flexibil-ity of technological artifacts. Finally, we turn to the perspectives of caregivers and coordinators. Their accounts show how algorithmic staffing practices created new forms of uncertainty—the mirror of technologists' stated intentions.4.1 Navigating Contextual ComplexityTechnologists drew on multiple moral frameworks to navigate expectations and demands, appealing to various interpretations of care’ to reconcile the contradictory pressures they face. The technologists we interviewed framed CareTech as a platform developed to address traditional home care agencies’ logistical and opera-tional challenges. In this context, they appealed to an industrial moral framework, framing their work as introducing greater levels of efficiency and rationalization to the home care industry. How-ever, many of the technologists we interviewed also framed their work in terms of a civic moral framework, critiquing prior staffing practices as subjective, opaque, unfair, and harmful to the material well-being of caregivers. Although these two narratives may appear contradictory, technologists unified these demands by appealing to the societal need for more care. For example, improvements inefficiency were discussed in terms of increasing the affordability of care while improving working conditions was imagined as growing the size of the caregiving workforce. We argue that technologists navigate complexity when creating and developing care algorithms by strategically appealing to justifications corresponding to differ-ent moral frameworks, drawing on multiple interpretations of a single term to move between them. Throughout this section, we draw attention to how technologists position algorithmic staffing practices as one solution to the problems they described.4.1.1 Platform Description & Motivations. The rhetoric that tech-nologists and company executives used to describe their motivation for building the platform appealed to domestic and social goods. In press releases and on the company website, CareTech’s execu-tives described their frustrations in searching for care for their own parents. Similarly, technologists invoked ideas of familial respon-sibility, relaying stories about their difficulties in finding care for aging parents. Technologists also drew on more civic-oriented no-tions of good, framing their work with reference to positive social change. For example, Richard described, “being part of something that can have a positive impact on society.” The company’s mission statement, was described as ‘improving care in society6, highlight-ing the significance of a single moral concept in technologists discourse.In discussing the company’s strategy, the technologists we in-terviewed described CareTech as a “platform,” “communication company,” or “logistical engine,”, foregrounding CareTech’s use of digital technology to improve efficiency, and framed their work asa response to logistical challenges in the home care industry. Aiden described what he framed as the company’s main value proposition:I think the big sort of sell is, it is getting harder and harder to operate care. I think it is getting more expensive...the core value proposition is where we are trying to figure out how to build a platform around doing this, and helping agencies focus more on their relationships with their communities and customers.He elaborated that, by centralizing operations, CareTech offers partner agencies relief from work that is “consuming and grueling,whether it’s paperwork, management, documentation, staffing, lo-gistics, or being on call all the time.” By filling this role, CareTech‘frees up agencies to both source customers and maintain that rela-tionship and kind of connection’ (Aiden). Repeated references to the relationship between CareTech and the agencies with which it partners serve two purposes. First, they identify areas whereCareTech uses technology to increase efficiency in the home care industry. This problem formulation provides the background for how organizational solutions are framed. Second, they format a division of labor. In this account, partner agencies are positioned as responsible for managing relationships in local markets, while the platform oversees aspects of labor control and management.Here, technologists frame the platform’s work in industrial terms and partner agencies in domestic terms. 4.1.2 Staffing Practices as Solutions. As they justified their work,technologists also blended elements from multiple moral frame-works. Specifically, they simultaneously appealed to notions of market dominance and civic responsibility. This overlap materialized as Robert, a data scientist, stated that the company’s scale offered a ‘unified view across markets’ and provided access to a sufficient amount of data to use statistical techniques to ‘learn from the data to provide better home care’, serving as a “competitive dif-ferentiator in the market.” In addition, Floyd framed the company's size as affording more ‘careful’ staffing practice:From a systemic perspective, when you are bigger you have these systems in place, and you do not have to guilt somebody into working a shift. If you need a shift filled, you have a stable of hundreds of caregivers you can reach out to, it is just a matter of how much bonus you have to put on it.These rhetorical strategies demonstrate how technologists draw on multiple moral frameworks to present their work as solutions to different problems.Building on discussions of CareTech’s organizational strategy,technologists most concretely articulated their efforts toward ‘im-proving care in society’ through labor management. They started these discussions by problematizing caregiver job quality under legacy home care practices as associated with low wages, few ben-efits, rigid scheduling practices, and little recognition of caregivers efforts. Kennedy critiqued legacy staffing practices on the grounds of fairness and transparency:There’s a lot of favoritism that happens. There’s a lack of transparency. And so as you can imagine, the caregivers who work the most shifts, they’re able to earn the most amount of money. And that’s really helping to improve their lives and livelihoods. Other technologists framed algorithmic staffing as a solution to the legacy staffing practices that Kennedy identified as opaque and unfair. While Kennedy incorporated concerns about material well-being into her critiques, other technologists generally avoided discussing their efforts toward increasing caregiver job quality in terms of a market-based moral framework. This may have resulted from the market constraints of care, where the price for private pay home care is inaccessible for many families. Aria explainedthat raising wages for caregivers would make the price of care“unpayable” by many clients. 4.1.3 Professionalizing Care. Instead, technologists framed their efforts as attempts to improve caregivers’ status and provide them with a career. Aria noted that improving the collective status of caregivers was part of CareTech’s mission since its founding, em-phasizing challenging aspects of the job:I think that a really big piece of what CareTech is try-ing to do and has been trying to do since the beginning you know, elevate the profession of caregiving. Andtruly treat it a profession instead of just a job...because it's a difficult, emotionally intense, sometimes physi-cally intense thing to do.Floyd described further aspirations to elevate caregivers’ status through professionalization:I would say that [career] is a north star for us. I think everyone views that as an innovation that we can and should make, and the profession is worth it... we're working towards it, but we haven’t actually gotten there yet.These discussions highlight the links that technologists establish between different moral frameworks as they respond to a complex set of challenges. While they expressed concern about the value that care holds in society, increasing the pecuniary value of car was viewed as infeasible. Technologists responded to this problem by appealing to the status of the profession. However, technologists most defined solutions came in the form of staffing algorithms.4.2 Datafying CareWe unpack staffing practices at CareTech, which we argue are emblematic of technological solutionism. Our analysis reveals that technologists associated different aspects of staffing algorithms with different moral frameworks. We argue that how decisions are made about who is best suited for particular shifts—and why—is changing with the advent and implementation of algorithmic staffing tools as technologists prioritize efficiency. However, discussions with technologists show that there are tensions present in the use of algorithms. On the one hand, technologists discussed their work in terms of trying to increase caregiver performance. Performance Evaluation metrics break care into a set of constituent elements closely aligned with operational efficiency (an appeal to the indus-trial moral framework). On the other hand, technologists described their work as oriented toward establishing long-term relationships between caregivers and care recipients (an appeal to the domestic moral framework).The metrics and measurements that support algorithmic staffing practices are most closely associated with notions of productivity and operational efficiency. Technologists presented one part of their work as oriented toward increasing the “performance, or perceived performance of the caregiver” (Floyd). They described how this work is accomplished by measuring: (1) timeliness (how frequently a caregiver arrives to a shift on time); (2) consistency (adherence to schedule shifts); (3) application usage (whether or not the caregiver uses the application to clock in to and out of shifts and evaluate care recipient well-being); and (4) call-offs (shifts not released seven days in advance). While this evaluation practice makes care legible based on a discrete set of metrics, the composition of these metrics is oriented toward operational efficiency rather than the experiences of care recipients or care coordinators.Technologists contrasted their work with platforms in the ride-hailing industry7, describing how their work was motivated by the desire to establish long-term relationships between caregivers and care recipients. They referenced algorithms in terms that framed care as a holistic practice, often comparing the product of their work to other intimate relationships. Staffing algorithms have a role at two main sites: as initial schedules were made and when other caregivers called off their shifts. When caregivers are scheduled during their onboarding, staff members at CareTech use algorithmic recommendation systems to match caregivers with care recipients.In both cases, platform architects compared the matching process to other intimate relations between caregivers and care recipients.In Sandra’s words: Once the data are all collected, [the algorithm] gives us a list of caregivers, and it was ranked by most likely to be picked up by the caregiver...there is a...I don't want to say negotiating, but there are conversations that go back and forth. Because it does become an arranged marriage when you’re putting it inside thehome.In instances where shifts opened up with clients, the platform gives caregivers the option to pick up shifts with these clients through a user interface that Floyd described as “not not tinder 8 inspired. In advancing these relationship-based arguments, technologists define quality care by referencing domestic relationships between caregivers and care recipients.On the one hand, technologists seek to build a platform that effi-ciently delivers consistent care to a growing number of older adult care recipients. On the other, they describe their work as motivated by a desire to optimize relationships between caregivers and care recipients. At the same time, they framed their efforts as improving fairness, accountability, and transparency in staffing practices. Pair-ing discussions of metrics—which break care down into constituent elements associated with industrial efficiency—with algorithms staffing practices—which technologists use to frame evaluation in domestic terms—reveals that these actors associate different parts of their job with distinct moral frameworks to meet a complex set of demands. Further, interviews with caregivers and coordinators reveal that these performance evaluation criteria and platform staffing practices are a source of tension and stress.4.3 Platform AsymmetriesWhat are the consequences of technologists’ actions? To answer this question, we turn to platform caregivers’ and care coordinators’ per-spectives and experiences. Contrary to technologists’ aspirations touse algorithms to build a fairer, more transparent order, algorithmic staffing practices in fact created new conditions of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. First, we focus on evaluation practices.CareTech’s app for caregivers displays ratings across several met-rics related to operational aspects of care delivery (i.e., timeliness,consistency, application usage, and call-offs). The platform also sends weekly caregiver evaluation surveys to coordinators but does not share this feedback directly with caregivers. Further, caregivers rarely received qualitative feedback regarding the quality of care they provided. Caregivers discussed how these aspects of platform design contributed to ambiguity regarding insight into their perfor-mance, while coordinators approached completing survey-based caregiver evaluations with ambivalence. Second, we analyze care-givers’ interactions with CareTech’s staffing practices. Caregivers described experiencing collapsed boundaries between working and personal time. Despite these new challenges, the caregivers and coordinators we interviewed did not mention a desire to leave. .4.3.1 Ambiguity and Ambivalence. While caregivers described providing care as meaningful and were generally content with the conditions they faced on the platform, they discussed a lack of clarity regarding expectations and performance. As Hayden said:I believe that the clients, they also rate us after every shift. So then if we get rated lowly every time or pretty consistently, I’m sure they will reach out tous...I don’t know that it helps us rate our care and how well we’re doing with our clients, but I don't know how else they could do that...you hear stories of people who are dissatisfied with their care, and that's hard to tell.It was only after connecting with other caregivers that Hayden Learned that it was possible to request a performance evaluation form CareTech. Further, the opacity of metrics created feelings of worry for care-givers about their performance. As a new caregiver on the platform,Hazel worried about a low client consistency rating and discussed needing to take the initiative to understand why she received low ratings across other metrics. Puzzled about low application usage ratings, Hazel described needing to reach out to CareTech to understand “what [she] was missing.” CareTech’s communication and evaluation practices created unclear situations with multiple interpretations and required additional labor on the part of caregivers to understand how care recipients experienced their care and how the platform judged their performance. Coordinators, on the other hand, discussed their own evaluation practices as infused with ambivalence—a finding that we found surprising given the intimate and impactful context of care for an older loved one. While coordinators described clear feelings about the care provided to loved ones, our interviewees responded to CareTech’s evaluation surveys inconsistently. Coordinators expressed satisfaction with the care that caregivers provided and thus did not feel a need to fill out the company’s weekly care-giver evaluation survey, described how these surveys were not as useful compared to in-person evaluations performed over more extended periods, or expressed that they did not feel their feedback through these outlets was listened to by CareTech. Phyllis—who lives with her care recipient—described that since the quality of care was so consistent, there was not a need to be very detailed in her evaluations: “they will send out those [surveys] weekly...soyou click on attentiveness, preparation, and I don’t remember what they all are. There’s about five of them. I don’t get very detailed.” On The other hand, Brooks—who did not live with his care recipient,and was dissatisfied with the consistency of staffing provided byCareTech—described feeling overwhelmed by the amount of eval-uating he was asked to do: “For each one of the caregivers that has been in, they’re asking for an opinion for eight to 10 caregivers everyMonday, on the same thing, the same people doing the same thing.I’ve had a hard time seeing the value on a weekly basis.” He saw more value in evaluations carried out over longer intervals as it had been before the acquisition. There used to be the quarterly report where they would actually go in and visit and come back and say,‘this has changed, or this looks like it’s changed’...when someone steps in four or five times a year those are the ones that can pick out some things.Opal, who uses CareTech to provide care to her husband, discussed her attitude towards the surveys: “Honestly, I ignore [the surveys]. It’s not something I want to do. I don’t know why. I know they're doing great.” These perspectives demonstrate a difference in the worth actors ascribed to particular evaluation practices, high-lighting a mismatch between technologists’, coordinators’, and care-givers’ perspectives. Other coordinators described non-use of CareTech’s evaluation infrastructure, even when there were striking departures from care expectations. Coordinators justified their approach by appealing to different moral frameworks. Riley said, “what did happen onetime, and I should probably be more tuned into it...there was one day when one of the caregivers didn’t show up at all. And I didn't know about it until the next day.” She justified the non-use through appeals to a domestic moral framework: “I’m not as hands-on, I’mnot looking at the app to see what they’re doing. I get my feedback on how they’re doing from my mom and dad.” Winnie, who relied on a caregiver to transport her mother to church on Sunday mornings, described situations where sometimes a caregiver assigned to the shift couldn’t drive or had no car. Even so, she did not fill out regular surveys, drawing on her experience as a business owner (industrial)to express that she understood the challenges of staffing shifts: “it’sa very hard thing to maneuver in the world that we’re walking in. We Own a small business. We employ 13 ladies, so I understand.” At the same time, she seemed to negatively moralize non-use: “I will be honest with you that a survey has come...I haven’t filled it out. So I Haven't done due diligence on my part. You know, so I’m going to own that part.” While some coordinators expressed frustration about consistency, communication, quality, and the efficacy of evaluation practices, they appealed to multiple moral frameworks to justify different uses of evaluation infrastructure.4.3.2 Work Practices and Professional Boundaries. Continued dis-cussion with caregivers provided insight into how the problems that technologists faced contributed to aspects of platform design.The need to fill open shifts and coordinate care work across multiple individuals—associated with an industrial moral framework—took precedence over other concerns. Francine’s account of interactions with CareTech provides an example of how the need to staff shifts devalued communication about performance: “they have never given me any feedback or evaluation, the only time they call is about the schedule, asking if you can work more.” We argue that technologists prioritization of needs associated with the industrial moral frame-work eroded the boundary between caregivers’ work and personal lives and changed care practices.For example, the platform uses a notification system to bring open shifts to caregivers’ attention. However, Pepper describe how the constant notification stream makes it difficult for her to differentiate between work and leisure time:I can tell they have a lot of shifts to fill in. Am I go-ing to be under pressure? They’ve asked me for five things, and you said no to all of them, it feels likeI should say yes to something now. It’s just a little harder to be either working or not working...when you see your phone in the morning and you see all those notifications there.Hayden described receiving “30 to 40” notifications a day from the app, even after reaching out to CareTech to express that they would not work any more shifts. Further, they described confu-sion and frustration regarding the processes by which shifts were initially assigned:I actually said no to [the shift], but they scheduled me anyway. Which was how I got a lot of my shifts,which was okay...I know sometimes it sounds weird,but I would say no to a shift, maybe they’d think thatI said yes.This account suggests that the platform does not allow for as much flexibility as technologists imagine.In contrast to legacy record-keeping procedures, where care-givers left paper-based care notes in clients’ homes, CareTech’splatform requires that caregivers describe their shifts upon clock-ing out in an electronic journal that is viewable by coordinators and other caregivers. While caregivers described that the journal helped them feel more prepared for each shift, they also described reading journal entries outside of working hours, which provided further evidence for blurred boundaries between work and personal life.For example, Chauncey described reading entries “at night, before Igo to bed, I start reading if I’m going to work the next morning.” In Addition, platform architecture requiring caregivers to complete these logs changed caregivers’ relationship to time spent on the job. Francine described how filling out the notes, especially in the time-sensitive context of a shift, placed pressure on how she spent time providing care: “if you clock out right at a minute after [your shift ends] they get you on that.” Efforts to avoid disciplinary action created new relationships to time: “I just always try to clock out a few minutes before because you get all these questions before closing out the app” (Francine). In these cases, platform architecture changed caregivers' relationships with their time both on and off the clock,which put caregivers under additional pressure.We found that aspects of platform and algorithm design create new forms of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. We argue that this results from a mismatch between technologists’ moral reasoning and that of other platform actors. In addition, the need to fill open shifts and coordinate work across many individuals pri-oritizes a logic of efficiency over concerns for caregiver job quality.Despite coordinators’ unmet expectations and new pressures that the platform placed on caregivers, both sets of actors maintain a commitment to the platform. A possible explanation for contin-ued attachment is the moral significance of ‘care.’ While the term carries various meanings across actors and situations, it may act as a resource that maintains a particular status quo by mitigating organized critique of or departure from the platform.

52,Metrics,reflectsPrecept,OperationalEfficiency,"The subject of our case study, CareTech4, is one of several start-upsthat are credited with “reinventing the [home care] agency model”[22]. Prior to data collection, CareTech acquired StayHome, a traditional home care agency franchise. To contextualize our findings,we briefly discuss CareTech’s business model.CareTech partners with traditional home care agencies to support back-end administrative, legal, compliance, and logistics functions in exchange for a share of partner agencies’ revenue, employing caregivers directly. Caregivers assist with activities of daily living(i.e., bathing, dressing, getting in or out of a bed or chair, walking,using the toilet, eating) [43], and instrumental activities of daily living (i.e., cooking, cleaning, transportation, laundry, managing finances) [46]. CareTech’s use of algorithms to match caregivers to care recipients is central to our case. When we started data collection, CareTech’s technology platform had recently been im-plemented at StayHome’s company-owned agencies, providing a unique opportunity to investigate care algorithm implementation.In this paper, we focus primarily on CareTech’s staffing prac-tices. CareTech uses metrics and algorithms, along with human management, to staff shifts. Staffing algorithms have a role at two main sites: as initial schedules were made and when other care-givers called off their shifts. When caregivers are scheduled during their onboarding, staff members at CareTech use algorithmic recommendation systems to match caregivers with care recipients. Evaluation metrics (i.e., timeliness, consistency, application usage,and call-offs), along with other data (e.g., caregiver commute time,number of complaints) are used to match caregivers and care recipients. Coordinators receive weekly surveys about the quality of care provided, and provide responses on a linear scale5. After IRB approval, we recruited participants—technologists (n =14), caregivers (n = 9), and coordinators (n = 7)—through a partnership with CareTech and StayHome for interviews using convenience and purposive sampling [10]. StayHome’s research staff arranged site visit and helped recruit participants. We provided a brief description of the study and a screening questionnaire distributed amongst the caregivers and coordinators over email. This approach provided an opportunity to learn from technologists, caregivers,coordinators who were enthusiastic about sharing their experi-ences with the platform. Table 2 and table 3 provide an overview of participant profiles.(1) Technologists: Technologists consisted of software engi-neers, designers, product managers, and data and opera-tions workers. Software engineers talked about buildingCareTech’s features and the company’s history. Designers Develop CareTech’s front-end user experience for caregivers.Designers, the operations team, and a product manager described how they approached curating the caregiver experi-ence. The data scientists, data analysts, and data stewards dis-cussed the metrics used to measure caregiver performance,the data that staffing algorithms use, and how algorithms work in practice.(2) Caregivers: We use the term ‘caregivers’ to refer to the people employed by CareTech to provide care for pay.(3) Coordinators: The term ‘coordinators’ refers to people that pay for CareTech’s services and coordinate their delivery,usually on behalf of an older loved one. Recruiting interview participants through a partnership with Stay-Home and CareTech potentially biased results toward more positive perspectives of organizational practices. Caregivers and coordina-tors with more negative views about the company may have been reluctant to share their opinions or participate in interviews alto-gether due to fears of retaliation from the platform. Convenience Sampling limited the extent to which we were able to understand differences across demographic subgroups. Future work should explore this issue. Further, recruitment overlooked the perspectives of care coordinators and caregivers who have left the platform due to difficulties This study draws on data gathered from one week of observations performed in July 2022 and 30 interviews conducted between May2022 and August 2022. We conducted in-depth interviews to understand the cultural inputs that shape algorithm design and the implications for caregivers and coordinators. Interviews are well-suited for understanding social dimensions of how people interpret the world and take actions based on those interpretations [64]. Interviews with technology workers show how they make sense of their work and build systems [67], and interviews with caregivers and coordinators show that care practices diverge from organizational philosophy [53]. After several interviews, one researcher visitedStayHome’s global headquarters and a company-owned agency,located in a major Midwestern city in the U.S. The researcher toured the company’s offices and met with support staff. In addition, theresearcher engaged these actors in informal conversations to learn how StayHome and CareTech operate. To understand how the plat-form is presented to caregivers and what aspects of paid care work are emphasized, the researcher observed a caregiver training ses-sion on lifting and transferring techniques at one of StayHome’scompany-owned franchises and attended a virtual onboarding ses-sion with CareTech in the afternoon.We developed the interview guide with interest in valuation and evaluation practices as they occur on CareTech’s platform. Treating valuation as a moral outlook, we drew on practice-oriented approaches to understanding how different actors conceptualize and contribute value in labor contexts [36]. Examining the practices of the people that develop platforms and those who are subject to their architecture provides an opportunity to identify the underlying justifications and actions that shape and transform care work as it occurs on the ground. Interview questions thus sought to elicit interviewees' daily practices, what elements of their work they described as most important, the least favorite aspects of their work,and their ideological orientation towards the concept of ‘care.’After obtaining consent, we recorded the interviews, which lasted between 45 and 90 minutes and took place mainly over Zoom. However, we did interview several caregivers and one coordinator in person. Team members iteratively refined these themes through discussion and mapped them to the EoW framework. We used a third-party qualitative coding tool (NVivo) to complete the coding process. To make theoretical sense of the data, we returned to the literature and iterated between data and extant research. Our findings indicate that technologists drew on several economies of worth—which we refer to as moral frameworks—to navigate the seemingly irreconcilable demands of home care. They referenced multiple interpretations of the term ‘care’ to resolve contradictions.We illustrate this point by first focusing on how technologists described the problems that they claim to solve. Then, we analyze the nature of the solutions they presented, highlighting how technolo-gists imbued different aspects of algorithm design and function with moral meanings. This finding demonstrates the interpretive flexibil-ity of technological artifacts. Finally, we turn to the perspectives of caregivers and coordinators. Their accounts show how algorithmic staffing practices created new forms of uncertainty—the mirror of technologists' stated intentions.4.1 Navigating Contextual ComplexityTechnologists drew on multiple moral frameworks to navigate expectations and demands, appealing to various interpretations of care’ to reconcile the contradictory pressures they face.

They described how this work is accomplished by measuring: (1) timeliness (how frequently a caregiver arrives to a shift on time); (2) consistency (adherence to schedule shifts); (3) application usage (whether or not the caregiver uses the application to clock in to and out of shifts and evaluate care recipient well-being); and (4) call-offs (shifts not released seven days in advance). While this evaluation practice makes care legible based on a discrete set of metrics, the composition of these metrics is oriented toward operational efficiency rather than the experiences of care recipients or care coordinators.Technologists contrasted their work with platforms in the ride-hailing industry7, describing how their work was motivated by the desire to establish long-term relationships between caregivers and care recipients. They referenced algorithms in terms that framed care as a holistic practice, often comparing the product of their work to other intimate relationships. Staffing algorithms have a role at two main sites: as initial schedules were made and when other caregivers called off their shifts. When caregivers are scheduled during their onboarding, staff members at CareTech use algorithmic recommendation systems to match caregivers with care recipients.In both cases, platform architects compared the matching process to other intimate relations between caregivers and care recipients.In Sandra’s words: Once the data are all collected, [the algorithm] gives us a list of caregivers, and it was ranked by most likely to be picked up by the caregiver...there is a...I don't want to say negotiating, but there are conversations that go back and forth. Because it does become an arranged marriage when you’re putting it inside thehome.In instances where shifts opened up with clients, the platform gives caregivers the option to pick up shifts with these clients through a user interface that Floyd described as “not not tinder 8 inspired. In advancing these relationship-based arguments, technologists define quality care by referencing domestic relationships between caregivers and care recipients.On the one hand, technologists seek to build a platform that effi-ciently delivers consistent care to a growing number of older adult care recipients. On the other, they describe their work as motivated by a desire to optimize relationships between caregivers and care recipients. At the same time, they framed their efforts as improving fairness, accountability, and transparency in staffing practices. Pair-ing discussions of metrics—which break care down into constituent elements associated with industrial efficiency—with algorithms staffing practices—which technologists use to frame evaluation in domestic terms—reveals that these actors associate different parts of their job with distinct moral frameworks to meet a complex set of demands. Further, interviews with caregivers and coordinators reveal that these performance evaluation criteria and platform staffing practices are a source of tension and stress.4.3 Platform AsymmetriesWhat are the consequences of technologists’ actions? To answer this question, we turn to platform caregivers’ and care coordinators’ per-spectives and experiences. Contrary to technologists’ aspirations touse algorithms to build a fairer, more transparent order, algorithmic staffing practices in fact created new conditions of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. First, we focus on evaluation practices.CareTech’s app for caregivers displays ratings across several met-rics related to operational aspects of care delivery (i.e., timeliness,consistency, application usage, and call-offs). The platform also sends weekly caregiver evaluation surveys to coordinators but does not share this feedback directly with caregivers. Further, caregivers rarely received qualitative feedback regarding the quality of care they provided. Caregivers discussed how these aspects of platform design contributed to ambiguity regarding insight into their perfor-mance, while coordinators approached completing survey-based caregiver evaluations with ambivalence. Second, we analyze care-givers’ interactions with CareTech’s staffing practices. Caregivers described experiencing collapsed boundaries between working and personal time. Despite these new challenges, the caregivers and coordinators we interviewed did not mention a desire to leave. .4.3.1 Ambiguity and Ambivalence. While caregivers described providing care as meaningful and were generally content with the conditions they faced on the platform, they discussed a lack of clarity regarding expectations and performance. As Hayden said:I believe that the clients, they also rate us after every shift. So then if we get rated lowly every time or pretty consistently, I’m sure they will reach out tous...I don’t know that it helps us rate our care and how well we’re doing with our clients, but I don't know how else they could do that...you hear stories of people who are dissatisfied with their care, and that's hard to tell.It was only after connecting with other caregivers that Hayden Learned that it was possible to request a performance evaluation form CareTech. Further, the opacity of metrics created feelings of worry for care-givers about their performance. As a new caregiver on the platform,Hazel worried about a low client consistency rating and discussed needing to take the initiative to understand why she received low ratings across other metrics. Puzzled about low application usage ratings, Hazel described needing to reach out to CareTech to understand “what [she] was missing.” CareTech’s communication and evaluation practices created unclear situations with multiple interpretations and required additional labor on the part of caregivers to understand how care recipients experienced their care and how the platform judged their performance. Coordinators, on the other hand, discussed their own evaluation practices as infused with ambivalence—a finding that we found surprising given the intimate and impactful context of care for an older loved one. While coordinators described clear feelings about the care provided to loved ones, our interviewees responded to CareTech’s evaluation surveys inconsistently. Coordinators expressed satisfaction with the care that caregivers provided and thus did not feel a need to fill out the company’s weekly care-giver evaluation survey, described how these surveys were not as useful compared to in-person evaluations performed over more extended periods, or expressed that they did not feel their feedback through these outlets was listened to by CareTech. Phyllis—who lives with her care recipient—described that since the quality of care was so consistent, there was not a need to be very detailed in her evaluations: “they will send out those [surveys] weekly...soyou click on attentiveness, preparation, and I don’t remember what they all are. There’s about five of them. I don’t get very detailed.” On The other hand, Brooks—who did not live with his care recipient,and was dissatisfied with the consistency of staffing provided byCareTech—described feeling overwhelmed by the amount of eval-uating he was asked to do: “For each one of the caregivers that has been in, they’re asking for an opinion for eight to 10 caregivers everyMonday, on the same thing, the same people doing the same thing.I’ve had a hard time seeing the value on a weekly basis.” He saw more value in evaluations carried out over longer intervals as it had been before the acquisition. There used to be the quarterly report where they would actually go in and visit and come back and say,‘this has changed, or this looks like it’s changed’...when someone steps in four or five times a year those are the ones that can pick out some things.Opal, who uses CareTech to provide care to her husband, discussed her attitude towards the surveys: “Honestly, I ignore [the surveys]. It’s not something I want to do. I don’t know why. I know they're doing great.” These perspectives demonstrate a difference in the worth actors ascribed to particular evaluation practices, high-lighting a mismatch between technologists’, coordinators’, and care-givers’ perspectives. Other coordinators described non-use of CareTech’s evaluation infrastructure, even when there were striking departures from care expectations. Coordinators justified their approach by appealing to different moral frameworks. Riley said, “what did happen onetime, and I should probably be more tuned into it...there was one day when one of the caregivers didn’t show up at all. And I didn't know about it until the next day.” She justified the non-use through appeals to a domestic moral framework: “I’m not as hands-on, I’mnot looking at the app to see what they’re doing. I get my feedback on how they’re doing from my mom and dad.” Winnie, who relied on a caregiver to transport her mother to church on Sunday mornings, described situations where sometimes a caregiver assigned to the shift couldn’t drive or had no car. Even so, she did not fill out regular surveys, drawing on her experience as a business owner (industrial)to express that she understood the challenges of staffing shifts: “it’sa very hard thing to maneuver in the world that we’re walking in. We Own a small business. We employ 13 ladies, so I understand.” At the same time, she seemed to negatively moralize non-use: “I will be honest with you that a survey has come...I haven’t filled it out. So I Haven't done due diligence on my part. You know, so I’m going to own that part.” While some coordinators expressed frustration about consistency, communication, quality, and the efficacy of evaluation practices, they appealed to multiple moral frameworks to justify different uses of evaluation infrastructure.4.3.2 Work Practices and Professional Boundaries. Continued dis-cussion with caregivers provided insight into how the problems that technologists faced contributed to aspects of platform design.The need to fill open shifts and coordinate care work across multiple individuals—associated with an industrial moral framework—took precedence over other concerns. Francine’s account of interactions with CareTech provides an example of how the need to staff shifts devalued communication about performance: “they have never given me any feedback or evaluation, the only time they call is about the schedule, asking if you can work more.” We argue that technologists prioritization of needs associated with the industrial moral frame-work eroded the boundary between caregivers’ work and personal lives and changed care practices.For example, the platform uses a notification system to bring open shifts to caregivers’ attention. However, Pepper describe how the constant notification stream makes it difficult for her to differentiate between work and leisure time:I can tell they have a lot of shifts to fill in. Am I go-ing to be under pressure? They’ve asked me for five things, and you said no to all of them, it feels likeI should say yes to something now. It’s just a little harder to be either working or not working...when you see your phone in the morning and you see all those notifications there.Hayden described receiving “30 to 40” notifications a day from the app, even after reaching out to CareTech to express that they would not work any more shifts. Further, they described confu-sion and frustration regarding the processes by which shifts were initially assigned:I actually said no to [the shift], but they scheduled me anyway. Which was how I got a lot of my shifts,which was okay...I know sometimes it sounds weird,but I would say no to a shift, maybe they’d think thatI said yes.This account suggests that the platform does not allow for as much flexibility as technologists imagine.In contrast to legacy record-keeping procedures, where care-givers left paper-based care notes in clients’ homes, CareTech’splatform requires that caregivers describe their shifts upon clock-ing out in an electronic journal that is viewable by coordinators and other caregivers. While caregivers described that the journal helped them feel more prepared for each shift, they also described reading journal entries outside of working hours, which provided further evidence for blurred boundaries between work and personal life.For example, Chauncey described reading entries “at night, before Igo to bed, I start reading if I’m going to work the next morning.” In Addition, platform architecture requiring caregivers to complete these logs changed caregivers’ relationship to time spent on the job. Francine described how filling out the notes, especially in the time-sensitive context of a shift, placed pressure on how she spent time providing care: “if you clock out right at a minute after [your shift ends] they get you on that.” Efforts to avoid disciplinary action created new relationships to time: “I just always try to clock out a few minutes before because you get all these questions before closing out the app” (Francine). In these cases, platform architecture changed caregivers' relationships with their time both on and off the clock,which put caregivers under additional pressure.We found that aspects of platform and algorithm design create new forms of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. We argue that this results from a mismatch between technologists’ moral reasoning and that of other platform actors. In addition, the need to fill open shifts and coordinate work across many individuals pri-oritizes a logic of efficiency over concerns for caregiver job quality.Despite coordinators’ unmet expectations and new pressures that the platform placed on caregivers, both sets of actors maintain a commitment to the platform. A possible explanation for contin-ued attachment is the moral significance of ‘care.’ While the term carries various meanings across actors and situations, it may act as a resource that maintains a particular status quo by mitigating organized critique of or departure from the platform. ","629-30, 631-4",the composition of these metrics is oriented toward operational efficiency rather than the experiences of care recipients or care coordinators.
53,PlatformDesign,constrainsAgent,Caregivers,"The subject of our case study, CareTech4, is one of several start-upsthat are credited with “reinventing the [home care] agency model”[22]. Prior to data collection, CareTech acquired StayHome, a traditional home care agency franchise. To contextualize our findings,we briefly discuss CareTech’s business model.CareTech partners with traditional home care agencies to support back-end administrative, legal, compliance, and logistics functions in exchange for a share of partner agencies’ revenue, employing caregivers directly. Caregivers assist with activities of daily living(i.e., bathing, dressing, getting in or out of a bed or chair, walking,using the toilet, eating) [43], and instrumental activities of daily living (i.e., cooking, cleaning, transportation, laundry, managing finances) [46]. CareTech’s use of algorithms to match caregivers to care recipients is central to our case. When we started data collection, CareTech’s technology platform had recently been im-plemented at StayHome’s company-owned agencies, providing a unique opportunity to investigate care algorithm implementation.In this paper, we focus primarily on CareTech’s staffing prac-tices. CareTech uses metrics and algorithms, along with human management, to staff shifts. Staffing algorithms have a role at two main sites: as initial schedules were made and when other care-givers called off their shifts. When caregivers are scheduled during their onboarding, staff members at CareTech use algorithmic recommendation systems to match caregivers with care recipients. Evaluation metrics (i.e., timeliness, consistency, application usage,and call-offs), along with other data (e.g., caregiver commute time,number of complaints) are used to match caregivers and care recipients. Coordinators receive weekly surveys about the quality of care provided, and provide responses on a linear scale5. After IRB approval, we recruited participants—technologists (n =14), caregivers (n = 9), and coordinators (n = 7)—through a partnership with CareTech and StayHome for interviews using convenience and purposive sampling [10]. StayHome’s research staff arranged site visit and helped recruit participants. We provided a brief description of the study and a screening questionnaire distributed amongst the caregivers and coordinators over email. This approach provided an opportunity to learn from technologists, caregivers,coordinators who were enthusiastic about sharing their experi-ences with the platform. Table 2 and table 3 provide an overview of participant profiles.(1) Technologists: Technologists consisted of software engi-neers, designers, product managers, and data and opera-tions workers. Software engineers talked about buildingCareTech’s features and the company’s history. Designers Develop CareTech’s front-end user experience for caregivers.Designers, the operations team, and a product manager described how they approached curating the caregiver experi-ence. The data scientists, data analysts, and data stewards dis-cussed the metrics used to measure caregiver performance,the data that staffing algorithms use, and how algorithms work in practice.(2) Caregivers: We use the term ‘caregivers’ to refer to the people employed by CareTech to provide care for pay.(3) Coordinators: The term ‘coordinators’ refers to people that pay for CareTech’s services and coordinate their delivery,usually on behalf of an older loved one. Recruiting interview participants through a partnership with Stay-Home and CareTech potentially biased results toward more positive perspectives of organizational practices. Caregivers and coordina-tors with more negative views about the company may have been reluctant to share their opinions or participate in interviews alto-gether due to fears of retaliation from the platform. Convenience Sampling limited the extent to which we were able to understand differences across demographic subgroups. Future work should explore this issue. Further, recruitment overlooked the perspectives of care coordinators and caregivers who have left the platform due to difficulties This study draws on data gathered from one week of observations performed in July 2022 and 30 interviews conducted between May2022 and August 2022. We conducted in-depth interviews to understand the cultural inputs that shape algorithm design and the implications for caregivers and coordinators. Interviews are well-suited for understanding social dimensions of how people interpret the world and take actions based on those interpretations [64]. Interviews with technology workers show how they make sense of their work and build systems [67], and interviews with caregivers and coordinators show that care practices diverge from organizational philosophy [53]. After several interviews, one researcher visitedStayHome’s global headquarters and a company-owned agency,located in a major Midwestern city in the U.S. The researcher toured the company’s offices and met with support staff. In addition, theresearcher engaged these actors in informal conversations to learn how StayHome and CareTech operate. To understand how the plat-form is presented to caregivers and what aspects of paid care work are emphasized, the researcher observed a caregiver training ses-sion on lifting and transferring techniques at one of StayHome’scompany-owned franchises and attended a virtual onboarding ses-sion with CareTech in the afternoon.We developed the interview guide with interest in valuation and evaluation practices as they occur on CareTech’s platform. Treating valuation as a moral outlook, we drew on practice-oriented approaches to understanding how different actors conceptualize and contribute value in labor contexts [36]. Examining the practices of the people that develop platforms and those who are subject to their architecture provides an opportunity to identify the underlying justifications and actions that shape and transform care work as it occurs on the ground. Interview questions thus sought to elicit interviewees' daily practices, what elements of their work they described as most important, the least favorite aspects of their work,and their ideological orientation towards the concept of ‘care.’After obtaining consent, we recorded the interviews, which lasted between 45 and 90 minutes and took place mainly over Zoom. However, we did interview several caregivers and one coordinator in person. Team members iteratively refined these themes through discussion and mapped them to the EoW framework. We used a third-party qualitative coding tool (NVivo) to complete the coding process. To make theoretical sense of the data, we returned to the literature and iterated between data and extant research. Our findings indicate that technologists drew on several economies of worth—which we refer to as moral frameworks—to navigate the seemingly irreconcilable demands of home care. They referenced multiple interpretations of the term ‘care’ to resolve contradictions.We illustrate this point by first focusing on how technologists described the problems that they claim to solve. Then, we analyze the nature of the solutions they presented, highlighting how technolo-gists imbued different aspects of algorithm design and function with moral meanings. This finding demonstrates the interpretive flexibil-ity of technological artifacts. Finally, we turn to the perspectives of caregivers and coordinators. Their accounts show how algorithmic staffing practices created new forms of uncertainty—the mirror of technologists' stated intentions.4.1 Navigating Contextual ComplexityTechnologists drew on multiple moral frameworks to navigate expectations and demands, appealing to various interpretations of care’ to reconcile the contradictory pressures they face. The technologists we interviewed framed CareTech as a platform developed to address traditional home care agencies’ logistical and opera-tional challenges. In this context, they appealed to an industrial moral framework, framing their work as introducing greater levels of efficiency and rationalization to the home care industry. How-ever, many of the technologists we interviewed also framed their work in terms of a civic moral framework, critiquing prior staffing practices as subjective, opaque, unfair, and harmful to the material well-being of caregivers. Although these two narratives may appear contradictory, technologists unified these demands by appealing to the societal need for more care. For example, improvements inefficiency were discussed in terms of increasing the affordability of care while improving working conditions was imagined as growing the size of the caregiving workforce. We argue that technologists navigate complexity when creating and developing care algorithms by strategically appealing to justifications corresponding to differ-ent moral frameworks, drawing on multiple interpretations of a single term to move between them. Throughout this section, we draw attention to how technologists position algorithmic staffing practices as one solution to the problems they described.4.1.1 Platform Description & Motivations. The rhetoric that tech-nologists and company executives used to describe their motivation for building the platform appealed to domestic and social goods. In press releases and on the company website, CareTech’s execu-tives described their frustrations in searching for care for their own parents. Similarly, technologists invoked ideas of familial respon-sibility, relaying stories about their difficulties in finding care for aging parents. Technologists also drew on more civic-oriented no-tions of good, framing their work with reference to positive social change. For example, Richard described, “being part of something that can have a positive impact on society.” The company’s mission statement, was described as ‘improving care in society6, highlight-ing the significance of a single moral concept in technologists discourse.In discussing the company’s strategy, the technologists we in-terviewed described CareTech as a “platform,” “communication company,” or “logistical engine,”, foregrounding CareTech’s use of digital technology to improve efficiency, and framed their work asa response to logistical challenges in the home care industry. Aiden described what he framed as the company’s main value proposition:I think the big sort of sell is, it is getting harder and harder to operate care. I think it is getting more expensive...the core value proposition is where we are trying to figure out how to build a platform around doing this, and helping agencies focus more on their relationships with their communities and customers.He elaborated that, by centralizing operations, CareTech offers partner agencies relief from work that is “consuming and grueling,whether it’s paperwork, management, documentation, staffing, lo-gistics, or being on call all the time.” By filling this role, CareTech‘frees up agencies to both source customers and maintain that rela-tionship and kind of connection’ (Aiden). Repeated references to the relationship between CareTech and the agencies with which it partners serve two purposes. First, they identify areas whereCareTech uses technology to increase efficiency in the home care industry. This problem formulation provides the background for how organizational solutions are framed. Second, they format a division of labor. In this account, partner agencies are positioned as responsible for managing relationships in local markets, while the platform oversees aspects of labor control and management.Here, technologists frame the platform’s work in industrial terms and partner agencies in domestic terms. 4.1.2 Staffing Practices as Solutions. As they justified their work,technologists also blended elements from multiple moral frame-works. Specifically, they simultaneously appealed to notions of market dominance and civic responsibility. This overlap materialized as Robert, a data scientist, stated that the company’s scale offered a ‘unified view across markets’ and provided access to a sufficient amount of data to use statistical techniques to ‘learn from the data to provide better home care’, serving as a “competitive dif-ferentiator in the market.” In addition, Floyd framed the company's size as affording more ‘careful’ staffing practice:From a systemic perspective, when you are bigger you have these systems in place, and you do not have to guilt somebody into working a shift. If you need a shift filled, you have a stable of hundreds of caregivers you can reach out to, it is just a matter of how much bonus you have to put on it.These rhetorical strategies demonstrate how technologists draw on multiple moral frameworks to present their work as solutions to different problems.Building on discussions of CareTech’s organizational strategy,technologists most concretely articulated their efforts toward ‘im-proving care in society’ through labor management. They started these discussions by problematizing caregiver job quality under legacy home care practices as associated with low wages, few ben-efits, rigid scheduling practices, and little recognition of caregivers efforts. Kennedy critiqued legacy staffing practices on the grounds of fairness and transparency:There’s a lot of favoritism that happens. There’s a lack of transparency. And so as you can imagine, the caregivers who work the most shifts, they’re able to earn the most amount of money. And that’s really helping to improve their lives and livelihoods. Other technologists framed algorithmic staffing as a solution to the legacy staffing practices that Kennedy identified as opaque and unfair. While Kennedy incorporated concerns about material well-being into her critiques, other technologists generally avoided discussing their efforts toward increasing caregiver job quality in terms of a market-based moral framework. This may have resulted from the market constraints of care, where the price for private pay home care is inaccessible for many families. Aria explainedthat raising wages for caregivers would make the price of care“unpayable” by many clients. 4.1.3 Professionalizing Care. Instead, technologists framed their efforts as attempts to improve caregivers’ status and provide them with a career. Aria noted that improving the collective status of caregivers was part of CareTech’s mission since its founding, em-phasizing challenging aspects of the job:I think that a really big piece of what CareTech is try-ing to do and has been trying to do since the beginning you know, elevate the profession of caregiving. Andtruly treat it a profession instead of just a job...because it's a difficult, emotionally intense, sometimes physi-cally intense thing to do.Floyd described further aspirations to elevate caregivers’ status through professionalization:I would say that [career] is a north star for us. I think everyone views that as an innovation that we can and should make, and the profession is worth it... we're working towards it, but we haven’t actually gotten there yet.These discussions highlight the links that technologists establish between different moral frameworks as they respond to a complex set of challenges. While they expressed concern about the value that care holds in society, increasing the pecuniary value of car was viewed as infeasible. Technologists responded to this problem by appealing to the status of the profession. However, technologists most defined solutions came in the form of staffing algorithms.4.2 Datafying CareWe unpack staffing practices at CareTech, which we argue are emblematic of technological solutionism. Our analysis reveals that technologists associated different aspects of staffing algorithms with different moral frameworks. We argue that how decisions are made about who is best suited for particular shifts—and why—is changing with the advent and implementation of algorithmic staffing tools as technologists prioritize efficiency. However, discussions with technologists show that there are tensions present in the use of algorithms. On the one hand, technologists discussed their work in terms of trying to increase caregiver performance. Performance Evaluation metrics break care into a set of constituent elements closely aligned with operational efficiency (an appeal to the indus-trial moral framework). On the other hand, technologists described their work as oriented toward establishing long-term relationships between caregivers and care recipients (an appeal to the domestic moral framework).The metrics and measurements that support algorithmic staffing practices are most closely associated with notions of productivity and operational efficiency. Technologists presented one part of their work as oriented toward increasing the “performance, or perceived performance of the caregiver” (Floyd). They described how this work is accomplished by measuring: (1) timeliness (how frequently a caregiver arrives to a shift on time); (2) consistency (adherence to schedule shifts); (3) application usage (whether or not the caregiver uses the application to clock in to and out of shifts and evaluate care recipient well-being); and (4) call-offs (shifts not released seven days in advance). While this evaluation practice makes care legible based on a discrete set of metrics, the composition of these metrics is oriented toward operational efficiency rather than the experiences of care recipients or care coordinators.Technologists contrasted their work with platforms in the ride-hailing industry7, describing how their work was motivated by the desire to establish long-term relationships between caregivers and care recipients. They referenced algorithms in terms that framed care as a holistic practice, often comparing the product of their work to other intimate relationships. Staffing algorithms have a role at two main sites: as initial schedules were made and when other caregivers called off their shifts. When caregivers are scheduled during their onboarding, staff members at CareTech use algorithmic recommendation systems to match caregivers with care recipients.In both cases, platform architects compared the matching process to other intimate relations between caregivers and care recipients.In Sandra’s words: Once the data are all collected, [the algorithm] gives us a list of caregivers, and it was ranked by most likely to be picked up by the caregiver...there is a...I don't want to say negotiating, but there are conversations that go back and forth. Because it does become an arranged marriage when you’re putting it inside thehome.In instances where shifts opened up with clients, the platform gives caregivers the option to pick up shifts with these clients through a user interface that Floyd described as “not not tinder 8 inspired. In advancing these relationship-based arguments, technologists define quality care by referencing domestic relationships between caregivers and care recipients.On the one hand, technologists seek to build a platform that effi-ciently delivers consistent care to a growing number of older adult care recipients. On the other, they describe their work as motivated by a desire to optimize relationships between caregivers and care recipients. At the same time, they framed their efforts as improving fairness, accountability, and transparency in staffing practices. Pair-ing discussions of metrics—which break care down into constituent elements associated with industrial efficiency—with algorithms staffing practices—which technologists use to frame evaluation in domestic terms—reveals that these actors associate different parts of their job with distinct moral frameworks to meet a complex set of demands. Further, interviews with caregivers and coordinators reveal that these performance evaluation criteria and platform staffing practices are a source of tension and stress.4.3 Platform AsymmetriesWhat are the consequences of technologists’ actions? To answer this question, we turn to platform caregivers’ and care coordinators’ per-spectives and experiences. Contrary to technologists’ aspirations touse algorithms to build a fairer, more transparent order, algorithmic staffing practices in fact created new conditions of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. First, we focus on evaluation practices.CareTech’s app for caregivers displays ratings across several met-rics related to operational aspects of care delivery (i.e., timeliness,consistency, application usage, and call-offs). The platform also sends weekly caregiver evaluation surveys to coordinators but does not share this feedback directly with caregivers. Further, caregivers rarely received qualitative feedback regarding the quality of care they provided. Caregivers discussed how these aspects of platform design contributed to ambiguity regarding insight into their perfor-mance, while coordinators approached completing survey-based caregiver evaluations with ambivalence. Second, we analyze care-givers’ interactions with CareTech’s staffing practices. Caregivers described experiencing collapsed boundaries between working and personal time.

So I Haven't done due diligence on my part. You know, so I’m going to own that part.” While some coordinators expressed frustration about consistency, communication, quality, and the efficacy of evaluation practices, they appealed to multiple moral frameworks to justify different uses of evaluation infrastructure.4.3.2 Work Practices and Professional Boundaries. Continued dis-cussion with caregivers provided insight into how the problems that technologists faced contributed to aspects of platform design.The need to fill open shifts and coordinate care work across multiple individuals—associated with an industrial moral framework—took precedence over other concerns. Francine’s account of interactions with CareTech provides an example of how the need to staff shifts devalued communication about performance: “they have never given me any feedback or evaluation, the only time they call is about the schedule, asking if you can work more.” We argue that technologists prioritization of needs associated with the industrial moral frame-work eroded the boundary between caregivers’ work and personal lives and changed care practices.For example, the platform uses a notification system to bring open shifts to caregivers’ attention. However, Pepper describe how the constant notification stream makes it difficult for her to differentiate between work and leisure time:I can tell they have a lot of shifts to fill in. Am I go-ing to be under pressure? They’ve asked me for five things, and you said no to all of them, it feels likeI should say yes to something now. It’s just a little harder to be either working or not working...when you see your phone in the morning and you see all those notifications there.Hayden described receiving “30 to 40” notifications a day from the app, even after reaching out to CareTech to express that they would not work any more shifts. Further, they described confu-sion and frustration regarding the processes by which shifts were initially assigned:I actually said no to [the shift], but they scheduled me anyway. Which was how I got a lot of my shifts,which was okay...I know sometimes it sounds weird,but I would say no to a shift, maybe they’d think thatI said yes.This account suggests that the platform does not allow for as much flexibility as technologists imagine.In contrast to legacy record-keeping procedures, where care-givers left paper-based care notes in clients’ homes, CareTech’splatform requires that caregivers describe their shifts upon clock-ing out in an electronic journal that is viewable by coordinators and other caregivers. While caregivers described that the journal helped them feel more prepared for each shift, they also described reading journal entries outside of working hours, which provided further evidence for blurred boundaries between work and personal life.For example, Chauncey described reading entries “at night, before Igo to bed, I start reading if I’m going to work the next morning.” In Addition, platform architecture requiring caregivers to complete these logs changed caregivers’ relationship to time spent on the job. Francine described how filling out the notes, especially in the time-sensitive context of a shift, placed pressure on how she spent time providing care: “if you clock out right at a minute after [your shift ends] they get you on that.” Efforts to avoid disciplinary action created new relationships to time: “I just always try to clock out a few minutes before because you get all these questions before closing out the app” (Francine). In these cases, platform architecture changed caregivers' relationships with their time both on and off the clock,which put caregivers under additional pressure.We found that aspects of platform and algorithm design create new forms of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators.

54,Ambivalence,constrainsAgent,Coordinators,"The subject of our case study, CareTech4, is one of several start-upsthat are credited with “reinventing the [home care] agency model”[22]. Prior to data collection, CareTech acquired StayHome, a traditional home care agency franchise. To contextualize our findings,we briefly discuss CareTech’s business model.CareTech partners with traditional home care agencies to support back-end administrative, legal, compliance, and logistics functions in exchange for a share of partner agencies’ revenue, employing caregivers directly. Caregivers assist with activities of daily living(i.e., bathing, dressing, getting in or out of a bed or chair, walking,using the toilet, eating) [43], and instrumental activities of daily living (i.e., cooking, cleaning, transportation, laundry, managing finances) [46]. CareTech’s use of algorithms to match caregivers to care recipients is central to our case. When we started data collection, CareTech’s technology platform had recently been im-plemented at StayHome’s company-owned agencies, providing a unique opportunity to investigate care algorithm implementation.In this paper, we focus primarily on CareTech’s staffing prac-tices. CareTech uses metrics and algorithms, along with human management, to staff shifts. Staffing algorithms have a role at two main sites: as initial schedules were made and when other care-givers called off their shifts. When caregivers are scheduled during their onboarding, staff members at CareTech use algorithmic recommendation systems to match caregivers with care recipients. Evaluation metrics (i.e., timeliness, consistency, application usage,and call-offs), along with other data (e.g., caregiver commute time,number of complaints) are used to match caregivers and care recipients. Coordinators receive weekly surveys about the quality of care provided, and provide responses on a linear scale5. After IRB approval, we recruited participants—technologists (n =14), caregivers (n = 9), and coordinators (n = 7)—through a partnership with CareTech and StayHome for interviews using convenience and purposive sampling [10]. StayHome’s research staff arranged site visit and helped recruit participants. We provided a brief description of the study and a screening questionnaire distributed amongst the caregivers and coordinators over email. This approach provided an opportunity to learn from technologists, caregivers,coordinators who were enthusiastic about sharing their experi-ences with the platform.

Convenience Sampling limited the extent to which we were able to understand differences across demographic subgroups. Future work should explore this issue. Further, recruitment overlooked the perspectives of care coordinators and caregivers who have left the platform due to difficulties This study draws on data gathered from one week of observations performed in July 2022 and 30 interviews conducted between May2022 and August 2022. We conducted in-depth interviews to understand the cultural inputs that shape algorithm design and the implications for caregivers and coordinators. Interviews are well-suited for understanding social dimensions of how people interpret the world and take actions based on those interpretations [64]. Interviews with technology workers show how they make sense of their work and build systems [67], and interviews with caregivers and coordinators show that care practices diverge from organizational philosophy [53]. After several interviews, one researcher visitedStayHome’s global headquarters and a company-owned agency,located in a major Midwestern city in the U.S. The researcher toured the company’s offices and met with support staff. In addition, theresearcher engaged these actors in informal conversations to learn how StayHome and CareTech operate. To understand how the plat-form is presented to caregivers and what aspects of paid care work are emphasized, the researcher observed a caregiver training ses-sion on lifting and transferring techniques at one of StayHome’scompany-owned franchises and attended a virtual onboarding ses-sion with CareTech in the afternoon.We developed the interview guide with interest in valuation and evaluation practices as they occur on CareTech’s platform. Treating valuation as a moral outlook, we drew on practice-oriented approaches to understanding how different actors conceptualize and contribute value in labor contexts [36]. Examining the practices of the people that develop platforms and those who are subject to their architecture provides an opportunity to identify the underlying justifications and actions that shape and transform care work as it occurs on the ground. Interview questions thus sought to elicit interviewees' daily practices, what elements of their work they described as most important, the least favorite aspects of their work,and their ideological orientation towards the concept of ‘care.’After obtaining consent, we recorded the interviews, which lasted between 45 and 90 minutes and took place mainly over Zoom. However, we did interview several caregivers and one coordinator in person. Team members iteratively refined these themes through discussion and mapped them to the EoW framework. We used a third-party qualitative coding tool (NVivo) to complete the coding process. To make theoretical sense of the data, we returned to the literature and iterated between data and extant research. Our findings indicate that technologists drew on several economies of worth—which we refer to as moral frameworks—to navigate the seemingly irreconcilable demands of home care. They referenced multiple interpretations of the term ‘care’ to resolve contradictions.We illustrate this point by first focusing on how technologists described the problems that they claim to solve. Then, we analyze the nature of the solutions they presented, highlighting how technolo-gists imbued different aspects of algorithm design and function with moral meanings. This finding demonstrates the interpretive flexibil-ity of technological artifacts. Finally, we turn to the perspectives of caregivers and coordinators. Their accounts show how algorithmic staffing practices created new forms of uncertainty—the mirror of technologists' stated intentions.4.1 Navigating Contextual ComplexityTechnologists drew on multiple moral frameworks to navigate expectations and demands, appealing to various interpretations of care’ to reconcile the contradictory pressures they face. The technologists we interviewed framed CareTech as a platform developed to address traditional home care agencies’ logistical and opera-tional challenges. In this context, they appealed to an industrial moral framework, framing their work as introducing greater levels of efficiency and rationalization to the home care industry. How-ever, many of the technologists we interviewed also framed their work in terms of a civic moral framework, critiquing prior staffing practices as subjective, opaque, unfair, and harmful to the material well-being of caregivers. Although these two narratives may appear contradictory, technologists unified these demands by appealing to the societal need for more care. For example, improvements inefficiency were discussed in terms of increasing the affordability of care while improving working conditions was imagined as growing the size of the caregiving workforce. We argue that technologists navigate complexity when creating and developing care algorithms by strategically appealing to justifications corresponding to differ-ent moral frameworks, drawing on multiple interpretations of a single term to move between them. Throughout this section, we draw attention to how technologists position algorithmic staffing practices as one solution to the problems they described.4.1.1 Platform Description & Motivations. The rhetoric that tech-nologists and company executives used to describe their motivation for building the platform appealed to domestic and social goods. In press releases and on the company website, CareTech’s execu-tives described their frustrations in searching for care for their own parents. Similarly, technologists invoked ideas of familial respon-sibility, relaying stories about their difficulties in finding care for aging parents. Technologists also drew on more civic-oriented no-tions of good, framing their work with reference to positive social change. For example, Richard described, “being part of something that can have a positive impact on society.” The company’s mission statement, was described as ‘improving care in society6, highlight-ing the significance of a single moral concept in technologists discourse.In discussing the company’s strategy, the technologists we in-terviewed described CareTech as a “platform,” “communication company,” or “logistical engine,”, foregrounding CareTech’s use of digital technology to improve efficiency, and framed their work asa response to logistical challenges in the home care industry. Aiden described what he framed as the company’s main value proposition:I think the big sort of sell is, it is getting harder and harder to operate care. I think it is getting more expensive...the core value proposition is where we are trying to figure out how to build a platform around doing this, and helping agencies focus more on their relationships with their communities and customers.He elaborated that, by centralizing operations, CareTech offers partner agencies relief from work that is “consuming and grueling,whether it’s paperwork, management, documentation, staffing, lo-gistics, or being on call all the time.” By filling this role, CareTech‘frees up agencies to both source customers and maintain that rela-tionship and kind of connection’ (Aiden). Repeated references to the relationship between CareTech and the agencies with which it partners serve two purposes. First, they identify areas whereCareTech uses technology to increase efficiency in the home care industry. This problem formulation provides the background for how organizational solutions are framed. Second, they format a division of labor. In this account, partner agencies are positioned as responsible for managing relationships in local markets, while the platform oversees aspects of labor control and management.Here, technologists frame the platform’s work in industrial terms and partner agencies in domestic terms. 4.1.2 Staffing Practices as Solutions. As they justified their work,technologists also blended elements from multiple moral frame-works. Specifically, they simultaneously appealed to notions of market dominance and civic responsibility. This overlap materialized as Robert, a data scientist, stated that the company’s scale offered a ‘unified view across markets’ and provided access to a sufficient amount of data to use statistical techniques to ‘learn from the data to provide better home care’, serving as a “competitive dif-ferentiator in the market.” In addition, Floyd framed the company's size as affording more ‘careful’ staffing practice:From a systemic perspective, when you are bigger you have these systems in place, and you do not have to guilt somebody into working a shift. If you need a shift filled, you have a stable of hundreds of caregivers you can reach out to, it is just a matter of how much bonus you have to put on it.These rhetorical strategies demonstrate how technologists draw on multiple moral frameworks to present their work as solutions to different problems.Building on discussions of CareTech’s organizational strategy,technologists most concretely articulated their efforts toward ‘im-proving care in society’ through labor management. They started these discussions by problematizing caregiver job quality under legacy home care practices as associated with low wages, few ben-efits, rigid scheduling practices, and little recognition of caregivers efforts. Kennedy critiqued legacy staffing practices on the grounds of fairness and transparency:There’s a lot of favoritism that happens. There’s a lack of transparency. And so as you can imagine, the caregivers who work the most shifts, they’re able to earn the most amount of money. And that’s really helping to improve their lives and livelihoods. Other technologists framed algorithmic staffing as a solution to the legacy staffing practices that Kennedy identified as opaque and unfair. While Kennedy incorporated concerns about material well-being into her critiques, other technologists generally avoided discussing their efforts toward increasing caregiver job quality in terms of a market-based moral framework. This may have resulted from the market constraints of care, where the price for private pay home care is inaccessible for many families. Aria explainedthat raising wages for caregivers would make the price of care“unpayable” by many clients. 4.1.3 Professionalizing Care. Instead, technologists framed their efforts as attempts to improve caregivers’ status and provide them with a career. Aria noted that improving the collective status of caregivers was part of CareTech’s mission since its founding, em-phasizing challenging aspects of the job:I think that a really big piece of what CareTech is try-ing to do and has been trying to do since the beginning you know, elevate the profession of caregiving. Andtruly treat it a profession instead of just a job...because it's a difficult, emotionally intense, sometimes physi-cally intense thing to do.Floyd described further aspirations to elevate caregivers’ status through professionalization:I would say that [career] is a north star for us. I think everyone views that as an innovation that we can and should make, and the profession is worth it... we're working towards it, but we haven’t actually gotten there yet.These discussions highlight the links that technologists establish between different moral frameworks as they respond to a complex set of challenges. While they expressed concern about the value that care holds in society, increasing the pecuniary value of car was viewed as infeasible. Technologists responded to this problem by appealing to the status of the profession. However, technologists most defined solutions came in the form of staffing algorithms.4.2 Datafying CareWe unpack staffing practices at CareTech, which we argue are emblematic of technological solutionism. Our analysis reveals that technologists associated different aspects of staffing algorithms with different moral frameworks. We argue that how decisions are made about who is best suited for particular shifts—and why—is changing with the advent and implementation of algorithmic staffing tools as technologists prioritize efficiency. However, discussions with technologists show that there are tensions present in the use of algorithms. On the one hand, technologists discussed their work in terms of trying to increase caregiver performance. Performance Evaluation metrics break care into a set of constituent elements closely aligned with operational efficiency (an appeal to the indus-trial moral framework). On the other hand, technologists described their work as oriented toward establishing long-term relationships between caregivers and care recipients (an appeal to the domestic moral framework).The metrics and measurements that support algorithmic staffing practices are most closely associated with notions of productivity and operational efficiency. Technologists presented one part of their work as oriented toward increasing the “performance, or perceived performance of the caregiver” (Floyd). They described how this work is accomplished by measuring: (1) timeliness (how frequently a caregiver arrives to a shift on time); (2) consistency (adherence to schedule shifts); (3) application usage (whether or not the caregiver uses the application to clock in to and out of shifts and evaluate care recipient well-being); and (4) call-offs (shifts not released seven days in advance). While this evaluation practice makes care legible based on a discrete set of metrics, the composition of these metrics is oriented toward operational efficiency rather than the experiences of care recipients or care coordinators.Technologists contrasted their work with platforms in the ride-hailing industry7, describing how their work was motivated by the desire to establish long-term relationships between caregivers and care recipients. They referenced algorithms in terms that framed care as a holistic practice, often comparing the product of their work to other intimate relationships. Staffing algorithms have a role at two main sites: as initial schedules were made and when other caregivers called off their shifts. When caregivers are scheduled during their onboarding, staff members at CareTech use algorithmic recommendation systems to match caregivers with care recipients.In both cases, platform architects compared the matching process to other intimate relations between caregivers and care recipients.In Sandra’s words: Once the data are all collected, [the algorithm] gives us a list of caregivers, and it was ranked by most likely to be picked up by the caregiver...there is a...I don't want to say negotiating, but there are conversations that go back and forth. Because it does become an arranged marriage when you’re putting it inside thehome.In instances where shifts opened up with clients, the platform gives caregivers the option to pick up shifts with these clients through a user interface that Floyd described as “not not tinder 8 inspired. In advancing these relationship-based arguments, technologists define quality care by referencing domestic relationships between caregivers and care recipients.On the one hand, technologists seek to build a platform that effi-ciently delivers consistent care to a growing number of older adult care recipients. On the other, they describe their work as motivated by a desire to optimize relationships between caregivers and care recipients. At the same time, they framed their efforts as improving fairness, accountability, and transparency in staffing practices. Pair-ing discussions of metrics—which break care down into constituent elements associated with industrial efficiency—with algorithms staffing practices—which technologists use to frame evaluation in domestic terms—reveals that these actors associate different parts of their job with distinct moral frameworks to meet a complex set of demands. Further, interviews with caregivers and coordinators reveal that these performance evaluation criteria and platform staffing practices are a source of tension and stress.4.3 Platform AsymmetriesWhat are the consequences of technologists’ actions? To answer this question, we turn to platform caregivers’ and care coordinators’ per-spectives and experiences. Contrary to technologists’ aspirations touse algorithms to build a fairer, more transparent order, algorithmic staffing practices in fact created new conditions of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. First, we focus on evaluation practices.CareTech’s app for caregivers displays ratings across several met-rics related to operational aspects of care delivery (i.e., timeliness,consistency, application usage, and call-offs). The platform also sends weekly caregiver evaluation surveys to coordinators but does not share this feedback directly with caregivers. Further, caregivers rarely received qualitative feedback regarding the quality of care they provided. Caregivers discussed how these aspects of platform design contributed to ambiguity regarding insight into their perfor-mance, while coordinators approached completing survey-based caregiver evaluations with ambivalence. Second, we analyze care-givers’ interactions with CareTech’s staffing practices. Caregivers described experiencing collapsed boundaries between working and personal time. Despite these new challenges, the caregivers and coordinators we interviewed did not mention a desire to leave. .4.3.1 Ambiguity and Ambivalence. While caregivers described providing care as meaningful and were generally content with the conditions they faced on the platform, they discussed a lack of clarity regarding expectations and performance. As Hayden said:I believe that the clients, they also rate us after every shift. So then if we get rated lowly every time or pretty consistently, I’m sure they will reach out tous...I don’t know that it helps us rate our care and how well we’re doing with our clients, but I don't know how else they could do that...you hear stories of people who are dissatisfied with their care, and that's hard to tell.It was only after connecting with other caregivers that Hayden Learned that it was possible to request a performance evaluation form CareTech. Further, the opacity of metrics created feelings of worry for care-givers about their performance. As a new caregiver on the platform,Hazel worried about a low client consistency rating and discussed needing to take the initiative to understand why she received low ratings across other metrics. Puzzled about low application usage ratings, Hazel described needing to reach out to CareTech to understand “what [she] was missing.” CareTech’s communication and evaluation practices created unclear situations with multiple interpretations and required additional labor on the part of caregivers to understand how care recipients experienced their care and how the platform judged their performance. Coordinators, on the other hand, discussed their own evaluation practices as infused with ambivalence—a finding that we found surprising given the intimate and impactful context of care for an older loved one. While coordinators described clear feelings about the care provided to loved ones, our interviewees responded to CareTech’s evaluation surveys inconsistently. Coordinators expressed satisfaction with the care that caregivers provided and thus did not feel a need to fill out the company’s weekly care-giver evaluation survey, described how these surveys were not as useful compared to in-person evaluations performed over more extended periods, or expressed that they did not feel their feedback through these outlets was listened to by CareTech. Phyllis—who lives with her care recipient—described that since the quality of care was so consistent, there was not a need to be very detailed in her evaluations: “they will send out those [surveys] weekly...soyou click on attentiveness, preparation, and I don’t remember what they all are. There’s about five of them. I don’t get very detailed.” On The other hand, Brooks—who did not live with his care recipient,and was dissatisfied with the consistency of staffing provided byCareTech—described feeling overwhelmed by the amount of eval-uating he was asked to do: “For each one of the caregivers that has been in, they’re asking for an opinion for eight to 10 caregivers everyMonday, on the same thing, the same people doing the same thing.I’ve had a hard time seeing the value on a weekly basis.” He saw more value in evaluations carried out over longer intervals as it had been before the acquisition. There used to be the quarterly report where they would actually go in and visit and come back and say,‘this has changed, or this looks like it’s changed’...when someone steps in four or five times a year those are the ones that can pick out some things.Opal, who uses CareTech to provide care to her husband, discussed her attitude towards the surveys: “Honestly, I ignore [the surveys]. It’s not something I want to do. I don’t know why. I know they're doing great.” These perspectives demonstrate a difference in the worth actors ascribed to particular evaluation practices, high-lighting a mismatch between technologists’, coordinators’, and care-givers’ perspectives. Other coordinators described non-use of CareTech’s evaluation infrastructure, even when there were striking departures from care expectations. Coordinators justified their approach by appealing to different moral frameworks. Riley said, “what did happen onetime, and I should probably be more tuned into it...there was one day when one of the caregivers didn’t show up at all. And I didn't know about it until the next day.” She justified the non-use through appeals to a domestic moral framework: “I’m not as hands-on, I’mnot looking at the app to see what they’re doing. I get my feedback on how they’re doing from my mom and dad.” Winnie, who relied on a caregiver to transport her mother to church on Sunday mornings, described situations where sometimes a caregiver assigned to the shift couldn’t drive or had no car. Even so, she did not fill out regular surveys, drawing on her experience as a business owner (industrial)to express that she understood the challenges of staffing shifts: “it’sa very hard thing to maneuver in the world that we’re walking in. We Own a small business. We employ 13 ladies, so I understand.” At the same time, she seemed to negatively moralize non-use: “I will be honest with you that a survey has come...I haven’t filled it out. So I Haven't done due diligence on my part. You know, so I’m going to own that part.” While some coordinators expressed frustration about consistency, communication, quality, and the efficacy of evaluation practices, they appealed to multiple moral frameworks to justify different uses of evaluation infrastructure.4.3.2 Work Practices and Professional Boundaries. Continued dis-cussion with caregivers provided insight into how the problems that technologists faced contributed to aspects of platform design.The need to fill open shifts and coordinate care work across multiple individuals—associated with an industrial moral framework—took precedence over other concerns. Francine’s account of interactions with CareTech provides an example of how the need to staff shifts devalued communication about performance: “they have never given me any feedback or evaluation, the only time they call is about the schedule, asking if you can work more.” We argue that technologists prioritization of needs associated with the industrial moral frame-work eroded the boundary between caregivers’ work and personal lives and changed care practices.For example, the platform uses a notification system to bring open shifts to caregivers’ attention. However, Pepper describe how the constant notification stream makes it difficult for her to differentiate between work and leisure time:I can tell they have a lot of shifts to fill in. Am I go-ing to be under pressure? They’ve asked me for five things, and you said no to all of them, it feels likeI should say yes to something now. It’s just a little harder to be either working or not working...when you see your phone in the morning and you see all those notifications there.Hayden described receiving “30 to 40” notifications a day from the app, even after reaching out to CareTech to express that they would not work any more shifts. Further, they described confu-sion and frustration regarding the processes by which shifts were initially assigned:I actually said no to [the shift], but they scheduled me anyway. Which was how I got a lot of my shifts,which was okay...I know sometimes it sounds weird,but I would say no to a shift, maybe they’d think thatI said yes.This account suggests that the platform does not allow for as much flexibility as technologists imagine.In contrast to legacy record-keeping procedures, where care-givers left paper-based care notes in clients’ homes, CareTech’splatform requires that caregivers describe their shifts upon clock-ing out in an electronic journal that is viewable by coordinators and other caregivers. While caregivers described that the journal helped them feel more prepared for each shift, they also described reading journal entries outside of working hours, which provided further evidence for blurred boundaries between work and personal life.For example, Chauncey described reading entries “at night, before Igo to bed, I start reading if I’m going to work the next morning.” In Addition, platform architecture requiring caregivers to complete these logs changed caregivers’ relationship to time spent on the job.

After several interviews, one researcher visitedStayHome’s global headquarters and a company-owned agency,located in a major Midwestern city in the U.S. The researcher toured the company’s offices and met with support staff. In addition, theresearcher engaged these actors in informal conversations to learn how StayHome and CareTech operate. To understand how the plat-form is presented to caregivers and what aspects of paid care work are emphasized, the researcher observed a caregiver training ses-sion on lifting and transferring techniques at one of StayHome’scompany-owned franchises and attended a virtual onboarding ses-sion with CareTech in the afternoon.We developed the interview guide with interest in valuation and evaluation practices as they occur on CareTech’s platform. Treating valuation as a moral outlook, we drew on practice-oriented approaches to understanding how different actors conceptualize and contribute value in labor contexts [36]. Examining the practices of the people that develop platforms and those who are subject to their architecture provides an opportunity to identify the underlying justifications and actions that shape and transform care work as it occurs on the ground. Interview questions thus sought to elicit interviewees' daily practices, what elements of their work they described as most important, the least favorite aspects of their work,and their ideological orientation towards the concept of ‘care.’After obtaining consent, we recorded the interviews, which lasted between 45 and 90 minutes and took place mainly over Zoom. However, we did interview several caregivers and one coordinator in person. Team members iteratively refined these themes through discussion and mapped them to the EoW framework. We used a third-party qualitative coding tool (NVivo) to complete the coding process. To make theoretical sense of the data, we returned to the literature and iterated between data and extant research. Our findings indicate that technologists drew on several economies of worth—which we refer to as moral frameworks—to navigate the seemingly irreconcilable demands of home care. They referenced multiple interpretations of the term ‘care’ to resolve contradictions.We illustrate this point by first focusing on how technologists described the problems that they claim to solve. Then, we analyze the nature of the solutions they presented, highlighting how technolo-gists imbued different aspects of algorithm design and function with moral meanings. This finding demonstrates the interpretive flexibil-ity of technological artifacts. Finally, we turn to the perspectives of caregivers and coordinators. Their accounts show how algorithmic staffing practices created new forms of uncertainty—the mirror of technologists' stated intentions.4.1 Navigating Contextual ComplexityTechnologists drew on multiple moral frameworks to navigate expectations and demands, appealing to various interpretations of care’ to reconcile the contradictory pressures they face. The technologists we interviewed framed CareTech as a platform developed to address traditional home care agencies’ logistical and opera-tional challenges. In this context, they appealed to an industrial moral framework, framing their work as introducing greater levels of efficiency and rationalization to the home care industry. How-ever, many of the technologists we interviewed also framed their work in terms of a civic moral framework, critiquing prior staffing practices as subjective, opaque, unfair, and harmful to the material well-being of caregivers. Although these two narratives may appear contradictory, technologists unified these demands by appealing to the societal need for more care. For example, improvements inefficiency were discussed in terms of increasing the affordability of care while improving working conditions was imagined as growing the size of the caregiving workforce. We argue that technologists navigate complexity when creating and developing care algorithms by strategically appealing to justifications corresponding to differ-ent moral frameworks, drawing on multiple interpretations of a single term to move between them. Throughout this section, we draw attention to how technologists position algorithmic staffing practices as one solution to the problems they described.4.1.1 Platform Description & Motivations. The rhetoric that tech-nologists and company executives used to describe their motivation for building the platform appealed to domestic and social goods. In press releases and on the company website, CareTech’s execu-tives described their frustrations in searching for care for their own parents. Similarly, technologists invoked ideas of familial respon-sibility, relaying stories about their difficulties in finding care for aging parents. Technologists also drew on more civic-oriented no-tions of good, framing their work with reference to positive social change. For example, Richard described, “being part of something that can have a positive impact on society.” The company’s mission statement, was described as ‘improving care in society6, highlight-ing the significance of a single moral concept in technologists discourse.In discussing the company’s strategy, the technologists we in-terviewed described CareTech as a “platform,” “communication company,” or “logistical engine,”, foregrounding CareTech’s use of digital technology to improve efficiency, and framed their work asa response to logistical challenges in the home care industry. Aiden described what he framed as the company’s main value proposition:I think the big sort of sell is, it is getting harder and harder to operate care. I think it is getting more expensive...the core value proposition is where we are trying to figure out how to build a platform around doing this, and helping agencies focus more on their relationships with their communities and customers.He elaborated that, by centralizing operations, CareTech offers partner agencies relief from work that is “consuming and grueling,whether it’s paperwork, management, documentation, staffing, lo-gistics, or being on call all the time.” By filling this role, CareTech‘frees up agencies to both source customers and maintain that rela-tionship and kind of connection’ (Aiden). Repeated references to the relationship between CareTech and the agencies with which it partners serve two purposes. First, they identify areas whereCareTech uses technology to increase efficiency in the home care industry. This problem formulation provides the background for how organizational solutions are framed. Second, they format a division of labor. In this account, partner agencies are positioned as responsible for managing relationships in local markets, while the platform oversees aspects of labor control and management.Here, technologists frame the platform’s work in industrial terms and partner agencies in domestic terms. 4.1.2 Staffing Practices as Solutions. As they justified their work,technologists also blended elements from multiple moral frame-works. Specifically, they simultaneously appealed to notions of market dominance and civic responsibility. This overlap materialized as Robert, a data scientist, stated that the company’s scale offered a ‘unified view across markets’ and provided access to a sufficient amount of data to use statistical techniques to ‘learn from the data to provide better home care’, serving as a “competitive dif-ferentiator in the market.” In addition, Floyd framed the company's size as affording more ‘careful’ staffing practice:From a systemic perspective, when you are bigger you have these systems in place, and you do not have to guilt somebody into working a shift. If you need a shift filled, you have a stable of hundreds of caregivers you can reach out to, it is just a matter of how much bonus you have to put on it.These rhetorical strategies demonstrate how technologists draw on multiple moral frameworks to present their work as solutions to different problems.Building on discussions of CareTech’s organizational strategy,technologists most concretely articulated their efforts toward ‘im-proving care in society’ through labor management. They started these discussions by problematizing caregiver job quality under legacy home care practices as associated with low wages, few ben-efits, rigid scheduling practices, and little recognition of caregivers efforts. Kennedy critiqued legacy staffing practices on the grounds of fairness and transparency:There’s a lot of favoritism that happens. There’s a lack of transparency. And so as you can imagine, the caregivers who work the most shifts, they’re able to earn the most amount of money. And that’s really helping to improve their lives and livelihoods. Other technologists framed algorithmic staffing as a solution to the legacy staffing practices that Kennedy identified as opaque and unfair. While Kennedy incorporated concerns about material well-being into her critiques, other technologists generally avoided discussing their efforts toward increasing caregiver job quality in terms of a market-based moral framework. This may have resulted from the market constraints of care, where the price for private pay home care is inaccessible for many families. Aria explainedthat raising wages for caregivers would make the price of care“unpayable” by many clients. 4.1.3 Professionalizing Care. Instead, technologists framed their efforts as attempts to improve caregivers’ status and provide them with a career. Aria noted that improving the collective status of caregivers was part of CareTech’s mission since its founding, em-phasizing challenging aspects of the job:I think that a really big piece of what CareTech is try-ing to do and has been trying to do since the beginning you know, elevate the profession of caregiving. Andtruly treat it a profession instead of just a job...because it's a difficult, emotionally intense, sometimes physi-cally intense thing to do.Floyd described further aspirations to elevate caregivers’ status through professionalization:I would say that [career] is a north star for us. I think everyone views that as an innovation that we can and should make, and the profession is worth it... we're working towards it, but we haven’t actually gotten there yet.These discussions highlight the links that technologists establish between different moral frameworks as they respond to a complex set of challenges. While they expressed concern about the value that care holds in society, increasing the pecuniary value of car was viewed as infeasible. Technologists responded to this problem by appealing to the status of the profession. However, technologists most defined solutions came in the form of staffing algorithms.4.2 Datafying CareWe unpack staffing practices at CareTech, which we argue are emblematic of technological solutionism. Our analysis reveals that technologists associated different aspects of staffing algorithms with different moral frameworks. We argue that how decisions are made about who is best suited for particular shifts—and why—is changing with the advent and implementation of algorithmic staffing tools as technologists prioritize efficiency. However, discussions with technologists show that there are tensions present in the use of algorithms. On the one hand, technologists discussed their work in terms of trying to increase caregiver performance. Performance Evaluation metrics break care into a set of constituent elements closely aligned with operational efficiency (an appeal to the indus-trial moral framework). On the other hand, technologists described their work as oriented toward establishing long-term relationships between caregivers and care recipients (an appeal to the domestic moral framework).The metrics and measurements that support algorithmic staffing practices are most closely associated with notions of productivity and operational efficiency. Technologists presented one part of their work as oriented toward increasing the “performance, or perceived performance of the caregiver” (Floyd). They described how this work is accomplished by measuring: (1) timeliness (how frequently a caregiver arrives to a shift on time); (2) consistency (adherence to schedule shifts); (3) application usage (whether or not the caregiver uses the application to clock in to and out of shifts and evaluate care recipient well-being); and (4) call-offs (shifts not released seven days in advance). While this evaluation practice makes care legible based on a discrete set of metrics, the composition of these metrics is oriented toward operational efficiency rather than the experiences of care recipients or care coordinators.Technologists contrasted their work with platforms in the ride-hailing industry7, describing how their work was motivated by the desire to establish long-term relationships between caregivers and care recipients. They referenced algorithms in terms that framed care as a holistic practice, often comparing the product of their work to other intimate relationships. Staffing algorithms have a role at two main sites: as initial schedules were made and when other caregivers called off their shifts. When caregivers are scheduled during their onboarding, staff members at CareTech use algorithmic recommendation systems to match caregivers with care recipients.In both cases, platform architects compared the matching process to other intimate relations between caregivers and care recipients.In Sandra’s words: Once the data are all collected, [the algorithm] gives us a list of caregivers, and it was ranked by most likely to be picked up by the caregiver...there is a...I don't want to say negotiating, but there are conversations that go back and forth. Because it does become an arranged marriage when you’re putting it inside thehome.In instances where shifts opened up with clients, the platform gives caregivers the option to pick up shifts with these clients through a user interface that Floyd described as “not not tinder 8 inspired. In advancing these relationship-based arguments, technologists define quality care by referencing domestic relationships between caregivers and care recipients.On the one hand, technologists seek to build a platform that effi-ciently delivers consistent care to a growing number of older adult care recipients. On the other, they describe their work as motivated by a desire to optimize relationships between caregivers and care recipients. At the same time, they framed their efforts as improving fairness, accountability, and transparency in staffing practices. Pair-ing discussions of metrics—which break care down into constituent elements associated with industrial efficiency—with algorithms staffing practices—which technologists use to frame evaluation in domestic terms—reveals that these actors associate different parts of their job with distinct moral frameworks to meet a complex set of demands. Further, interviews with caregivers and coordinators reveal that these performance evaluation criteria and platform staffing practices are a source of tension and stress.4.3 Platform AsymmetriesWhat are the consequences of technologists’ actions? To answer this question, we turn to platform caregivers’ and care coordinators’ per-spectives and experiences. Contrary to technologists’ aspirations touse algorithms to build a fairer, more transparent order, algorithmic staffing practices in fact created new conditions of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. First, we focus on evaluation practices.CareTech’s app for caregivers displays ratings across several met-rics related to operational aspects of care delivery (i.e., timeliness,consistency, application usage, and call-offs). The platform also sends weekly caregiver evaluation surveys to coordinators but does not share this feedback directly with caregivers. Further, caregivers rarely received qualitative feedback regarding the quality of care they provided. Caregivers discussed how these aspects of platform design contributed to ambiguity regarding insight into their perfor-mance, while coordinators approached completing survey-based caregiver evaluations with ambivalence. Second, we analyze care-givers’ interactions with CareTech’s staffing practices. Caregivers described experiencing collapsed boundaries between working and personal time. Despite these new challenges, the caregivers and coordinators we interviewed did not mention a desire to leave. .4.3.1 Ambiguity and Ambivalence. While caregivers described providing care as meaningful and were generally content with the conditions they faced on the platform, they discussed a lack of clarity regarding expectations and performance. As Hayden said:I believe that the clients, they also rate us after every shift. So then if we get rated lowly every time or pretty consistently, I’m sure they will reach out tous...I don’t know that it helps us rate our care and how well we’re doing with our clients, but I don't know how else they could do that...you hear stories of people who are dissatisfied with their care, and that's hard to tell.It was only after connecting with other caregivers that Hayden Learned that it was possible to request a performance evaluation form CareTech. Further, the opacity of metrics created feelings of worry for care-givers about their performance. As a new caregiver on the platform,Hazel worried about a low client consistency rating and discussed needing to take the initiative to understand why she received low ratings across other metrics. Puzzled about low application usage ratings, Hazel described needing to reach out to CareTech to understand “what [she] was missing.” CareTech’s communication and evaluation practices created unclear situations with multiple interpretations and required additional labor on the part of caregivers to understand how care recipients experienced their care and how the platform judged their performance. Coordinators, on the other hand, discussed their own evaluation practices as infused with ambivalence—a finding that we found surprising given the intimate and impactful context of care for an older loved one. While coordinators described clear feelings about the care provided to loved ones, our interviewees responded to CareTech’s evaluation surveys inconsistently. Coordinators expressed satisfaction with the care that caregivers provided and thus did not feel a need to fill out the company’s weekly care-giver evaluation survey, described how these surveys were not as useful compared to in-person evaluations performed over more extended periods, or expressed that they did not feel their feedback through these outlets was listened to by CareTech. Phyllis—who lives with her care recipient—described that since the quality of care was so consistent, there was not a need to be very detailed in her evaluations: “they will send out those [surveys] weekly...soyou click on attentiveness, preparation, and I don’t remember what they all are. There’s about five of them. I don’t get very detailed.” On The other hand, Brooks—who did not live with his care recipient,and was dissatisfied with the consistency of staffing provided byCareTech—described feeling overwhelmed by the amount of eval-uating he was asked to do: “For each one of the caregivers that has been in, they’re asking for an opinion for eight to 10 caregivers everyMonday, on the same thing, the same people doing the same thing.I’ve had a hard time seeing the value on a weekly basis.” He saw more value in evaluations carried out over longer intervals as it had been before the acquisition. There used to be the quarterly report where they would actually go in and visit and come back and say,‘this has changed, or this looks like it’s changed’...when someone steps in four or five times a year those are the ones that can pick out some things.Opal, who uses CareTech to provide care to her husband, discussed her attitude towards the surveys: “Honestly, I ignore [the surveys]. It’s not something I want to do. I don’t know why. I know they're doing great.” These perspectives demonstrate a difference in the worth actors ascribed to particular evaluation practices, high-lighting a mismatch between technologists’, coordinators’, and care-givers’ perspectives. Other coordinators described non-use of CareTech’s evaluation infrastructure, even when there were striking departures from care expectations. Coordinators justified their approach by appealing to different moral frameworks. Riley said, “what did happen onetime, and I should probably be more tuned into it...there was one day when one of the caregivers didn’t show up at all. And I didn't know about it until the next day.” She justified the non-use through appeals to a domestic moral framework: “I’m not as hands-on, I’mnot looking at the app to see what they’re doing. I get my feedback on how they’re doing from my mom and dad.” Winnie, who relied on a caregiver to transport her mother to church on Sunday mornings, described situations where sometimes a caregiver assigned to the shift couldn’t drive or had no car. Even so, she did not fill out regular surveys, drawing on her experience as a business owner (industrial)to express that she understood the challenges of staffing shifts: “it’sa very hard thing to maneuver in the world that we’re walking in. We Own a small business. We employ 13 ladies, so I understand.” At the same time, she seemed to negatively moralize non-use: “I will be honest with you that a survey has come...I haven’t filled it out. So I Haven't done due diligence on my part. You know, so I’m going to own that part.” While some coordinators expressed frustration about consistency, communication, quality, and the efficacy of evaluation practices, they appealed to multiple moral frameworks to justify different uses of evaluation infrastructure.4.3.2 Work Practices and Professional Boundaries. Continued dis-cussion with caregivers provided insight into how the problems that technologists faced contributed to aspects of platform design.The need to fill open shifts and coordinate care work across multiple individuals—associated with an industrial moral framework—took precedence over other concerns. Francine’s account of interactions with CareTech provides an example of how the need to staff shifts devalued communication about performance: “they have never given me any feedback or evaluation, the only time they call is about the schedule, asking if you can work more.” We argue that technologists prioritization of needs associated with the industrial moral frame-work eroded the boundary between caregivers’ work and personal lives and changed care practices.For example, the platform uses a notification system to bring open shifts to caregivers’ attention. However, Pepper describe how the constant notification stream makes it difficult for her to differentiate between work and leisure time:I can tell they have a lot of shifts to fill in. Am I go-ing to be under pressure? They’ve asked me for five things, and you said no to all of them, it feels likeI should say yes to something now. It’s just a little harder to be either working or not working...when you see your phone in the morning and you see all those notifications there.Hayden described receiving “30 to 40” notifications a day from the app, even after reaching out to CareTech to express that they would not work any more shifts. Further, they described confu-sion and frustration regarding the processes by which shifts were initially assigned:I actually said no to [the shift], but they scheduled me anyway. Which was how I got a lot of my shifts,which was okay...I know sometimes it sounds weird,but I would say no to a shift, maybe they’d think thatI said yes.This account suggests that the platform does not allow for as much flexibility as technologists imagine.In contrast to legacy record-keeping procedures, where care-givers left paper-based care notes in clients’ homes, CareTech’splatform requires that caregivers describe their shifts upon clock-ing out in an electronic journal that is viewable by coordinators and other caregivers. While caregivers described that the journal helped them feel more prepared for each shift, they also described reading journal entries outside of working hours, which provided further evidence for blurred boundaries between work and personal life.For example, Chauncey described reading entries “at night, before Igo to bed, I start reading if I’m going to work the next morning.” In Addition, platform architecture requiring caregivers to complete these logs changed caregivers’ relationship to time spent on the job. Francine described how filling out the notes, especially in the time-sensitive context of a shift, placed pressure on how she spent time providing care: “if you clock out right at a minute after [your shift ends] they get you on that.” Efforts to avoid disciplinary action created new relationships to time: “I just always try to clock out a few minutes before because you get all these questions before closing out the app” (Francine). In these cases, platform architecture changed caregivers' relationships with their time both on and off the clock,which put caregivers under additional pressure.We found that aspects of platform and algorithm design create new forms of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. We argue that this results from a mismatch between technologists’ moral reasoning and that of other platform actors. In addition, the need to fill open shifts and coordinate work across many individuals pri-oritizes a logic of efficiency over concerns for caregiver job quality.Despite coordinators’ unmet expectations and new pressures that the platform placed on caregivers, both sets of actors maintain a commitment to the platform. A possible explanation for contin-ued attachment is the moral significance of ‘care.’ While the term carries various meanings across actors and situations, it may act as a resource that maintains a particular status quo by mitigating organized critique of or departure from the platform.

56,OpacityOfMetrics,constrainsAgent,Caregivers,"The subject of our case study, CareTech4, is one of several start-upsthat are credited with “reinventing the [home care] agency model”[22]. Prior to data collection, CareTech acquired StayHome, a traditional home care agency franchise. To contextualize our findings,we briefly discuss CareTech’s business model.CareTech partners with traditional home care agencies to support back-end administrative, legal, compliance, and logistics functions in exchange for a share of partner agencies’ revenue, employing caregivers directly. Caregivers assist with activities of daily living(i.e., bathing, dressing, getting in or out of a bed or chair, walking,using the toilet, eating) [43], and instrumental activities of daily living (i.e., cooking, cleaning, transportation, laundry, managing finances) [46]. CareTech’s use of algorithms to match caregivers to care recipients is central to our case. When we started data collection, CareTech’s technology platform had recently been im-plemented at StayHome’s company-owned agencies, providing a unique opportunity to investigate care algorithm implementation.In this paper, we focus primarily on CareTech’s staffing prac-tices. CareTech uses metrics and algorithms, along with human management, to staff shifts. Staffing algorithms have a role at two main sites: as initial schedules were made and when other care-givers called off their shifts. When caregivers are scheduled during their onboarding, staff members at CareTech use algorithmic recommendation systems to match caregivers with care recipients. Evaluation metrics (i.e., timeliness, consistency, application usage,and call-offs), along with other data (e.g., caregiver commute time,number of complaints) are used to match caregivers and care recipients. Coordinators receive weekly surveys about the quality of care provided, and provide responses on a linear scale5. After IRB approval, we recruited participants—technologists (n =14), caregivers (n = 9), and coordinators (n = 7)—through a partnership with CareTech and StayHome for interviews using convenience and purposive sampling [10]. StayHome’s research staff arranged site visit and helped recruit participants. We provided a brief description of the study and a screening questionnaire distributed amongst the caregivers and coordinators over email. This approach provided an opportunity to learn from technologists, caregivers,coordinators who were enthusiastic about sharing their experi-ences with the platform. Table 2 and table 3 provide an overview of participant profiles.(1) Technologists: Technologists consisted of software engi-neers, designers, product managers, and data and opera-tions workers. Software engineers talked about buildingCareTech’s features and the company’s history. Designers Develop CareTech’s front-end user experience for caregivers.Designers, the operations team, and a product manager described how they approached curating the caregiver experi-ence. The data scientists, data analysts, and data stewards dis-cussed the metrics used to measure caregiver performance,the data that staffing algorithms use, and how algorithms work in practice.(2) Caregivers: We use the term ‘caregivers’ to refer to the people employed by CareTech to provide care for pay.(3) Coordinators: The term ‘coordinators’ refers to people that pay for CareTech’s services and coordinate their delivery,usually on behalf of an older loved one. Recruiting interview participants through a partnership with Stay-Home and CareTech potentially biased results toward more positive perspectives of organizational practices. Caregivers and coordina-tors with more negative views about the company may have been reluctant to share their opinions or participate in interviews alto-gether due to fears of retaliation from the platform. Convenience Sampling limited the extent to which we were able to understand differences across demographic subgroups. Future work should explore this issue. Further, recruitment overlooked the perspectives of care coordinators and caregivers who have left the platform due to difficulties This study draws on data gathered from one week of observations performed in July 2022 and 30 interviews conducted between May2022 and August 2022. We conducted in-depth interviews to understand the cultural inputs that shape algorithm design and the implications for caregivers and coordinators. Interviews are well-suited for understanding social dimensions of how people interpret the world and take actions based on those interpretations [64]. Interviews with technology workers show how they make sense of their work and build systems [67], and interviews with caregivers and coordinators show that care practices diverge from organizational philosophy [53].

Andtruly treat it a profession instead of just a job...because it's a difficult, emotionally intense, sometimes physi-cally intense thing to do.Floyd described further aspirations to elevate caregivers’ status through professionalization:I would say that [career] is a north star for us. I think everyone views that as an innovation that we can and should make, and the profession is worth it... we're working towards it, but we haven’t actually gotten there yet.These discussions highlight the links that technologists establish between different moral frameworks as they respond to a complex set of challenges. While they expressed concern about the value that care holds in society, increasing the pecuniary value of car was viewed as infeasible. Technologists responded to this problem by appealing to the status of the profession. However, technologists most defined solutions came in the form of staffing algorithms.4.2 Datafying CareWe unpack staffing practices at CareTech, which we argue are emblematic of technological solutionism. Our analysis reveals that technologists associated different aspects of staffing algorithms with different moral frameworks. We argue that how decisions are made about who is best suited for particular shifts—and why—is changing with the advent and implementation of algorithmic staffing tools as technologists prioritize efficiency. However, discussions with technologists show that there are tensions present in the use of algorithms. On the one hand, technologists discussed their work in terms of trying to increase caregiver performance. Performance Evaluation metrics break care into a set of constituent elements closely aligned with operational efficiency (an appeal to the indus-trial moral framework). On the other hand, technologists described their work as oriented toward establishing long-term relationships between caregivers and care recipients (an appeal to the domestic moral framework).The metrics and measurements that support algorithmic staffing practices are most closely associated with notions of productivity and operational efficiency. Technologists presented one part of their work as oriented toward increasing the “performance, or perceived performance of the caregiver” (Floyd). They described how this work is accomplished by measuring: (1) timeliness (how frequently a caregiver arrives to a shift on time); (2) consistency (adherence to schedule shifts); (3) application usage (whether or not the caregiver uses the application to clock in to and out of shifts and evaluate care recipient well-being); and (4) call-offs (shifts not released seven days in advance). While this evaluation practice makes care legible based on a discrete set of metrics, the composition of these metrics is oriented toward operational efficiency rather than the experiences of care recipients or care coordinators.Technologists contrasted their work with platforms in the ride-hailing industry7, describing how their work was motivated by the desire to establish long-term relationships between caregivers and care recipients. They referenced algorithms in terms that framed care as a holistic practice, often comparing the product of their work to other intimate relationships. Staffing algorithms have a role at two main sites: as initial schedules were made and when other caregivers called off their shifts. When caregivers are scheduled during their onboarding, staff members at CareTech use algorithmic recommendation systems to match caregivers with care recipients.In both cases, platform architects compared the matching process to other intimate relations between caregivers and care recipients.In Sandra’s words: Once the data are all collected, [the algorithm] gives us a list of caregivers, and it was ranked by most likely to be picked up by the caregiver...there is a...I don't want to say negotiating, but there are conversations that go back and forth. Because it does become an arranged marriage when you’re putting it inside thehome.In instances where shifts opened up with clients, the platform gives caregivers the option to pick up shifts with these clients through a user interface that Floyd described as “not not tinder 8 inspired. In advancing these relationship-based arguments, technologists define quality care by referencing domestic relationships between caregivers and care recipients.On the one hand, technologists seek to build a platform that effi-ciently delivers consistent care to a growing number of older adult care recipients. On the other, they describe their work as motivated by a desire to optimize relationships between caregivers and care recipients. At the same time, they framed their efforts as improving fairness, accountability, and transparency in staffing practices. Pair-ing discussions of metrics—which break care down into constituent elements associated with industrial efficiency—with algorithms staffing practices—which technologists use to frame evaluation in domestic terms—reveals that these actors associate different parts of their job with distinct moral frameworks to meet a complex set of demands. Further, interviews with caregivers and coordinators reveal that these performance evaluation criteria and platform staffing practices are a source of tension and stress.4.3 Platform AsymmetriesWhat are the consequences of technologists’ actions? To answer this question, we turn to platform caregivers’ and care coordinators’ per-spectives and experiences. Contrary to technologists’ aspirations touse algorithms to build a fairer, more transparent order, algorithmic staffing practices in fact created new conditions of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. First, we focus on evaluation practices.CareTech’s app for caregivers displays ratings across several met-rics related to operational aspects of care delivery (i.e., timeliness,consistency, application usage, and call-offs). The platform also sends weekly caregiver evaluation surveys to coordinators but does not share this feedback directly with caregivers. Further, caregivers rarely received qualitative feedback regarding the quality of care they provided. Caregivers discussed how these aspects of platform design contributed to ambiguity regarding insight into their perfor-mance, while coordinators approached completing survey-based caregiver evaluations with ambivalence. Second, we analyze care-givers’ interactions with CareTech’s staffing practices. Caregivers described experiencing collapsed boundaries between working and personal time. Despite these new challenges, the caregivers and coordinators we interviewed did not mention a desire to leave. .4.3.1 Ambiguity and Ambivalence. While caregivers described providing care as meaningful and were generally content with the conditions they faced on the platform, they discussed a lack of clarity regarding expectations and performance. As Hayden said:I believe that the clients, they also rate us after every shift. So then if we get rated lowly every time or pretty consistently, I’m sure they will reach out tous...I don’t know that it helps us rate our care and how well we’re doing with our clients, but I don't know how else they could do that...you hear stories of people who are dissatisfied with their care, and that's hard to tell.It was only after connecting with other caregivers that Hayden Learned that it was possible to request a performance evaluation form CareTech. Further, the opacity of metrics created feelings of worry for care-givers about their performance. As a new caregiver on the platform,Hazel worried about a low client consistency rating and discussed needing to take the initiative to understand why she received low ratings across other metrics. Puzzled about low application usage ratings, Hazel described needing to reach out to CareTech to understand “what [she] was missing.” CareTech’s communication and evaluation practices created unclear situations with multiple interpretations and required additional labor on the part of caregivers to understand how care recipients experienced their care and how the platform judged their performance. Coordinators, on the other hand, discussed their own evaluation practices as infused with ambivalence—a finding that we found surprising given the intimate and impactful context of care for an older loved one. While coordinators described clear feelings about the care provided to loved ones, our interviewees responded to CareTech’s evaluation surveys inconsistently. Coordinators expressed satisfaction with the care that caregivers provided and thus did not feel a need to fill out the company’s weekly care-giver evaluation survey, described how these surveys were not as useful compared to in-person evaluations performed over more extended periods, or expressed that they did not feel their feedback through these outlets was listened to by CareTech. Phyllis—who lives with her care recipient—described that since the quality of care was so consistent, there was not a need to be very detailed in her evaluations: “they will send out those [surveys] weekly...soyou click on attentiveness, preparation, and I don’t remember what they all are. There’s about five of them. I don’t get very detailed.” On The other hand, Brooks—who did not live with his care recipient,and was dissatisfied with the consistency of staffing provided byCareTech—described feeling overwhelmed by the amount of eval-uating he was asked to do: “For each one of the caregivers that has been in, they’re asking for an opinion for eight to 10 caregivers everyMonday, on the same thing, the same people doing the same thing.I’ve had a hard time seeing the value on a weekly basis.” He saw more value in evaluations carried out over longer intervals as it had been before the acquisition. There used to be the quarterly report where they would actually go in and visit and come back and say,‘this has changed, or this looks like it’s changed’...when someone steps in four or five times a year those are the ones that can pick out some things.Opal, who uses CareTech to provide care to her husband, discussed her attitude towards the surveys: “Honestly, I ignore [the surveys]. It’s not something I want to do. I don’t know why. I know they're doing great.” These perspectives demonstrate a difference in the worth actors ascribed to particular evaluation practices, high-lighting a mismatch between technologists’, coordinators’, and care-givers’ perspectives. Other coordinators described non-use of CareTech’s evaluation infrastructure, even when there were striking departures from care expectations. Coordinators justified their approach by appealing to different moral frameworks. Riley said, “what did happen onetime, and I should probably be more tuned into it...there was one day when one of the caregivers didn’t show up at all. And I didn't know about it until the next day.” She justified the non-use through appeals to a domestic moral framework: “I’m not as hands-on, I’mnot looking at the app to see what they’re doing. I get my feedback on how they’re doing from my mom and dad.” Winnie, who relied on a caregiver to transport her mother to church on Sunday mornings, described situations where sometimes a caregiver assigned to the shift couldn’t drive or had no car. Even so, she did not fill out regular surveys, drawing on her experience as a business owner (industrial)to express that she understood the challenges of staffing shifts: “it’sa very hard thing to maneuver in the world that we’re walking in. We Own a small business. We employ 13 ladies, so I understand.” At the same time, she seemed to negatively moralize non-use: “I will be honest with you that a survey has come...I haven’t filled it out. So I Haven't done due diligence on my part. You know, so I’m going to own that part.” While some coordinators expressed frustration about consistency, communication, quality, and the efficacy of evaluation practices, they appealed to multiple moral frameworks to justify different uses of evaluation infrastructure.4.3.2 Work Practices and Professional Boundaries. Continued dis-cussion with caregivers provided insight into how the problems that technologists faced contributed to aspects of platform design.The need to fill open shifts and coordinate care work across multiple individuals—associated with an industrial moral framework—took precedence over other concerns. Francine’s account of interactions with CareTech provides an example of how the need to staff shifts devalued communication about performance: “they have never given me any feedback or evaluation, the only time they call is about the schedule, asking if you can work more.” We argue that technologists prioritization of needs associated with the industrial moral frame-work eroded the boundary between caregivers’ work and personal lives and changed care practices.For example, the platform uses a notification system to bring open shifts to caregivers’ attention. However, Pepper describe how the constant notification stream makes it difficult for her to differentiate between work and leisure time:I can tell they have a lot of shifts to fill in. Am I go-ing to be under pressure? They’ve asked me for five things, and you said no to all of them, it feels likeI should say yes to something now. It’s just a little harder to be either working or not working...when you see your phone in the morning and you see all those notifications there.Hayden described receiving “30 to 40” notifications a day from the app, even after reaching out to CareTech to express that they would not work any more shifts. Further, they described confu-sion and frustration regarding the processes by which shifts were initially assigned:I actually said no to [the shift], but they scheduled me anyway. Which was how I got a lot of my shifts,which was okay...I know sometimes it sounds weird,but I would say no to a shift, maybe they’d think thatI said yes.This account suggests that the platform does not allow for as much flexibility as technologists imagine.In contrast to legacy record-keeping procedures, where care-givers left paper-based care notes in clients’ homes, CareTech’splatform requires that caregivers describe their shifts upon clock-ing out in an electronic journal that is viewable by coordinators and other caregivers. While caregivers described that the journal helped them feel more prepared for each shift, they also described reading journal entries outside of working hours, which provided further evidence for blurred boundaries between work and personal life.For example, Chauncey described reading entries “at night, before Igo to bed, I start reading if I’m going to work the next morning.” In Addition, platform architecture requiring caregivers to complete these logs changed caregivers’ relationship to time spent on the job. Francine described how filling out the notes, especially in the time-sensitive context of a shift, placed pressure on how she spent time providing care: “if you clock out right at a minute after [your shift ends] they get you on that.” Efforts to avoid disciplinary action created new relationships to time: “I just always try to clock out a few minutes before because you get all these questions before closing out the app” (Francine). In these cases, platform architecture changed caregivers' relationships with their time both on and off the clock,which put caregivers under additional pressure.We found that aspects of platform and algorithm design create new forms of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. We argue that this results from a mismatch between technologists’ moral reasoning and that of other platform actors. In addition, the need to fill open shifts and coordinate work across many individuals pri-oritizes a logic of efficiency over concerns for caregiver job quality.Despite coordinators’ unmet expectations and new pressures that the platform placed on caregivers, both sets of actors maintain a commitment to the platform. A possible explanation for contin-ued attachment is the moral significance of ‘care.’ While the term carries various meanings across actors and situations, it may act as a resource that maintains a particular status quo by mitigating organized critique of or departure from the platform.

57,Ambivalence,constrainsAgent,Coordinators,"The subject of our case study, CareTech4, is one of several start-upsthat are credited with “reinventing the [home care] agency model”[22]. Prior to data collection, CareTech acquired StayHome, a traditional home care agency franchise. To contextualize our findings,we briefly discuss CareTech’s business model.CareTech partners with traditional home care agencies to support back-end administrative, legal, compliance, and logistics functions in exchange for a share of partner agencies’ revenue, employing caregivers directly. Caregivers assist with activities of daily living(i.e., bathing, dressing, getting in or out of a bed or chair, walking,using the toilet, eating) [43], and instrumental activities of daily living (i.e., cooking, cleaning, transportation, laundry, managing finances) [46]. CareTech’s use of algorithms to match caregivers to care recipients is central to our case. When we started data collection, CareTech’s technology platform had recently been im-plemented at StayHome’s company-owned agencies, providing a unique opportunity to investigate care algorithm implementation.In this paper, we focus primarily on CareTech’s staffing prac-tices. CareTech uses metrics and algorithms, along with human management, to staff shifts. Staffing algorithms have a role at two main sites: as initial schedules were made and when other care-givers called off their shifts. When caregivers are scheduled during their onboarding, staff members at CareTech use algorithmic recommendation systems to match caregivers with care recipients. Evaluation metrics (i.e., timeliness, consistency, application usage,and call-offs), along with other data (e.g., caregiver commute time,number of complaints) are used to match caregivers and care recipients. Coordinators receive weekly surveys about the quality of care provided, and provide responses on a linear scale5. After IRB approval, we recruited participants—technologists (n =14), caregivers (n = 9), and coordinators (n = 7)—through a partnership with CareTech and StayHome for interviews using convenience and purposive sampling [10]. StayHome’s research staff arranged site visit and helped recruit participants. We provided a brief description of the study and a screening questionnaire distributed amongst the caregivers and coordinators over email. This approach provided an opportunity to learn from technologists, caregivers,coordinators who were enthusiastic about sharing their experi-ences with the platform. Table 2 and table 3 provide an overview of participant profiles.(1) Technologists: Technologists consisted of software engi-neers, designers, product managers, and data and opera-tions workers. Software engineers talked about buildingCareTech’s features and the company’s history. Designers Develop CareTech’s front-end user experience for caregivers.Designers, the operations team, and a product manager described how they approached curating the caregiver experi-ence. The data scientists, data analysts, and data stewards dis-cussed the metrics used to measure caregiver performance,the data that staffing algorithms use, and how algorithms work in practice.(2) Caregivers: We use the term ‘caregivers’ to refer to the people employed by CareTech to provide care for pay.(3) Coordinators: The term ‘coordinators’ refers to people that pay for CareTech’s services and coordinate their delivery,usually on behalf of an older loved one. Recruiting interview participants through a partnership with Stay-Home and CareTech potentially biased results toward more positive perspectives of organizational practices. Caregivers and coordina-tors with more negative views about the company may have been reluctant to share their opinions or participate in interviews alto-gether due to fears of retaliation from the platform. Convenience Sampling limited the extent to which we were able to understand differences across demographic subgroups. Future work should explore this issue. Further, recruitment overlooked the perspectives of care coordinators and caregivers who have left the platform due to difficulties This study draws on data gathered from one week of observations performed in July 2022 and 30 interviews conducted between May2022 and August 2022. We conducted in-depth interviews to understand the cultural inputs that shape algorithm design and the implications for caregivers and coordinators. Interviews are well-suited for understanding social dimensions of how people interpret the world and take actions based on those interpretations [64]. Interviews with technology workers show how they make sense of their work and build systems [67], and interviews with caregivers and coordinators show that care practices diverge from organizational philosophy [53]. After several interviews, one researcher visitedStayHome’s global headquarters and a company-owned agency,located in a major Midwestern city in the U.S. The researcher toured the company’s offices and met with support staff. In addition, theresearcher engaged these actors in informal conversations to learn how StayHome and CareTech operate. To understand how the plat-form is presented to caregivers and what aspects of paid care work are emphasized, the researcher observed a caregiver training ses-sion on lifting and transferring techniques at one of StayHome’scompany-owned franchises and attended a virtual onboarding ses-sion with CareTech in the afternoon.We developed the interview guide with interest in valuation and evaluation practices as they occur on CareTech’s platform. Treating valuation as a moral outlook, we drew on practice-oriented approaches to understanding how different actors conceptualize and contribute value in labor contexts [36]. Examining the practices of the people that develop platforms and those who are subject to their architecture provides an opportunity to identify the underlying justifications and actions that shape and transform care work as it occurs on the ground. Interview questions thus sought to elicit interviewees' daily practices, what elements of their work they described as most important, the least favorite aspects of their work,and their ideological orientation towards the concept of ‘care.’After obtaining consent, we recorded the interviews, which lasted between 45 and 90 minutes and took place mainly over Zoom. However, we did interview several caregivers and one coordinator in person. Team members iteratively refined these themes through discussion and mapped them to the EoW framework. We used a third-party qualitative coding tool (NVivo) to complete the coding process. To make theoretical sense of the data, we returned to the literature and iterated between data and extant research. Our findings indicate that technologists drew on several economies of worth—which we refer to as moral frameworks—to navigate the seemingly irreconcilable demands of home care. They referenced multiple interpretations of the term ‘care’ to resolve contradictions.We illustrate this point by first focusing on how technologists described the problems that they claim to solve. Then, we analyze the nature of the solutions they presented, highlighting how technolo-gists imbued different aspects of algorithm design and function with moral meanings. This finding demonstrates the interpretive flexibil-ity of technological artifacts. Finally, we turn to the perspectives of caregivers and coordinators. Their accounts show how algorithmic staffing practices created new forms of uncertainty—the mirror of technologists' stated intentions.4.1 Navigating Contextual ComplexityTechnologists drew on multiple moral frameworks to navigate expectations and demands, appealing to various interpretations of care’ to reconcile the contradictory pressures they face. The technologists we interviewed framed CareTech as a platform developed to address traditional home care agencies’ logistical and opera-tional challenges. In this context, they appealed to an industrial moral framework, framing their work as introducing greater levels of efficiency and rationalization to the home care industry. How-ever, many of the technologists we interviewed also framed their work in terms of a civic moral framework, critiquing prior staffing practices as subjective, opaque, unfair, and harmful to the material well-being of caregivers. Although these two narratives may appear contradictory, technologists unified these demands by appealing to the societal need for more care. For example, improvements inefficiency were discussed in terms of increasing the affordability of care while improving working conditions was imagined as growing the size of the caregiving workforce. We argue that technologists navigate complexity when creating and developing care algorithms by strategically appealing to justifications corresponding to differ-ent moral frameworks, drawing on multiple interpretations of a single term to move between them. Throughout this section, we draw attention to how technologists position algorithmic staffing practices as one solution to the problems they described.4.1.1 Platform Description & Motivations. The rhetoric that tech-nologists and company executives used to describe their motivation for building the platform appealed to domestic and social goods. In press releases and on the company website, CareTech’s execu-tives described their frustrations in searching for care for their own parents. Similarly, technologists invoked ideas of familial respon-sibility, relaying stories about their difficulties in finding care for aging parents. Technologists also drew on more civic-oriented no-tions of good, framing their work with reference to positive social change. For example, Richard described, “being part of something that can have a positive impact on society.” The company’s mission statement, was described as ‘improving care in society6, highlight-ing the significance of a single moral concept in technologists discourse.In discussing the company’s strategy, the technologists we in-terviewed described CareTech as a “platform,” “communication company,” or “logistical engine,”, foregrounding CareTech’s use of digital technology to improve efficiency, and framed their work asa response to logistical challenges in the home care industry. Aiden described what he framed as the company’s main value proposition:I think the big sort of sell is, it is getting harder and harder to operate care. I think it is getting more expensive...the core value proposition is where we are trying to figure out how to build a platform around doing this, and helping agencies focus more on their relationships with their communities and customers.He elaborated that, by centralizing operations, CareTech offers partner agencies relief from work that is “consuming and grueling,whether it’s paperwork, management, documentation, staffing, lo-gistics, or being on call all the time.” By filling this role, CareTech‘frees up agencies to both source customers and maintain that rela-tionship and kind of connection’ (Aiden). Repeated references to the relationship between CareTech and the agencies with which it partners serve two purposes. First, they identify areas whereCareTech uses technology to increase efficiency in the home care industry. This problem formulation provides the background for how organizational solutions are framed. Second, they format a division of labor. In this account, partner agencies are positioned as responsible for managing relationships in local markets, while the platform oversees aspects of labor control and management.Here, technologists frame the platform’s work in industrial terms and partner agencies in domestic terms. 4.1.2 Staffing Practices as Solutions. As they justified their work,technologists also blended elements from multiple moral frame-works. Specifically, they simultaneously appealed to notions of market dominance and civic responsibility. This overlap materialized as Robert, a data scientist, stated that the company’s scale offered a ‘unified view across markets’ and provided access to a sufficient amount of data to use statistical techniques to ‘learn from the data to provide better home care’, serving as a “competitive dif-ferentiator in the market.” In addition, Floyd framed the company's size as affording more ‘careful’ staffing practice:From a systemic perspective, when you are bigger you have these systems in place, and you do not have to guilt somebody into working a shift. If you need a shift filled, you have a stable of hundreds of caregivers you can reach out to, it is just a matter of how much bonus you have to put on it.These rhetorical strategies demonstrate how technologists draw on multiple moral frameworks to present their work as solutions to different problems.Building on discussions of CareTech’s organizational strategy,technologists most concretely articulated their efforts toward ‘im-proving care in society’ through labor management. They started these discussions by problematizing caregiver job quality under legacy home care practices as associated with low wages, few ben-efits, rigid scheduling practices, and little recognition of caregivers efforts. Kennedy critiqued legacy staffing practices on the grounds of fairness and transparency:There’s a lot of favoritism that happens. There’s a lack of transparency. And so as you can imagine, the caregivers who work the most shifts, they’re able to earn the most amount of money. And that’s really helping to improve their lives and livelihoods. Other technologists framed algorithmic staffing as a solution to the legacy staffing practices that Kennedy identified as opaque and unfair. While Kennedy incorporated concerns about material well-being into her critiques, other technologists generally avoided discussing their efforts toward increasing caregiver job quality in terms of a market-based moral framework. This may have resulted from the market constraints of care, where the price for private pay home care is inaccessible for many families. Aria explainedthat raising wages for caregivers would make the price of care“unpayable” by many clients. 4.1.3 Professionalizing Care. Instead, technologists framed their efforts as attempts to improve caregivers’ status and provide them with a career. Aria noted that improving the collective status of caregivers was part of CareTech’s mission since its founding, em-phasizing challenging aspects of the job:I think that a really big piece of what CareTech is try-ing to do and has been trying to do since the beginning you know, elevate the profession of caregiving. Andtruly treat it a profession instead of just a job...because it's a difficult, emotionally intense, sometimes physi-cally intense thing to do.Floyd described further aspirations to elevate caregivers’ status through professionalization:I would say that [career] is a north star for us. I think everyone views that as an innovation that we can and should make, and the profession is worth it... we're working towards it, but we haven’t actually gotten there yet.These discussions highlight the links that technologists establish between different moral frameworks as they respond to a complex set of challenges. While they expressed concern about the value that care holds in society, increasing the pecuniary value of car was viewed as infeasible. Technologists responded to this problem by appealing to the status of the profession. However, technologists most defined solutions came in the form of staffing algorithms.4.2 Datafying CareWe unpack staffing practices at CareTech, which we argue are emblematic of technological solutionism.

Contrary to technologists’ aspirations touse algorithms to build a fairer, more transparent order, algorithmic staffing practices in fact created new conditions of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. First, we focus on evaluation practices.CareTech’s app for caregivers displays ratings across several met-rics related to operational aspects of care delivery (i.e., timeliness,consistency, application usage, and call-offs). The platform also sends weekly caregiver evaluation surveys to coordinators but does not share this feedback directly with caregivers.

There used to be the quarterly report where they would actually go in and visit and come back and say,‘this has changed, or this looks like it’s changed’...when someone steps in four or five times a year those are the ones that can pick out some things.Opal, who uses CareTech to provide care to her husband, discussed her attitude towards the surveys: “Honestly, I ignore [the surveys]. It’s not something I want to do. I don’t know why. I know they're doing great.” These perspectives demonstrate a difference in the worth actors ascribed to particular evaluation practices, high-lighting a mismatch between technologists’, coordinators’, and care-givers’ perspectives. Other coordinators described non-use of CareTech’s evaluation infrastructure, even when there were striking departures from care expectations. Coordinators justified their approach by appealing to different moral frameworks. Riley said, “what did happen onetime, and I should probably be more tuned into it...there was one day when one of the caregivers didn’t show up at all. And I didn't know about it until the next day.” She justified the non-use through appeals to a domestic moral framework: “I’m not as hands-on, I’mnot looking at the app to see what they’re doing. I get my feedback on how they’re doing from my mom and dad.” Winnie, who relied on a caregiver to transport her mother to church on Sunday mornings, described situations where sometimes a caregiver assigned to the shift couldn’t drive or had no car. Even so, she did not fill out regular surveys, drawing on her experience as a business owner (industrial)to express that she understood the challenges of staffing shifts: “it’sa very hard thing to maneuver in the world that we’re walking in. We Own a small business. We employ 13 ladies, so I understand.” At the same time, she seemed to negatively moralize non-use: “I will be honest with you that a survey has come...I haven’t filled it out. So I Haven't done due diligence on my part. You know, so I’m going to own that part.” While some coordinators expressed frustration about consistency, communication, quality, and the efficacy of evaluation practices, they appealed to multiple moral frameworks to justify different uses of evaluation infrastructure.4.3.2 Work Practices and Professional Boundaries. Continued dis-cussion with caregivers provided insight into how the problems that technologists faced contributed to aspects of platform design.The need to fill open shifts and coordinate care work across multiple individuals—associated with an industrial moral framework—took precedence over other concerns. Francine’s account of interactions with CareTech provides an example of how the need to staff shifts devalued communication about performance: “they have never given me any feedback or evaluation, the only time they call is about the schedule, asking if you can work more.” We argue that technologists prioritization of needs associated with the industrial moral frame-work eroded the boundary between caregivers’ work and personal lives and changed care practices.For example, the platform uses a notification system to bring open shifts to caregivers’ attention. However, Pepper describe how the constant notification stream makes it difficult for her to differentiate between work and leisure time:I can tell they have a lot of shifts to fill in. Am I go-ing to be under pressure? They’ve asked me for five things, and you said no to all of them, it feels likeI should say yes to something now. It’s just a little harder to be either working or not working...when you see your phone in the morning and you see all those notifications there.Hayden described receiving “30 to 40” notifications a day from the app, even after reaching out to CareTech to express that they would not work any more shifts. Further, they described confu-sion and frustration regarding the processes by which shifts were initially assigned:I actually said no to [the shift], but they scheduled me anyway. Which was how I got a lot of my shifts,which was okay...I know sometimes it sounds weird,but I would say no to a shift, maybe they’d think thatI said yes.This account suggests that the platform does not allow for as much flexibility as technologists imagine.In contrast to legacy record-keeping procedures, where care-givers left paper-based care notes in clients’ homes, CareTech’splatform requires that caregivers describe their shifts upon clock-ing out in an electronic journal that is viewable by coordinators and other caregivers. While caregivers described that the journal helped them feel more prepared for each shift, they also described reading journal entries outside of working hours, which provided further evidence for blurred boundaries between work and personal life.For example, Chauncey described reading entries “at night, before Igo to bed, I start reading if I’m going to work the next morning.” In Addition, platform architecture requiring caregivers to complete these logs changed caregivers’ relationship to time spent on the job. Francine described how filling out the notes, especially in the time-sensitive context of a shift, placed pressure on how she spent time providing care: “if you clock out right at a minute after [your shift ends] they get you on that.” Efforts to avoid disciplinary action created new relationships to time: “I just always try to clock out a few minutes before because you get all these questions before closing out the app” (Francine). In these cases, platform architecture changed caregivers' relationships with their time both on and off the clock,which put caregivers under additional pressure.We found that aspects of platform and algorithm design create new forms of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. We argue that this results from a mismatch between technologists’ moral reasoning and that of other platform actors. In addition, the need to fill open shifts and coordinate work across many individuals pri-oritizes a logic of efficiency over concerns for caregiver job quality.Despite coordinators’ unmet expectations and new pressures that the platform placed on caregivers, both sets of actors maintain a commitment to the platform.

58,Frustration,constrainsAgent,Coordinators,"The subject of our case study, CareTech4, is one of several start-upsthat are credited with “reinventing the [home care] agency model”[22]. Prior to data collection, CareTech acquired StayHome, a traditional home care agency franchise. To contextualize our findings,we briefly discuss CareTech’s business model.CareTech partners with traditional home care agencies to support back-end administrative, legal, compliance, and logistics functions in exchange for a share of partner agencies’ revenue, employing caregivers directly. Caregivers assist with activities of daily living(i.e., bathing, dressing, getting in or out of a bed or chair, walking,using the toilet, eating) [43], and instrumental activities of daily living (i.e., cooking, cleaning, transportation, laundry, managing finances) [46]. CareTech’s use of algorithms to match caregivers to care recipients is central to our case. When we started data collection, CareTech’s technology platform had recently been im-plemented at StayHome’s company-owned agencies, providing a unique opportunity to investigate care algorithm implementation.In this paper, we focus primarily on CareTech’s staffing prac-tices. CareTech uses metrics and algorithms, along with human management, to staff shifts. Staffing algorithms have a role at two main sites: as initial schedules were made and when other care-givers called off their shifts. When caregivers are scheduled during their onboarding, staff members at CareTech use algorithmic recommendation systems to match caregivers with care recipients. Evaluation metrics (i.e., timeliness, consistency, application usage,and call-offs), along with other data (e.g., caregiver commute time,number of complaints) are used to match caregivers and care recipients. Coordinators receive weekly surveys about the quality of care provided, and provide responses on a linear scale5. After IRB approval, we recruited participants—technologists (n =14), caregivers (n = 9), and coordinators (n = 7)—through a partnership with CareTech and StayHome for interviews using convenience and purposive sampling [10]. StayHome’s research staff arranged site visit and helped recruit participants. We provided a brief description of the study and a screening questionnaire distributed amongst the caregivers and coordinators over email. This approach provided an opportunity to learn from technologists, caregivers,coordinators who were enthusiastic about sharing their experi-ences with the platform. Table 2 and table 3 provide an overview of participant profiles.(1) Technologists: Technologists consisted of software engi-neers, designers, product managers, and data and opera-tions workers. Software engineers talked about buildingCareTech’s features and the company’s history. Designers Develop CareTech’s front-end user experience for caregivers.Designers, the operations team, and a product manager described how they approached curating the caregiver experi-ence. The data scientists, data analysts, and data stewards dis-cussed the metrics used to measure caregiver performance,the data that staffing algorithms use, and how algorithms work in practice.(2) Caregivers: We use the term ‘caregivers’ to refer to the people employed by CareTech to provide care for pay.(3) Coordinators: The term ‘coordinators’ refers to people that pay for CareTech’s services and coordinate their delivery,usually on behalf of an older loved one. Recruiting interview participants through a partnership with Stay-Home and CareTech potentially biased results toward more positive perspectives of organizational practices. Caregivers and coordina-tors with more negative views about the company may have been reluctant to share their opinions or participate in interviews alto-gether due to fears of retaliation from the platform. Convenience Sampling limited the extent to which we were able to understand differences across demographic subgroups. Future work should explore this issue. Further, recruitment overlooked the perspectives of care coordinators and caregivers who have left the platform due to difficulties This study draws on data gathered from one week of observations performed in July 2022 and 30 interviews conducted between May2022 and August 2022. We conducted in-depth interviews to understand the cultural inputs that shape algorithm design and the implications for caregivers and coordinators. Interviews are well-suited for understanding social dimensions of how people interpret the world and take actions based on those interpretations [64]. Interviews with technology workers show how they make sense of their work and build systems [67], and interviews with caregivers and coordinators show that care practices diverge from organizational philosophy [53]. After several interviews, one researcher visitedStayHome’s global headquarters and a company-owned agency,located in a major Midwestern city in the U.S. The researcher toured the company’s offices and met with support staff. In addition, theresearcher engaged these actors in informal conversations to learn how StayHome and CareTech operate. To understand how the plat-form is presented to caregivers and what aspects of paid care work are emphasized, the researcher observed a caregiver training ses-sion on lifting and transferring techniques at one of StayHome’scompany-owned franchises and attended a virtual onboarding ses-sion with CareTech in the afternoon.We developed the interview guide with interest in valuation and evaluation practices as they occur on CareTech’s platform. Treating valuation as a moral outlook, we drew on practice-oriented approaches to understanding how different actors conceptualize and contribute value in labor contexts [36]. Examining the practices of the people that develop platforms and those who are subject to their architecture provides an opportunity to identify the underlying justifications and actions that shape and transform care work as it occurs on the ground. Interview questions thus sought to elicit interviewees' daily practices, what elements of their work they described as most important, the least favorite aspects of their work,and their ideological orientation towards the concept of ‘care.’After obtaining consent, we recorded the interviews, which lasted between 45 and 90 minutes and took place mainly over Zoom. However, we did interview several caregivers and one coordinator in person. Team members iteratively refined these themes through discussion and mapped them to the EoW framework. We used a third-party qualitative coding tool (NVivo) to complete the coding process. To make theoretical sense of the data, we returned to the literature and iterated between data and extant research. Our findings indicate that technologists drew on several economies of worth—which we refer to as moral frameworks—to navigate the seemingly irreconcilable demands of home care. They referenced multiple interpretations of the term ‘care’ to resolve contradictions.We illustrate this point by first focusing on how technologists described the problems that they claim to solve. Then, we analyze the nature of the solutions they presented, highlighting how technolo-gists imbued different aspects of algorithm design and function with moral meanings. This finding demonstrates the interpretive flexibil-ity of technological artifacts. Finally, we turn to the perspectives of caregivers and coordinators. Their accounts show how algorithmic staffing practices created new forms of uncertainty—the mirror of technologists' stated intentions.4.1 Navigating Contextual ComplexityTechnologists drew on multiple moral frameworks to navigate expectations and demands, appealing to various interpretations of care’ to reconcile the contradictory pressures they face. The technologists we interviewed framed CareTech as a platform developed to address traditional home care agencies’ logistical and opera-tional challenges. In this context, they appealed to an industrial moral framework, framing their work as introducing greater levels of efficiency and rationalization to the home care industry. How-ever, many of the technologists we interviewed also framed their work in terms of a civic moral framework, critiquing prior staffing practices as subjective, opaque, unfair, and harmful to the material well-being of caregivers. Although these two narratives may appear contradictory, technologists unified these demands by appealing to the societal need for more care. For example, improvements inefficiency were discussed in terms of increasing the affordability of care while improving working conditions was imagined as growing the size of the caregiving workforce. We argue that technologists navigate complexity when creating and developing care algorithms by strategically appealing to justifications corresponding to differ-ent moral frameworks, drawing on multiple interpretations of a single term to move between them. Throughout this section, we draw attention to how technologists position algorithmic staffing practices as one solution to the problems they described.4.1.1 Platform Description & Motivations. The rhetoric that tech-nologists and company executives used to describe their motivation for building the platform appealed to domestic and social goods. In press releases and on the company website, CareTech’s execu-tives described their frustrations in searching for care for their own parents. Similarly, technologists invoked ideas of familial respon-sibility, relaying stories about their difficulties in finding care for aging parents. Technologists also drew on more civic-oriented no-tions of good, framing their work with reference to positive social change. For example, Richard described, “being part of something that can have a positive impact on society.” The company’s mission statement, was described as ‘improving care in society6, highlight-ing the significance of a single moral concept in technologists discourse.In discussing the company’s strategy, the technologists we in-terviewed described CareTech as a “platform,” “communication company,” or “logistical engine,”, foregrounding CareTech’s use of digital technology to improve efficiency, and framed their work asa response to logistical challenges in the home care industry. Aiden described what he framed as the company’s main value proposition:I think the big sort of sell is, it is getting harder and harder to operate care. I think it is getting more expensive...the core value proposition is where we are trying to figure out how to build a platform around doing this, and helping agencies focus more on their relationships with their communities and customers.He elaborated that, by centralizing operations, CareTech offers partner agencies relief from work that is “consuming and grueling,whether it’s paperwork, management, documentation, staffing, lo-gistics, or being on call all the time.” By filling this role, CareTech‘frees up agencies to both source customers and maintain that rela-tionship and kind of connection’ (Aiden). Repeated references to the relationship between CareTech and the agencies with which it partners serve two purposes. First, they identify areas whereCareTech uses technology to increase efficiency in the home care industry. This problem formulation provides the background for how organizational solutions are framed. Second, they format a division of labor. In this account, partner agencies are positioned as responsible for managing relationships in local markets, while the platform oversees aspects of labor control and management.Here, technologists frame the platform’s work in industrial terms and partner agencies in domestic terms. 4.1.2 Staffing Practices as Solutions. As they justified their work,technologists also blended elements from multiple moral frame-works. Specifically, they simultaneously appealed to notions of market dominance and civic responsibility. This overlap materialized as Robert, a data scientist, stated that the company’s scale offered a ‘unified view across markets’ and provided access to a sufficient amount of data to use statistical techniques to ‘learn from the data to provide better home care’, serving as a “competitive dif-ferentiator in the market.” In addition, Floyd framed the company's size as affording more ‘careful’ staffing practice:From a systemic perspective, when you are bigger you have these systems in place, and you do not have to guilt somebody into working a shift. If you need a shift filled, you have a stable of hundreds of caregivers you can reach out to, it is just a matter of how much bonus you have to put on it.These rhetorical strategies demonstrate how technologists draw on multiple moral frameworks to present their work as solutions to different problems.Building on discussions of CareTech’s organizational strategy,technologists most concretely articulated their efforts toward ‘im-proving care in society’ through labor management. They started these discussions by problematizing caregiver job quality under legacy home care practices as associated with low wages, few ben-efits, rigid scheduling practices, and little recognition of caregivers efforts. Kennedy critiqued legacy staffing practices on the grounds of fairness and transparency:There’s a lot of favoritism that happens. There’s a lack of transparency. And so as you can imagine, the caregivers who work the most shifts, they’re able to earn the most amount of money. And that’s really helping to improve their lives and livelihoods. Other technologists framed algorithmic staffing as a solution to the legacy staffing practices that Kennedy identified as opaque and unfair. While Kennedy incorporated concerns about material well-being into her critiques, other technologists generally avoided discussing their efforts toward increasing caregiver job quality in terms of a market-based moral framework. This may have resulted from the market constraints of care, where the price for private pay home care is inaccessible for many families. Aria explainedthat raising wages for caregivers would make the price of care“unpayable” by many clients. 4.1.3 Professionalizing Care. Instead, technologists framed their efforts as attempts to improve caregivers’ status and provide them with a career. Aria noted that improving the collective status of caregivers was part of CareTech’s mission since its founding, em-phasizing challenging aspects of the job:I think that a really big piece of what CareTech is try-ing to do and has been trying to do since the beginning you know, elevate the profession of caregiving. Andtruly treat it a profession instead of just a job...because it's a difficult, emotionally intense, sometimes physi-cally intense thing to do.Floyd described further aspirations to elevate caregivers’ status through professionalization:I would say that [career] is a north star for us. I think everyone views that as an innovation that we can and should make, and the profession is worth it... we're working towards it, but we haven’t actually gotten there yet.These discussions highlight the links that technologists establish between different moral frameworks as they respond to a complex set of challenges. While they expressed concern about the value that care holds in society, increasing the pecuniary value of car was viewed as infeasible. Technologists responded to this problem by appealing to the status of the profession. However, technologists most defined solutions came in the form of staffing algorithms.4.2 Datafying CareWe unpack staffing practices at CareTech, which we argue are emblematic of technological solutionism. Our analysis reveals that technologists associated different aspects of staffing algorithms with different moral frameworks. We argue that how decisions are made about who is best suited for particular shifts—and why—is changing with the advent and implementation of algorithmic staffing tools as technologists prioritize efficiency. However, discussions with technologists show that there are tensions present in the use of algorithms. On the one hand, technologists discussed their work in terms of trying to increase caregiver performance. Performance Evaluation metrics break care into a set of constituent elements closely aligned with operational efficiency (an appeal to the indus-trial moral framework). On the other hand, technologists described their work as oriented toward establishing long-term relationships between caregivers and care recipients (an appeal to the domestic moral framework).The metrics and measurements that support algorithmic staffing practices are most closely associated with notions of productivity and operational efficiency. Technologists presented one part of their work as oriented toward increasing the “performance, or perceived performance of the caregiver” (Floyd). They described how this work is accomplished by measuring: (1) timeliness (how frequently a caregiver arrives to a shift on time); (2) consistency (adherence to schedule shifts); (3) application usage (whether or not the caregiver uses the application to clock in to and out of shifts and evaluate care recipient well-being); and (4) call-offs (shifts not released seven days in advance). While this evaluation practice makes care legible based on a discrete set of metrics, the composition of these metrics is oriented toward operational efficiency rather than the experiences of care recipients or care coordinators.Technologists contrasted their work with platforms in the ride-hailing industry7, describing how their work was motivated by the desire to establish long-term relationships between caregivers and care recipients. They referenced algorithms in terms that framed care as a holistic practice, often comparing the product of their work to other intimate relationships. Staffing algorithms have a role at two main sites: as initial schedules were made and when other caregivers called off their shifts. When caregivers are scheduled during their onboarding, staff members at CareTech use algorithmic recommendation systems to match caregivers with care recipients.In both cases, platform architects compared the matching process to other intimate relations between caregivers and care recipients.In Sandra’s words: Once the data are all collected, [the algorithm] gives us a list of caregivers, and it was ranked by most likely to be picked up by the caregiver...there is a...I don't want to say negotiating, but there are conversations that go back and forth. Because it does become an arranged marriage when you’re putting it inside thehome.In instances where shifts opened up with clients, the platform gives caregivers the option to pick up shifts with these clients through a user interface that Floyd described as “not not tinder 8 inspired. In advancing these relationship-based arguments, technologists define quality care by referencing domestic relationships between caregivers and care recipients.On the one hand, technologists seek to build a platform that effi-ciently delivers consistent care to a growing number of older adult care recipients. On the other, they describe their work as motivated by a desire to optimize relationships between caregivers and care recipients. At the same time, they framed their efforts as improving fairness, accountability, and transparency in staffing practices. Pair-ing discussions of metrics—which break care down into constituent elements associated with industrial efficiency—with algorithms staffing practices—which technologists use to frame evaluation in domestic terms—reveals that these actors associate different parts of their job with distinct moral frameworks to meet a complex set of demands. Further, interviews with caregivers and coordinators reveal that these performance evaluation criteria and platform staffing practices are a source of tension and stress.4.3 Platform AsymmetriesWhat are the consequences of technologists’ actions? To answer this question, we turn to platform caregivers’ and care coordinators’ per-spectives and experiences. Contrary to technologists’ aspirations touse algorithms to build a fairer, more transparent order, algorithmic staffing practices in fact created new conditions of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. First, we focus on evaluation practices.CareTech’s app for caregivers displays ratings across several met-rics related to operational aspects of care delivery (i.e., timeliness,consistency, application usage, and call-offs). The platform also sends weekly caregiver evaluation surveys to coordinators but does not share this feedback directly with caregivers. Further, caregivers rarely received qualitative feedback regarding the quality of care they provided. Caregivers discussed how these aspects of platform design contributed to ambiguity regarding insight into their perfor-mance, while coordinators approached completing survey-based caregiver evaluations with ambivalence. Second, we analyze care-givers’ interactions with CareTech’s staffing practices. Caregivers described experiencing collapsed boundaries between working and personal time. Despite these new challenges, the caregivers and coordinators we interviewed did not mention a desire to leave. .4.3.1 Ambiguity and Ambivalence. While caregivers described providing care as meaningful and were generally content with the conditions they faced on the platform, they discussed a lack of clarity regarding expectations and performance. As Hayden said:I believe that the clients, they also rate us after every shift. So then if we get rated lowly every time or pretty consistently, I’m sure they will reach out tous...I don’t know that it helps us rate our care and how well we’re doing with our clients, but I don't know how else they could do that...you hear stories of people who are dissatisfied with their care, and that's hard to tell.It was only after connecting with other caregivers that Hayden Learned that it was possible to request a performance evaluation form CareTech. Further, the opacity of metrics created feelings of worry for care-givers about their performance. As a new caregiver on the platform,Hazel worried about a low client consistency rating and discussed needing to take the initiative to understand why she received low ratings across other metrics. Puzzled about low application usage ratings, Hazel described needing to reach out to CareTech to understand “what [she] was missing.” CareTech’s communication and evaluation practices created unclear situations with multiple interpretations and required additional labor on the part of caregivers to understand how care recipients experienced their care and how the platform judged their performance. Coordinators, on the other hand, discussed their own evaluation practices as infused with ambivalence—a finding that we found surprising given the intimate and impactful context of care for an older loved one. While coordinators described clear feelings about the care provided to loved ones, our interviewees responded to CareTech’s evaluation surveys inconsistently. Coordinators expressed satisfaction with the care that caregivers provided and thus did not feel a need to fill out the company’s weekly care-giver evaluation survey, described how these surveys were not as useful compared to in-person evaluations performed over more extended periods, or expressed that they did not feel their feedback through these outlets was listened to by CareTech. Phyllis—who lives with her care recipient—described that since the quality of care was so consistent, there was not a need to be very detailed in her evaluations: “they will send out those [surveys] weekly...soyou click on attentiveness, preparation, and I don’t remember what they all are. There’s about five of them. I don’t get very detailed.” On The other hand, Brooks—who did not live with his care recipient,and was dissatisfied with the consistency of staffing provided byCareTech—described feeling overwhelmed by the amount of eval-uating he was asked to do: “For each one of the caregivers that has been in, they’re asking for an opinion for eight to 10 caregivers everyMonday, on the same thing, the same people doing the same thing.I’ve had a hard time seeing the value on a weekly basis.” He saw more value in evaluations carried out over longer intervals as it had been before the acquisition. There used to be the quarterly report where they would actually go in and visit and come back and say,‘this has changed, or this looks like it’s changed’...when someone steps in four or five times a year those are the ones that can pick out some things.Opal, who uses CareTech to provide care to her husband, discussed her attitude towards the surveys: “Honestly, I ignore [the surveys]. It’s not something I want to do. I don’t know why. I know they're doing great.” These perspectives demonstrate a difference in the worth actors ascribed to particular evaluation practices, high-lighting a mismatch between technologists’, coordinators’, and care-givers’ perspectives. Other coordinators described non-use of CareTech’s evaluation infrastructure, even when there were striking departures from care expectations. Coordinators justified their approach by appealing to different moral frameworks. Riley said, “what did happen onetime, and I should probably be more tuned into it...there was one day when one of the caregivers didn’t show up at all. And I didn't know about it until the next day.” She justified the non-use through appeals to a domestic moral framework: “I’m not as hands-on, I’mnot looking at the app to see what they’re doing. I get my feedback on how they’re doing from my mom and dad.” Winnie, who relied on a caregiver to transport her mother to church on Sunday mornings, described situations where sometimes a caregiver assigned to the shift couldn’t drive or had no car. Even so, she did not fill out regular surveys, drawing on her experience as a business owner (industrial)to express that she understood the challenges of staffing shifts: “it’sa very hard thing to maneuver in the world that we’re walking in. We Own a small business. We employ 13 ladies, so I understand.” At the same time, she seemed to negatively moralize non-use: “I will be honest with you that a survey has come...I haven’t filled it out. So I Haven't done due diligence on my part. You know, so I’m going to own that part.” While some coordinators expressed frustration about consistency, communication, quality, and the efficacy of evaluation practices, they appealed to multiple moral frameworks to justify different uses of evaluation infrastructure.4.3.2 Work Practices and Professional Boundaries. Continued dis-cussion with caregivers provided insight into how the problems that technologists faced contributed to aspects of platform design.The need to fill open shifts and coordinate care work across multiple individuals—associated with an industrial moral framework—took precedence over other concerns.

It’s just a little harder to be either working or not working...when you see your phone in the morning and you see all those notifications there.Hayden described receiving “30 to 40” notifications a day from the app, even after reaching out to CareTech to express that they would not work any more shifts. Further, they described confu-sion and frustration regarding the processes by which shifts were initially assigned:I actually said no to [the shift], but they scheduled me anyway. Which was how I got a lot of my shifts,which was okay...I know sometimes it sounds weird,but I would say no to a shift, maybe they’d think thatI said yes.This account suggests that the platform does not allow for as much flexibility as technologists imagine.In contrast to legacy record-keeping procedures, where care-givers left paper-based care notes in clients’ homes, CareTech’splatform requires that caregivers describe their shifts upon clock-ing out in an electronic journal that is viewable by coordinators and other caregivers.

We provided a brief description of the study and a screening questionnaire distributed amongst the caregivers and coordinators over email. This approach provided an opportunity to learn from technologists, caregivers,coordinators who were enthusiastic about sharing their experi-ences with the platform. Table 2 and table 3 provide an overview of participant profiles.(1) Technologists: Technologists consisted of software engi-neers, designers, product managers, and data and opera-tions workers. Software engineers talked about buildingCareTech’s features and the company’s history. Designers Develop CareTech’s front-end user experience for caregivers.Designers, the operations team, and a product manager described how they approached curating the caregiver experi-ence. The data scientists, data analysts, and data stewards dis-cussed the metrics used to measure caregiver performance,the data that staffing algorithms use, and how algorithms work in practice.(2) Caregivers: We use the term ‘caregivers’ to refer to the people employed by CareTech to provide care for pay.(3) Coordinators: The term ‘coordinators’ refers to people that pay for CareTech’s services and coordinate their delivery,usually on behalf of an older loved one. Recruiting interview participants through a partnership with Stay-Home and CareTech potentially biased results toward more positive perspectives of organizational practices. Caregivers and coordina-tors with more negative views about the company may have been reluctant to share their opinions or participate in interviews alto-gether due to fears of retaliation from the platform. Convenience Sampling limited the extent to which we were able to understand differences across demographic subgroups. Future work should explore this issue. Further, recruitment overlooked the perspectives of care coordinators and caregivers who have left the platform due to difficulties This study draws on data gathered from one week of observations performed in July 2022 and 30 interviews conducted between May2022 and August 2022. We conducted in-depth interviews to understand the cultural inputs that shape algorithm design and the implications for caregivers and coordinators. Interviews are well-suited for understanding social dimensions of how people interpret the world and take actions based on those interpretations [64]. Interviews with technology workers show how they make sense of their work and build systems [67], and interviews with caregivers and coordinators show that care practices diverge from organizational philosophy [53]. After several interviews, one researcher visitedStayHome’s global headquarters and a company-owned agency,located in a major Midwestern city in the U.S. The researcher toured the company’s offices and met with support staff. In addition, theresearcher engaged these actors in informal conversations to learn how StayHome and CareTech operate. To understand how the plat-form is presented to caregivers and what aspects of paid care work are emphasized, the researcher observed a caregiver training ses-sion on lifting and transferring techniques at one of StayHome’scompany-owned franchises and attended a virtual onboarding ses-sion with CareTech in the afternoon.We developed the interview guide with interest in valuation and evaluation practices as they occur on CareTech’s platform. Treating valuation as a moral outlook, we drew on practice-oriented approaches to understanding how different actors conceptualize and contribute value in labor contexts [36]. Examining the practices of the people that develop platforms and those who are subject to their architecture provides an opportunity to identify the underlying justifications and actions that shape and transform care work as it occurs on the ground. Interview questions thus sought to elicit interviewees' daily practices, what elements of their work they described as most important, the least favorite aspects of their work,and their ideological orientation towards the concept of ‘care.’After obtaining consent, we recorded the interviews, which lasted between 45 and 90 minutes and took place mainly over Zoom. However, we did interview several caregivers and one coordinator in person. Team members iteratively refined these themes through discussion and mapped them to the EoW framework. We used a third-party qualitative coding tool (NVivo) to complete the coding process. To make theoretical sense of the data, we returned to the literature and iterated between data and extant research. Our findings indicate that technologists drew on several economies of worth—which we refer to as moral frameworks—to navigate the seemingly irreconcilable demands of home care. They referenced multiple interpretations of the term ‘care’ to resolve contradictions.We illustrate this point by first focusing on how technologists described the problems that they claim to solve. Then, we analyze the nature of the solutions they presented, highlighting how technolo-gists imbued different aspects of algorithm design and function with moral meanings. This finding demonstrates the interpretive flexibil-ity of technological artifacts. Finally, we turn to the perspectives of caregivers and coordinators. Their accounts show how algorithmic staffing practices created new forms of uncertainty—the mirror of technologists' stated intentions.4.1 Navigating Contextual ComplexityTechnologists drew on multiple moral frameworks to navigate expectations and demands, appealing to various interpretations of care’ to reconcile the contradictory pressures they face. The technologists we interviewed framed CareTech as a platform developed to address traditional home care agencies’ logistical and opera-tional challenges. In this context, they appealed to an industrial moral framework, framing their work as introducing greater levels of efficiency and rationalization to the home care industry. How-ever, many of the technologists we interviewed also framed their work in terms of a civic moral framework, critiquing prior staffing practices as subjective, opaque, unfair, and harmful to the material well-being of caregivers. Although these two narratives may appear contradictory, technologists unified these demands by appealing to the societal need for more care. For example, improvements inefficiency were discussed in terms of increasing the affordability of care while improving working conditions was imagined as growing the size of the caregiving workforce. We argue that technologists navigate complexity when creating and developing care algorithms by strategically appealing to justifications corresponding to differ-ent moral frameworks, drawing on multiple interpretations of a single term to move between them. Throughout this section, we draw attention to how technologists position algorithmic staffing practices as one solution to the problems they described.4.1.1 Platform Description & Motivations. The rhetoric that tech-nologists and company executives used to describe their motivation for building the platform appealed to domestic and social goods. In press releases and on the company website, CareTech’s execu-tives described their frustrations in searching for care for their own parents. Similarly, technologists invoked ideas of familial respon-sibility, relaying stories about their difficulties in finding care for aging parents. Technologists also drew on more civic-oriented no-tions of good, framing their work with reference to positive social change. For example, Richard described, “being part of something that can have a positive impact on society.” The company’s mission statement, was described as ‘improving care in society6, highlight-ing the significance of a single moral concept in technologists discourse.In discussing the company’s strategy, the technologists we in-terviewed described CareTech as a “platform,” “communication company,” or “logistical engine,”, foregrounding CareTech’s use of digital technology to improve efficiency, and framed their work asa response to logistical challenges in the home care industry. Aiden described what he framed as the company’s main value proposition:I think the big sort of sell is, it is getting harder and harder to operate care. I think it is getting more expensive...the core value proposition is where we are trying to figure out how to build a platform around doing this, and helping agencies focus more on their relationships with their communities and customers.He elaborated that, by centralizing operations, CareTech offers partner agencies relief from work that is “consuming and grueling,whether it’s paperwork, management, documentation, staffing, lo-gistics, or being on call all the time.” By filling this role, CareTech‘frees up agencies to both source customers and maintain that rela-tionship and kind of connection’ (Aiden). Repeated references to the relationship between CareTech and the agencies with which it partners serve two purposes. First, they identify areas whereCareTech uses technology to increase efficiency in the home care industry. This problem formulation provides the background for how organizational solutions are framed. Second, they format a division of labor. In this account, partner agencies are positioned as responsible for managing relationships in local markets, while the platform oversees aspects of labor control and management.Here, technologists frame the platform’s work in industrial terms and partner agencies in domestic terms. 4.1.2 Staffing Practices as Solutions. As they justified their work,technologists also blended elements from multiple moral frame-works. Specifically, they simultaneously appealed to notions of market dominance and civic responsibility. This overlap materialized as Robert, a data scientist, stated that the company’s scale offered a ‘unified view across markets’ and provided access to a sufficient amount of data to use statistical techniques to ‘learn from the data to provide better home care’, serving as a “competitive dif-ferentiator in the market.” In addition, Floyd framed the company's size as affording more ‘careful’ staffing practice:From a systemic perspective, when you are bigger you have these systems in place, and you do not have to guilt somebody into working a shift. If you need a shift filled, you have a stable of hundreds of caregivers you can reach out to, it is just a matter of how much bonus you have to put on it.These rhetorical strategies demonstrate how technologists draw on multiple moral frameworks to present their work as solutions to different problems.Building on discussions of CareTech’s organizational strategy,technologists most concretely articulated their efforts toward ‘im-proving care in society’ through labor management. They started these discussions by problematizing caregiver job quality under legacy home care practices as associated with low wages, few ben-efits, rigid scheduling practices, and little recognition of caregivers efforts. Kennedy critiqued legacy staffing practices on the grounds of fairness and transparency:There’s a lot of favoritism that happens. There’s a lack of transparency. And so as you can imagine, the caregivers who work the most shifts, they’re able to earn the most amount of money. And that’s really helping to improve their lives and livelihoods. Other technologists framed algorithmic staffing as a solution to the legacy staffing practices that Kennedy identified as opaque and unfair. While Kennedy incorporated concerns about material well-being into her critiques, other technologists generally avoided discussing their efforts toward increasing caregiver job quality in terms of a market-based moral framework. This may have resulted from the market constraints of care, where the price for private pay home care is inaccessible for many families. Aria explainedthat raising wages for caregivers would make the price of care“unpayable” by many clients. 4.1.3 Professionalizing Care. Instead, technologists framed their efforts as attempts to improve caregivers’ status and provide them with a career. Aria noted that improving the collective status of caregivers was part of CareTech’s mission since its founding, em-phasizing challenging aspects of the job:I think that a really big piece of what CareTech is try-ing to do and has been trying to do since the beginning you know, elevate the profession of caregiving. Andtruly treat it a profession instead of just a job...because it's a difficult, emotionally intense, sometimes physi-cally intense thing to do.Floyd described further aspirations to elevate caregivers’ status through professionalization:I would say that [career] is a north star for us. I think everyone views that as an innovation that we can and should make, and the profession is worth it... we're working towards it, but we haven’t actually gotten there yet.These discussions highlight the links that technologists establish between different moral frameworks as they respond to a complex set of challenges. While they expressed concern about the value that care holds in society, increasing the pecuniary value of car was viewed as infeasible. Technologists responded to this problem by appealing to the status of the profession. However, technologists most defined solutions came in the form of staffing algorithms.4.2 Datafying CareWe unpack staffing practices at CareTech, which we argue are emblematic of technological solutionism. Our analysis reveals that technologists associated different aspects of staffing algorithms with different moral frameworks. We argue that how decisions are made about who is best suited for particular shifts—and why—is changing with the advent and implementation of algorithmic staffing tools as technologists prioritize efficiency. However, discussions with technologists show that there are tensions present in the use of algorithms. On the one hand, technologists discussed their work in terms of trying to increase caregiver performance. Performance Evaluation metrics break care into a set of constituent elements closely aligned with operational efficiency (an appeal to the indus-trial moral framework). On the other hand, technologists described their work as oriented toward establishing long-term relationships between caregivers and care recipients (an appeal to the domestic moral framework).The metrics and measurements that support algorithmic staffing practices are most closely associated with notions of productivity and operational efficiency. Technologists presented one part of their work as oriented toward increasing the “performance, or perceived performance of the caregiver” (Floyd). They described how this work is accomplished by measuring: (1) timeliness (how frequently a caregiver arrives to a shift on time); (2) consistency (adherence to schedule shifts); (3) application usage (whether or not the caregiver uses the application to clock in to and out of shifts and evaluate care recipient well-being); and (4) call-offs (shifts not released seven days in advance). While this evaluation practice makes care legible based on a discrete set of metrics, the composition of these metrics is oriented toward operational efficiency rather than the experiences of care recipients or care coordinators.Technologists contrasted their work with platforms in the ride-hailing industry7, describing how their work was motivated by the desire to establish long-term relationships between caregivers and care recipients. They referenced algorithms in terms that framed care as a holistic practice, often comparing the product of their work to other intimate relationships. Staffing algorithms have a role at two main sites: as initial schedules were made and when other caregivers called off their shifts. When caregivers are scheduled during their onboarding, staff members at CareTech use algorithmic recommendation systems to match caregivers with care recipients.In both cases, platform architects compared the matching process to other intimate relations between caregivers and care recipients.In Sandra’s words: Once the data are all collected, [the algorithm] gives us a list of caregivers, and it was ranked by most likely to be picked up by the caregiver...there is a...I don't want to say negotiating, but there are conversations that go back and forth. Because it does become an arranged marriage when you’re putting it inside thehome.In instances where shifts opened up with clients, the platform gives caregivers the option to pick up shifts with these clients through a user interface that Floyd described as “not not tinder 8 inspired. In advancing these relationship-based arguments, technologists define quality care by referencing domestic relationships between caregivers and care recipients.On the one hand, technologists seek to build a platform that effi-ciently delivers consistent care to a growing number of older adult care recipients. On the other, they describe their work as motivated by a desire to optimize relationships between caregivers and care recipients. At the same time, they framed their efforts as improving fairness, accountability, and transparency in staffing practices. Pair-ing discussions of metrics—which break care down into constituent elements associated with industrial efficiency—with algorithms staffing practices—which technologists use to frame evaluation in domestic terms—reveals that these actors associate different parts of their job with distinct moral frameworks to meet a complex set of demands. Further, interviews with caregivers and coordinators reveal that these performance evaluation criteria and platform staffing practices are a source of tension and stress.4.3 Platform AsymmetriesWhat are the consequences of technologists’ actions? To answer this question, we turn to platform caregivers’ and care coordinators’ per-spectives and experiences. Contrary to technologists’ aspirations touse algorithms to build a fairer, more transparent order, algorithmic staffing practices in fact created new conditions of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. First, we focus on evaluation practices.CareTech’s app for caregivers displays ratings across several met-rics related to operational aspects of care delivery (i.e., timeliness,consistency, application usage, and call-offs). The platform also sends weekly caregiver evaluation surveys to coordinators but does not share this feedback directly with caregivers. Further, caregivers rarely received qualitative feedback regarding the quality of care they provided. Caregivers discussed how these aspects of platform design contributed to ambiguity regarding insight into their perfor-mance, while coordinators approached completing survey-based caregiver evaluations with ambivalence. Second, we analyze care-givers’ interactions with CareTech’s staffing practices. Caregivers described experiencing collapsed boundaries between working and personal time. Despite these new challenges, the caregivers and coordinators we interviewed did not mention a desire to leave. .4.3.1 Ambiguity and Ambivalence. While caregivers described providing care as meaningful and were generally content with the conditions they faced on the platform, they discussed a lack of clarity regarding expectations and performance. As Hayden said:I believe that the clients, they also rate us after every shift. So then if we get rated lowly every time or pretty consistently, I’m sure they will reach out tous...I don’t know that it helps us rate our care and how well we’re doing with our clients, but I don't know how else they could do that...you hear stories of people who are dissatisfied with their care, and that's hard to tell.It was only after connecting with other caregivers that Hayden Learned that it was possible to request a performance evaluation form CareTech. Further, the opacity of metrics created feelings of worry for care-givers about their performance. As a new caregiver on the platform,Hazel worried about a low client consistency rating and discussed needing to take the initiative to understand why she received low ratings across other metrics. Puzzled about low application usage ratings, Hazel described needing to reach out to CareTech to understand “what [she] was missing.” CareTech’s communication and evaluation practices created unclear situations with multiple interpretations and required additional labor on the part of caregivers to understand how care recipients experienced their care and how the platform judged their performance. Coordinators, on the other hand, discussed their own evaluation practices as infused with ambivalence—a finding that we found surprising given the intimate and impactful context of care for an older loved one. While coordinators described clear feelings about the care provided to loved ones, our interviewees responded to CareTech’s evaluation surveys inconsistently. Coordinators expressed satisfaction with the care that caregivers provided and thus did not feel a need to fill out the company’s weekly care-giver evaluation survey, described how these surveys were not as useful compared to in-person evaluations performed over more extended periods, or expressed that they did not feel their feedback through these outlets was listened to by CareTech. Phyllis—who lives with her care recipient—described that since the quality of care was so consistent, there was not a need to be very detailed in her evaluations: “they will send out those [surveys] weekly...soyou click on attentiveness, preparation, and I don’t remember what they all are. There’s about five of them. I don’t get very detailed.” On The other hand, Brooks—who did not live with his care recipient,and was dissatisfied with the consistency of staffing provided byCareTech—described feeling overwhelmed by the amount of eval-uating he was asked to do: “For each one of the caregivers that has been in, they’re asking for an opinion for eight to 10 caregivers everyMonday, on the same thing, the same people doing the same thing.I’ve had a hard time seeing the value on a weekly basis.” He saw more value in evaluations carried out over longer intervals as it had been before the acquisition. There used to be the quarterly report where they would actually go in and visit and come back and say,‘this has changed, or this looks like it’s changed’...when someone steps in four or five times a year those are the ones that can pick out some things.Opal, who uses CareTech to provide care to her husband, discussed her attitude towards the surveys: “Honestly, I ignore [the surveys]. It’s not something I want to do. I don’t know why. I know they're doing great.” These perspectives demonstrate a difference in the worth actors ascribed to particular evaluation practices, high-lighting a mismatch between technologists’, coordinators’, and care-givers’ perspectives. Other coordinators described non-use of CareTech’s evaluation infrastructure, even when there were striking departures from care expectations. Coordinators justified their approach by appealing to different moral frameworks. Riley said, “what did happen onetime, and I should probably be more tuned into it...there was one day when one of the caregivers didn’t show up at all. And I didn't know about it until the next day.” She justified the non-use through appeals to a domestic moral framework: “I’m not as hands-on, I’mnot looking at the app to see what they’re doing. I get my feedback on how they’re doing from my mom and dad.” Winnie, who relied on a caregiver to transport her mother to church on Sunday mornings, described situations where sometimes a caregiver assigned to the shift couldn’t drive or had no car. Even so, she did not fill out regular surveys, drawing on her experience as a business owner (industrial)to express that she understood the challenges of staffing shifts: “it’sa very hard thing to maneuver in the world that we’re walking in. We Own a small business. We employ 13 ladies, so I understand.” At the same time, she seemed to negatively moralize non-use: “I will be honest with you that a survey has come...I haven’t filled it out. So I Haven't done due diligence on my part. You know, so I’m going to own that part.” While some coordinators expressed frustration about consistency, communication, quality, and the efficacy of evaluation practices, they appealed to multiple moral frameworks to justify different uses of evaluation infrastructure.4.3.2 Work Practices and Professional Boundaries. Continued dis-cussion with caregivers provided insight into how the problems that technologists faced contributed to aspects of platform design.The need to fill open shifts and coordinate care work across multiple individuals—associated with an industrial moral framework—took precedence over other concerns. Francine’s account of interactions with CareTech provides an example of how the need to staff shifts devalued communication about performance: “they have never given me any feedback or evaluation, the only time they call is about the schedule, asking if you can work more.” We argue that technologists prioritization of needs associated with the industrial moral frame-work eroded the boundary between caregivers’ work and personal lives and changed care practices.For example, the platform uses a notification system to bring open shifts to caregivers’ attention. However, Pepper describe how the constant notification stream makes it difficult for her to differentiate between work and leisure time:I can tell they have a lot of shifts to fill in. Am I go-ing to be under pressure? They’ve asked me for five things, and you said no to all of them, it feels likeI should say yes to something now. It’s just a little harder to be either working or not working...when you see your phone in the morning and you see all those notifications there.Hayden described receiving “30 to 40” notifications a day from the app, even after reaching out to CareTech to express that they would not work any more shifts. Further, they described confu-sion and frustration regarding the processes by which shifts were initially assigned:I actually said no to [the shift], but they scheduled me anyway. Which was how I got a lot of my shifts,which was okay...I know sometimes it sounds weird,but I would say no to a shift, maybe they’d think thatI said yes.This account suggests that the platform does not allow for as much flexibility as technologists imagine.In contrast to legacy record-keeping procedures, where care-givers left paper-based care notes in clients’ homes, CareTech’splatform requires that caregivers describe their shifts upon clock-ing out in an electronic journal that is viewable by coordinators and other caregivers. While caregivers described that the journal helped them feel more prepared for each shift, they also described reading journal entries outside of working hours, which provided further evidence for blurred boundaries between work and personal life.For example, Chauncey described reading entries “at night, before Igo to bed, I start reading if I’m going to work the next morning.” In Addition, platform architecture requiring caregivers to complete these logs changed caregivers’ relationship to time spent on the job. Francine described how filling out the notes, especially in the time-sensitive context of a shift, placed pressure on how she spent time providing care: “if you clock out right at a minute after [your shift ends] they get you on that.” Efforts to avoid disciplinary action created new relationships to time: “I just always try to clock out a few minutes before because you get all these questions before closing out the app” (Francine). In these cases, platform architecture changed caregivers' relationships with their time both on and off the clock,which put caregivers under additional pressure.We found that aspects of platform and algorithm design create new forms of uncertainty for caregivers and coordinators. We argue that this results from a mismatch between technologists’ moral reasoning and that of other platform actors. In addition, the need to fill open shifts and coordinate work across many individuals pri-oritizes a logic of efficiency over concerns for caregiver job quality.Despite coordinators’ unmet expectations and new pressures that the platform placed on caregivers, both sets of actors maintain a commitment to the platform. A possible explanation for contin-ued attachment is the moral significance of ‘care.’ While the term carries various meanings across actors and situations, it may act as a resource that maintains a particular status quo by mitigating organized critique of or departure from the platform. ","629-30, 631-4",We argue that technologists prioritization of needs associated with the industrial moral framework eroded the boundary between caregivers’ work and personal lives and changed care practices.
