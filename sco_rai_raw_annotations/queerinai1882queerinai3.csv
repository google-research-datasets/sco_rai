9,CirculationOfPreviousName,Perceived_Problem,"For many transgender, non-binary, and gender-diverse scholars(as well as others), the continued circulation of a previous name in publishing is a significant source of trauma [122]. Referring to an author by a previous name without consent (deadnaming) may effectively out their identity against their will. Queer in AI has worked along with the Name Change Policy Working Group [89]to advocate name change policies in AI venues, helping to establish the name-change policies and procedures now adopted by mostAI-related venues [5, 6, 14, 15, 62, 78, 90, 123] (cf. Appendix § C for more about Queer in AI’s advocacy and impact). Even publishers with functional name change policies are often woefully slow to implement them, and search engines can index outdated information long after its correction [115, 116]; moreover,authors often use outdated bibliographic entries long after relevant publications and search tools have been updated [120]. It is thus vital to check the correctness of citations in submitted papers to avoid propagating incorrect information. QueerInAI has thus devel-oped a tool to check paper PDFs for mistaken citations. It searches the ACL Anthology, DBLP, and arXiv for a close paper title match,and prompts a correction if the paper’s author list disagrees with that source, detecting both deadnaming and incomplete or outdated author lists. DBLP in particular provides better name change sup-port than many other platforms, via ORCID [93]. This toolkit has been integrated into ACL publication camera-ready systems [98],and Queer in AI hopes to expand it to other conferences. A demo is available at qinai-name-check.streamlite.app. Additionally, Queer in AI advocates publishers to promptly grant name correction requests in any format, without unnecessary barriers or documentation requirements. Such changes should remove all instances of authors’ previous names from all records, or (at the author’s discretion) add disclaimers for media that cannot be updated (e.g., audio or video recordings). As the result of this ad-vocacy, Queer in AI has helped institute effective name-change processes at NAACL and EMNLP; and has worked with the Association for Computational Linguistics [49] to implement a name change process, proactive measures to prevent the deadnaming trans authors, and protocols to handle authors’ requests to keep their videos private.

Queer in AI has worked along with the Name Change Policy Working Group [89]to advocate name change policies in AI venues, helping to establish the name-change policies and procedures now adopted by mostAI-related venues [5, 6, 14, 15, 62, 78, 90, 123] (cf. Appendix § C for more about Queer in AI’s advocacy and impact). Even publishers with functional name change policies are often woefully slow to implement them, and search engines can index outdated information long after its correction [115, 116]; moreover,authors often use outdated bibliographic entries long after relevant publications and search tools have been updated [120]. It is thus vital to check the correctness of citations in submitted papers to avoid propagating incorrect information. QueerInAI has thus devel-oped a tool to check paper PDFs for mistaken citations. It searches the ACL Anthology, DBLP, and arXiv for a close paper title match,and prompts a correction if the paper’s author list disagrees with that source, detecting both deadnaming and incomplete or outdated author lists. DBLP in particular provides better name change sup-port than many other platforms, via ORCID [93]. This toolkit has been integrated into ACL publication camera-ready systems [98],and Queer in AI hopes to expand it to other conferences. A demo is available at qinai-name-check.streamlite.app. Additionally, Queer in AI advocates publishers to promptly grant name correction requests in any format, without unnecessary barriers or documentation requirements. Such changes should remove all instances of authors’ previous names from all records, or (at the author’s discretion) add disclaimers for media that cannot be updated (e.g., audio or video recordings). As the result of this ad-vocacy, Queer in AI has helped institute effective name-change processes at NAACL and EMNLP; and has worked with the Association for Computational Linguistics [49] to implement a name change process, proactive measures to prevent the deadnaming trans authors, and protocols to handle authors’ requests to keep their videos private. ",1890-1,QueerInAI has thus developed a tool to check paper PDFs for mistaken citations.
