9,LackOfBenefits,Perceived_Problem,"Increasing adoption of online commerce has created income op-portunities for millions of delivery drivers who deliver items, from clothes and smartphones to foods and medicines, to customers. Despite their indispensability for the ecosystem, the drivers are often deprived of employment benefits and their earnings are tied to the number of successful deliveries, forcing them to go on repeated strikes to demand fair wage. In addition to low wages, there is considerable variability in driver incomes. One major component contributing to this variability is the static assignment of drivers to delivery zones as different zones likely have different workloads and hence earning opportunities. To reduce this variability, we directly engage with the gig delivery drivers to understand their perspectives on fair income distribution, and incorporate the same by proposing FairAssign for dynamic assignment of drivers to delivery zones to ensure fair distribution of earning opportunities.Specifically, we introduce a framework for stochastic pairwise fairness where, based on a similarity measure between the drivers,individual drivers are assigned to probability distributions over dif-ferent zones such that similar individuals are mapped to statistically similar distributions. To realize these distributions, we develop a randomized dependent rounding based efficient sampling algorithm such that the workload constraints in each zone are satisfied, and the expected travel cost is minimized. Extensive experiments on real-world food delivery data and semi-synthetic ecommerce data show the efficacy of FairAssign over other baselines. [...] In a marked departure from prior works on fair food delivery,we engage with the concerned stakeholders by conducting semi-structured interviews with the delivery drivers.Interview Setup. We conducted in-person interviews with 30 drivers in two metro cities in India – all of them are men in their 20s and 30s – and most of them (28) are working with different food-delivery platforms. The remaining two drivers were working with a quick commerce platform. The purpose of the interviews was to know the current state of gig delivery, existence of zoning and their opinions about what would constitute a fair distribution of income opportunities. We approached the drivers when they were returning after completing deliveries in different localities, so as to not disturb their regular operations. We informed them about the purpose and requested them for a 10 minutes interview. Weonly proceeded with the interviews after getting informed verbal consent and we compensated their time with INR 100 which is roughly equal to their average earning per delivery (and much higher than the legal minimum wage, considering the interview duration [45]).Key Findings. The interviews were semi-structured where we focused on eliciting narratives from the participants regarding their experiences. All of the participants reported being asked to select an available “zone” of their choice while onboarding a platform,and thereafter they could only log into the platform and pick up orders in the assigned zone. Most of the participants chose the zone closest to their residence, while a few chose a zone with more familiar restaurants. They complained about not getting orders on the way back when they deliver to customers outside their zone.Their claims can be further corroborated by screenshots posted by drivers working elsewhere (see Fig. 1).On income disparity, they were unsure about the order volumes in father zones; however, the majority of the drivers felt that other nearby zones with more restaurants should have higher frequency of orders. They mentioned that it is technically possible to change zones, provided there is a valid reason and “vacancy"" in the desired zone, though the zone change requests are often turned down by the platforms. Concerning dynamic zone assignment, 26 out of 30 drivers had no objections as long as the zones were not too faraway from their residence and the platform pays for traveling to the assigned zone, as they are already accustomed to delivering to customers in different zones.6 Four drivers were hesitant, as they feared that they might lose some orders while getting accustomed to new neighborhoods. Most of the drivers desired the fluidity towards seamless operation in multiple nearby zones which they feel would give them better income opportunities. However, prior information about the assigned zone before the start of a workday was deemed crucial by the drivers. They reported receiving a rating for most of the deliveries and observed that higher ratings increase the likelihood of getting more orders.Ethical Considerations. We approached the participants with great care, not to disturb them during their jobs or when they were on move. We also reflected upon whether the questionnaire cause any mental harm. To our delight, multiple participants expressed happiness to help us as they felt empowered by being heard. Wealso made sure not to prime them through our questions and let the conversations free flowing. We did not record any personally identifiable information about the participants and securely stored the transcripts. We did not reveal the platform and the city names to preserve anonymity.","753, 755","deprived of employment benefits and their earnings are tied to the number of successful deliveries,",

17,FairnessFramework,Artifact,"Increasing adoption of online commerce has created income op-portunities for millions of delivery drivers who deliver items, from clothes and smartphones to foods and medicines, to customers. Despite their indispensability for the ecosystem, the drivers are often deprived of employment benefits and their earnings are tied to the number of successful deliveries, forcing them to go on repeated strikes to demand fair wage. In addition to low wages, there is considerable variability in driver incomes. One major component contributing to this variability is the static assignment of drivers to delivery zones as different zones likely have different workloads and hence earning opportunities. To reduce this variability, we directly engage with the gig delivery drivers to understand their perspectives on fair income distribution, and incorporate the same by proposing FairAssign for dynamic assignment of drivers to delivery zones to ensure fair distribution of earning opportunities.Specifically, we introduce a framework for stochastic pairwise fairness where, based on a similarity measure between the drivers,individual drivers are assigned to probability distributions over dif-ferent zones such that similar individuals are mapped to statistically similar distributions. To realize these distributions, we develop a randomized dependent rounding based efficient sampling algorithm such that the workload constraints in each zone are satisfied, and the expected travel cost is minimized. Extensive experiments on real-world food delivery data and semi-synthetic ecommerce data show the efficacy of FairAssign over other baselines. [...] In a marked departure from prior works on fair food delivery,we engage with the concerned stakeholders by conducting semi-structured interviews with the delivery drivers.Interview Setup. We conducted in-person interviews with 30 drivers in two metro cities in India – all of them are men in their 20s and 30s – and most of them (28) are working with different food-delivery platforms. The remaining two drivers were working with a quick commerce platform. The purpose of the interviews was to know the current state of gig delivery, existence of zoning and their opinions about what would constitute a fair distribution of income opportunities. We approached the drivers when they were returning after completing deliveries in different localities, so as to not disturb their regular operations. We informed them about the purpose and requested them for a 10 minutes interview. Weonly proceeded with the interviews after getting informed verbal consent and we compensated their time with INR 100 which is roughly equal to their average earning per delivery (and much higher than the legal minimum wage, considering the interview duration [45]).Key Findings.

We informed them about the purpose and requested them for a 10 minutes interview. Weonly proceeded with the interviews after getting informed verbal consent and we compensated their time with INR 100 which is roughly equal to their average earning per delivery (and much higher than the legal minimum wage, considering the interview duration [45]).Key Findings. The interviews were semi-structured where we focused on eliciting narratives from the participants regarding their experiences. All of the participants reported being asked to select an available “zone” of their choice while onboarding a platform,and thereafter they could only log into the platform and pick up orders in the assigned zone. Most of the participants chose the zone closest to their residence, while a few chose a zone with more familiar restaurants. They complained about not getting orders on the way back when they deliver to customers outside their zone.Their claims can be further corroborated by screenshots posted by drivers working elsewhere (see Fig. 1).On income disparity, they were unsure about the order volumes in father zones; however, the majority of the drivers felt that other nearby zones with more restaurants should have higher frequency of orders. They mentioned that it is technically possible to change zones, provided there is a valid reason and “vacancy"" in the desired zone, though the zone change requests are often turned down by the platforms. Concerning dynamic zone assignment, 26 out of 30 drivers had no objections as long as the zones were not too faraway from their residence and the platform pays for traveling to the assigned zone, as they are already accustomed to delivering to customers in different zones.6 Four drivers were hesitant, as they feared that they might lose some orders while getting accustomed to new neighborhoods. Most of the drivers desired the fluidity towards seamless operation in multiple nearby zones which they feel would give them better income opportunities. However, prior information about the assigned zone before the start of a workday was deemed crucial by the drivers. They reported receiving a rating for most of the deliveries and observed that higher ratings increase the likelihood of getting more orders.Ethical Considerations. We approached the participants with great care, not to disturb them during their jobs or when they were on move. We also reflected upon whether the questionnaire cause any mental harm. To our delight, multiple participants expressed happiness to help us as they felt empowered by being heard. Wealso made sure not to prime them through our questions and let the conversations free flowing.

28,Hesitancy,constrainsAgent,Drivers,"Increasing adoption of online commerce has created income op-portunities for millions of delivery drivers who deliver items, from clothes and smartphones to foods and medicines, to customers. Despite their indispensability for the ecosystem, the drivers are often deprived of employment benefits and their earnings are tied to the number of successful deliveries, forcing them to go on repeated strikes to demand fair wage. In addition to low wages, there is considerable variability in driver incomes. One major component contributing to this variability is the static assignment of drivers to delivery zones as different zones likely have different workloads and hence earning opportunities. To reduce this variability, we directly engage with the gig delivery drivers to understand their perspectives on fair income distribution, and incorporate the same by proposing FairAssign for dynamic assignment of drivers to delivery zones to ensure fair distribution of earning opportunities.Specifically, we introduce a framework for stochastic pairwise fairness where, based on a similarity measure between the drivers,individual drivers are assigned to probability distributions over dif-ferent zones such that similar individuals are mapped to statistically similar distributions. To realize these distributions, we develop a randomized dependent rounding based efficient sampling algorithm such that the workload constraints in each zone are satisfied, and the expected travel cost is minimized. Extensive experiments on real-world food delivery data and semi-synthetic ecommerce data show the efficacy of FairAssign over other baselines. [...] In a marked departure from prior works on fair food delivery,we engage with the concerned stakeholders by conducting semi-structured interviews with the delivery drivers.Interview Setup. We conducted in-person interviews with 30 drivers in two metro cities in India – all of them are men in their 20s and 30s – and most of them (28) are working with different food-delivery platforms.
