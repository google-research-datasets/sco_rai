9,QueerScientists,Agent,"Queer folks report a lack of community and queer role models due to the underrepresentation of senior queer folks in academia. Thus,supporting queer and low-income scholars financially helps bring more marginalized voices into STEM academia, creating more op-portunities for participatory research and technology design. To Address this, Queer in AI launched the Graduate School Applica-tion Fee Aid Program to improve queer representation and make graduate programs accessible.4.1.1 Financial challenges. The costs for graduate school applica-tions prevent many low-income and international scientists from accessing graduate programs, well before they can benefit from many of the fellowships and need-based scholarships intended to address exclusion. This process is costly: between the application fees (∼$50–$150 USD per program in North America and parts ofEurope), costs of required tests (e.g. GRE), test results and tran-script delivery fees, and test preparation expenses, one round of applications can easily amount to over $1,000 USD. Internationalapplicants may be further required to pay for language proficiency tests (e.g. TOEFL), translation services, and third-party credentials vetting. Although some schools offer fee waivers, they vary widely from school to school, are often very limited in applicability, and can require onerous documentation.The majority of applicants apply to North American schools.This is likely caused by the cultural dominance of Anglo-American Schools in the AI/ML space and the common practice of requiring extensive standardized tests and application fees at these schools.Standardized tests like the GRE claim to level the playing field for applicants, they institute barriers to individuals from the GlobalSouth and reify colonialism under a veneer of fairness. Addition-ally, fees make these exams wholly inaccessible to many in theGlobal South: the GRE costs three times the average monthly salary in Ethiopia [11]. Data collected from Queer in AI’s surveys have been used to argue that departments should eliminate the GRE and application fees.These financial challenges are particularly likely to be insur-mountable for queer scientists, who may be cut off from familial financial support, might pay out of pocket for gender-affirming healthcare, and often incur additional expenses managing oppres-sion and trauma. Queer people thus suffer from increased student loan debt [83] and high rates of housing insecurity [131]. A com-plete critique of the graduate application process and its socio-economical context is out of the scope of this paper. Queer in AI believes it is nonetheless important to provide concrete aid rightnow to applicants faced with the current system.4.1.2 Mutual aid design. The design of the aid program is decentral-ized, community-led constituting volunteers with a diverse range of experiences with graduate school admissions [114]. This initia-tive keeps minimum barriers to receiving the aid by not seeking to decide who is “deserving” of aid, avoiding imposing excessive requirements for documenting eligibility and providing timely men-torship and help to the applicants for their submissions. Although, the payment pipeline often disadvantages applicants from countries and territories where PayPal is not available or restrictions are imposed on receiving transfers from the US.4.1.3 Participatory learnings. Each aid applicant is treated as a member of the community with a valuable perspective of their own – the initiative actively seeks feedback from aid recipient and encourages them to volunteer in the future, which would both help improve the program and keep it sustainable. This feedback indicated that aid recipients’ demographics were more diverse thanQueer in AI’s organizing team (Table 3), which helps Queer in AIrecruit more diverse volunteers and community members by first directly, meaningfully helping them. Also, the feedback survey illustrates widespread deficiencies in existing admissions fee waivers: such as lack of fee waivers (67%), unable to produce adequate documentation (14%) and the fear of outing themselves (10%). This aid program allowed recipients to take admissions tests (56%), avoid skipping essential expenses (54%) and avoid skipping groceries orbills (40%). The vast majority of recipients reported the scholar-ship enabled them to apply to additional programs (around 6 on average).4.1.4 Critical Reflections. The program operates with a tensionbetween opening opportunities to marginalized people from allover the world and reinforcing the exclusionary practices of these powerful institutions. In addition to funding influential and rich academic institutions, the program also indirectly supports the standardized testing industry. The limited amount of funds and barriers to sending the money internationally often pose challenges between the organizers and the aid recipients. In spite of that, Queerin AI believes that it is crucial to provide timely aid regardless of these barriers, even if doing so reinforces undesirable structures.
