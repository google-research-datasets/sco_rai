9,BigScience,Agent,"Turning to more concrete examples, the open science BigScienceproject provides an apt illustration of how ethical, legal, and tec-nical compliance have worked together, influencing each other. BigScience, inspired by large-scale collaboration schemes from the second half of the 20th century, was a value-driven research ini-tiative that brought together over 1000 volunteer researchers from May 2021 to July 2022 to train the BLOOM [71] Language Model And its multilingual dataset ROOTS [54], focusing on topics such as multilingualism, bias-fairness evaluation, data governance, an environmental impact [25]. When viewed from an AI governance standpoint, the BigScienceworkshop distinguishes itself from other ML projects in several ways. Firstly, the BLOOM model was forged through a collaborative effort by researchers from a range of scientific disciplines,which enabled the incorporation of diverse viewpoints. Secondly, the project’s ethical foundation is built upon a collection of values and principles that emphasize inclusive and representative value pluralism. Thirdly, to ensure proper governance, Working Groups were established to scrutinize the project and oversee access and usage. [49]. The combination of these aspects, along with the overtly open character of the research endeavor, presents interesting com-ponents to consider as illustrations. Furthermore, we particularly rely on this example as the interplay among ethical, legal, andtechnical adherence is explicitly presented by the tools and doc-umentation that have been drafted. In the following paragraphs,we illustrate how the tools proper to ethics, law, and computer science that we have exposed worked and interacted with each other through their synergies.BigScience Ethical Charter. Under the auspices of the ethical charter, a mechanism capable of informing the license on the ethical concerns stemming from the capabilities and limitations of the model is the model card. The model card acts as documentation source enabling to inform the license design, based on relevant information such as the intended use of the model, its technical capabilities, or biases. The BigScience ethical charter was framed through a thorough consensus process, with dedicated WorkingGroup participants participating in the drafting procedure to overcome technical challenges and ensure the final version was aligned with technical considerations [2]. For instance, the multilingual factor is also relevant from a technical point of view and not only appropriate for achieving more inclusivity.The ethical compliance work carried out to write the ethical char-ter illustrates how the collective responsibility of an ML project like BigScience can be held by all its contributors. Through its consensus-based mechanism, and the techniques of discourse ethics[42], the project’s researchers had the opportunity to discuss and give definitions of the values they felt were fundamental to guidingthe ML artifact development project. In addition, in the section about the legitimacy and limitations of BigScience’s ethical charter(see: Appendix A.1), the project considers the possibility of ques-tioning its intrinsic values. Thanks to the articulation of ethical,legal, and technical compliance, legal and technical tools can ques-tion the ethical charters’ values and thus adjust and adapt them as an evolving process.Given its normative nature, namely, to define what criteria will guide the development of a specific AI system, ethical charters lay the foundation for implementing its values. When ethical charters are standing in isolation in a given context, being soft law instruments, they cannot be enforced straightforwardly. For this reason,they can be leveraged only in the presence of other prescriptive documents, such as user licenses. For instance, consider the value of ""reproducibility"", which can be explicitly formulated within an ethical charter. This value can be transmitted directly to the license of the ML artifact in question; the latter can explicitly support reproducibility through the distribution and sharing mechanisms itallows, for example, by giving users at large liberty to reuse and study the model. Within this framework, aligned with the ethicalcharter’s values and made explicit by the license, the technical documentation intervenes by indicating the necessary technical specifications. Therefore, in order to ensure the reproduction of the training process and results of an ML artifact, the model card indi-cates the necessary material requirements (e.g., hardware, GPUs)to achieve them. Through the synergies of our analysis framework,and the operationalization of the values expressed by ethical and legal compliance, technical compliance serves to ascertain the fea-sibility of the reproducibility value. The mechanism illustrated inFigure 1 thus serves to not only test factuality but, more importantly,to call into question, where necessary, the values of the ML artifact itself. In this way, the three tools, with their respective expertise,were instrumental in testing, adopting, and adapting the guiding values of the project. As a second example of how our framework operates in a con-crete case, we examine the value of ""accessibility"" in the BigScience ethical charter. Following the analysis of Section 3, this value is extrinsic: it serves as a means to achieve an intrinsic value which is valuable in itself. Within the BigScience workshop, this value has been used to support the intrinsic value of ""openness"" (see:Appendix A.1). Concretely, the value of accessibility made explicit in the ethical charter has been translated into the conditions of redistribution and sharing within the RAIL license (see: Appen-dix A.2). Given the potential risks associated with the propagation of language models, accessibility has been counterbalanced with the intrinsic value of individual and collective responsibility (see:Appendix A.1). The latter makes it possible to identify the moral responsibility of project contributors, simultaneously at the indi-vidual and collective levels. In this framework, ethical compliance thus serves as a support for legal compliance. Namely, the open distribution of artifacts produced by BigScience is tied to a list of use restrictions listed within the BigScience OpenRAIL license (see:Appendix A.2). Similarly, legal compliance, informed by ethics compliance and explicitly by the value of accessibility, the technical compliance tool completes the process of intersections of our frame-work. In this sense, being designed as a technical information tooleven for a non-specialist audience, the BigScience artifact model card is intended to make its understanding accessible through doc-umentation (see: Appendix A.3). By iteratively emphasizing the values outlined in the ethical charter and realized through the ad-ditional compliance tools, a progressive ethical process is set in motion. This process is further enhanced by the adaptable nature of technical specifications, which guide and reshape the formulation of these core values.",349-50,"BigScience, inspired by large-scale collaboration schemes from the second half of the 20th century, was a value-driven research initiative that brought together over 1000 volunteer researchers from May 2021 to July 2022",

This value can be transmitted directly to the license of the ML artifact in question; the latter can explicitly support reproducibility through the distribution and sharing mechanisms itallows, for example, by giving users at large liberty to reuse and study the model. Within this framework, aligned with the ethicalcharter’s values and made explicit by the license, the technical documentation intervenes by indicating the necessary technical specifications. Therefore, in order to ensure the reproduction of the training process and results of an ML artifact, the model card indi-cates the necessary material requirements (e.g., hardware, GPUs)to achieve them. Through the synergies of our analysis framework,and the operationalization of the values expressed by ethical and legal compliance, technical compliance serves to ascertain the fea-sibility of the reproducibility value. The mechanism illustrated inFigure 1 thus serves to not only test factuality but, more importantly,to call into question, where necessary, the values of the ML artifact itself. In this way, the three tools, with their respective expertise,were instrumental in testing, adopting, and adapting the guiding values of the project. As a second example of how our framework operates in a con-crete case, we examine the value of ""accessibility"" in the BigScience ethical charter. Following the analysis of Section 3, this value is extrinsic: it serves as a means to achieve an intrinsic value which is valuable in itself. Within the BigScience workshop, this value has been used to support the intrinsic value of ""openness"" (see:Appendix A.1). Concretely, the value of accessibility made explicit in the ethical charter has been translated into the conditions of redistribution and sharing within the RAIL license (see: Appen-dix A.2). Given the potential risks associated with the propagation of language models, accessibility has been counterbalanced with the intrinsic value of individual and collective responsibility (see:Appendix A.1). The latter makes it possible to identify the moral responsibility of project contributors, simultaneously at the indi-vidual and collective levels. In this framework, ethical compliance thus serves as a support for legal compliance. Namely, the open distribution of artifacts produced by BigScience is tied to a list of use restrictions listed within the BigScience OpenRAIL license (see:Appendix A.2). Similarly, legal compliance, informed by ethics compliance and explicitly by the value of accessibility, the technical compliance tool completes the process of intersections of our frame-work. In this sense, being designed as a technical information tooleven for a non-specialist audience, the BigScience artifact model card is intended to make its understanding accessible through doc-umentation (see: Appendix A.3).

BigScience, inspired by large-scale collaboration schemes from the second half of the 20th century, was a value-driven research ini-tiative that brought together over 1000 volunteer researchers from May 2021 to July 2022 to train the BLOOM [71] Language Model And its multilingual dataset ROOTS [54], focusing on topics such as multilingualism, bias-fairness evaluation, data governance, an environmental impact [25]. When viewed from an AI governance standpoint, the BigScienceworkshop distinguishes itself from other ML projects in several ways. Firstly, the BLOOM model was forged through a collaborative effort by researchers from a range of scientific disciplines,which enabled the incorporation of diverse viewpoints. Secondly, the project’s ethical foundation is built upon a collection of values and principles that emphasize inclusive and representative value pluralism. Thirdly, to ensure proper governance, Working Groups were established to scrutinize the project and oversee access and usage. [49]. The combination of these aspects, along with the overtly open character of the research endeavor, presents interesting com-ponents to consider as illustrations. Furthermore, we particularly rely on this example as the interplay among ethical, legal, andtechnical adherence is explicitly presented by the tools and doc-umentation that have been drafted.

Under the auspices of the ethical charter, a mechanism capable of informing the license on the ethical concerns stemming from the capabilities and limitations of the model is the model card. The model card acts as documentation source enabling to inform the license design, based on relevant information such as the intended use of the model, its technical capabilities, or biases. The BigScience ethical charter was framed through a thorough consensus process, with dedicated WorkingGroup participants participating in the drafting procedure to overcome technical challenges and ensure the final version was aligned with technical considerations [2]. For instance, the multilingual factor is also relevant from a technical point of view and not only appropriate for achieving more inclusivity.The ethical compliance work carried out to write the ethical char-ter illustrates how the collective responsibility of an ML project like BigScience can be held by all its contributors. Through its consensus-based mechanism, and the techniques of discourse ethics[42], the project’s researchers had the opportunity to discuss and give definitions of the values they felt were fundamental to guidingthe ML artifact development project. In addition, in the section about the legitimacy and limitations of BigScience’s ethical charter(see: Appendix A.1), the project considers the possibility of ques-tioning its intrinsic values.

Firstly, the BLOOM model was forged through a collaborative effort by researchers from a range of scientific disciplines,which enabled the incorporation of diverse viewpoints. Secondly, the project’s ethical foundation is built upon a collection of values and principles that emphasize inclusive and representative value pluralism. Thirdly, to ensure proper governance, Working Groups were established to scrutinize the project and oversee access and usage. [49]. The combination of these aspects, along with the overtly open character of the research endeavor, presents interesting com-ponents to consider as illustrations. Furthermore, we particularly rely on this example as the interplay among ethical, legal, andtechnical adherence is explicitly presented by the tools and doc-umentation that have been drafted. In the following paragraphs,we illustrate how the tools proper to ethics, law, and computer science that we have exposed worked and interacted with each other through their synergies.BigScience Ethical Charter. Under the auspices of the ethical charter, a mechanism capable of informing the license on the ethical concerns stemming from the capabilities and limitations of the model is the model card. The model card acts as documentation source enabling to inform the license design, based on relevant information such as the intended use of the model, its technical capabilities, or biases. The BigScience ethical charter was framed through a thorough consensus process, with dedicated WorkingGroup participants participating in the drafting procedure to overcome technical challenges and ensure the final version was aligned with technical considerations [2]. For instance, the multilingual factor is also relevant from a technical point of view and not only appropriate for achieving more inclusivity.The ethical compliance work carried out to write the ethical char-ter illustrates how the collective responsibility of an ML project like BigScience can be held by all its contributors. Through its consensus-based mechanism, and the techniques of discourse ethics[42], the project’s researchers had the opportunity to discuss and give definitions of the values they felt were fundamental to guidingthe ML artifact development project. In addition, in the section about the legitimacy and limitations of BigScience’s ethical charter(see: Appendix A.1), the project considers the possibility of ques-tioning its intrinsic values. Thanks to the articulation of ethical,legal, and technical compliance, legal and technical tools can ques-tion the ethical charters’ values and thus adjust and adapt them as an evolving process.Given its normative nature, namely, to define what criteria will guide the development of a specific AI system, ethical charters lay the foundation for implementing its values. When ethical charters are standing in isolation in a given context, being soft law instruments, they cannot be enforced straightforwardly. For this reason,they can be leveraged only in the presence of other prescriptive documents, such as user licenses. For instance, consider the value of ""reproducibility"", which can be explicitly formulated within an ethical charter. This value can be transmitted directly to the license of the ML artifact in question; the latter can explicitly support reproducibility through the distribution and sharing mechanisms itallows, for example, by giving users at large liberty to reuse and study the model. Within this framework, aligned with the ethicalcharter’s values and made explicit by the license, the technical documentation intervenes by indicating the necessary technical specifications. Therefore, in order to ensure the reproduction of the training process and results of an ML artifact, the model card indi-cates the necessary material requirements (e.g., hardware, GPUs)to achieve them. Through the synergies of our analysis framework,and the operationalization of the values expressed by ethical and legal compliance, technical compliance serves to ascertain the fea-sibility of the reproducibility value. The mechanism illustrated inFigure 1 thus serves to not only test factuality but, more importantly,to call into question, where necessary, the values of the ML artifact itself. In this way, the three tools, with their respective expertise,were instrumental in testing, adopting, and adapting the guiding values of the project. As a second example of how our framework operates in a con-crete case, we examine the value of ""accessibility"" in the BigScience ethical charter. Following the analysis of Section 3, this value is extrinsic: it serves as a means to achieve an intrinsic value which is valuable in itself. Within the BigScience workshop, this value has been used to support the intrinsic value of ""openness"" (see:Appendix A.1). Concretely, the value of accessibility made explicit in the ethical charter has been translated into the conditions of redistribution and sharing within the RAIL license (see: Appen-dix A.2). Given the potential risks associated with the propagation of language models, accessibility has been counterbalanced with the intrinsic value of individual and collective responsibility (see:Appendix A.1). The latter makes it possible to identify the moral responsibility of project contributors, simultaneously at the indi-vidual and collective levels. In this framework, ethical compliance thus serves as a support for legal compliance. Namely, the open distribution of artifacts produced by BigScience is tied to a list of use restrictions listed within the BigScience OpenRAIL license (see:Appendix A.2). Similarly, legal compliance, informed by ethics compliance and explicitly by the value of accessibility, the technical compliance tool completes the process of intersections of our frame-work. In this sense, being designed as a technical information tooleven for a non-specialist audience, the BigScience artifact model card is intended to make its understanding accessible through doc-umentation (see: Appendix A.3). By iteratively emphasizing the values outlined in the ethical charter and realized through the ad-ditional compliance tools, a progressive ethical process is set in motion. This process is further enhanced by the adaptable nature of technical specifications, which guide and reshape the formulation of these core values.",349-50,the project’s ethical foundation is built upon a collection of values and principles that emphasize inclusive and representative value pluralism.
