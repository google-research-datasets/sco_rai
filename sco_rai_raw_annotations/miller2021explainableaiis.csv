9,SkinCancerDA,Agent,"Consider an example of a DA [decision aid] for diagnosing skin cancers, such as the ISIC 2018 lesion diagnosis challenge. There are seven possible disease categories: (1) melanoma; (2) melanocytic nevus; (3) basal cell carcinoma; (4) actinic keratosis; (5) benign keratosis; (6) dermatofibroma; and (7) vascular lesion. Given a dermoscopic image of a legion along with some meta information, such as where the lesion is found, the task is to diagnose the most likely category. Figure 7 shows a simple prototype interface for such a system. In this case, there are seven hypotheses/diagnoses. The DA filters out those that are unlikely, leaving just three: melanoma, basal cell carcinoma (BCC), or actinic keratsosis (AK), highlighted with bold text. By highlighting only likely hypothesis instead of just one,this could help to mitigate fixation on just one option. Hypotheses can be explored. In Figure 7, the location of the lesion, its colour, scarring, and that it sometimes bleeds, is strong support for a BCCdiagnosis. However, the asymmetric shape, itchiness, and recent colour change are evidence against BCC. Other forms of evidence could be provided to the decision maker, such as finding similar instances using case-based reasoning [38, 44]. It is up to the decision maker to make the final decision, integrating their expert knowledge and the information from the DA.",339,"DA [decision aid] for diagnosing skin cancers, such as the ISIC 2018 lesion diagnosis challenge",
