9,UKGovernment,Agent,"A recent study by Collier et al. [18] has uncovered a striking finding- the UK government and law enforcement agencies are utilizing online targeted advertising to influence citizens’ behavior and achieve public policy objectives. This use of online targeting presents unique socio-political implications that warrant further exploration. To Understand the potential consequences, it is essential to first grasp the nature of the UK government’s employment of online targeted advertising.The UK government has a history of attempting to change the behavior of its citizens in order to achieve public policy goals. Following the establishment of the Behavioural Insights Team (also known as Nudge Unit) in 2010, the government has been openly applying nudge theory to public policy [18]. The Team’s objectives to influence people’s choices by designing appropriate incentives or obstacles, thereby encouraging the desired options, all while incorporating insights from behavioral economics [38]. The NudgeUnit’s inception was fueled by the growing popularity of behav-ioral change techniques combined with social marketing practices among UK public policy makers, who had been experimenting with the application of commercial marketing principles to promote public goods since 2004 [64]. Examples of the Team’s initiatives include adjusting tobacco prices to deter individuals from purchasing it or incorporating carefully crafted tax prompts in letters to taxpayers to encourage prompt payments (e.g., ""most people pay their tax on time"") [38].While influencing citizens’ behavior for the purpose of achiev-ing public policy objectives is not a new practice for the UK govern-ment, what is a new practice is combining these behavior change strategies with the infrastructures of online targeted advertising.3As explained in Section 2, those infrastructures involve data gathering and processing by machine learning algorithms to create profiles of individuals and groups so that messages specifically tailored to each profile can be created and delivered to those deemed susceptible. Collier et al.’s research [18] shows that government departments are combining operational data gathered and produced by state institutions and the associated systems of classification and profiling of social groups (e.g. the needs, risks and vulnerabili-ties of groups such as patients, immigrants and welfare recipients) with data gathered and produced by commercial companies and the internet economy (e.g. clicks, page visits, shopping habits, social media activity, and online social interactions). The hybridisation of the two categories of data and their algorithmic processing allows for both a wide and a deep insight into UK’s communities and individuals. During the past decade, the UK government ran numerous campaigns at the heart of which was online targeting. Collier et al. [18]map those into three distinct modes of operation, which we term(i) the minimally targeted mode, (ii) the maximally targeted mode,and (iii) the outsourced mode for ease of reference. The first two modes are delivered by government and law enforcement agencies and differ in the level of sophistication of the targeting used. In Contrast, the last mode involves outsourcing the services of private sector companies but is on par with the maximally targeted mode in terms of targeting sophistication.The first and the least sophisticated mode, i.e., the minimally targeted mode, amounts to simply extending the advertising scopeto online spaces through online advertisement buys. As the name suggests, this mode is minimally targeted as it does not involve much audience segregation or reliance on individuals’ profiles but is targeted at entire population groups. It involves actions such as running advertisements on Tiktok to reach younger audiences.The second and significantly more sophisticated mode of op-eration, which we term the maximally targeted mode, leverages targeting to reach specific groups or individuals and informs the design of the run adverts. This mode employs algorithms that enhance personalization and relies on a network of government entities led by the Government Communication Service to develop nationwide behavior change strategies. In addition to implementing multi-site and single-site campaigns to change behavior through tailored mes-sages, this mode also includes countering misinformation online and protecting the government’s reputation from negative mes-sages. One notable example cited by Collier et al. [18, p.7]. is a fire safety campaign by the Home Office, where the department utilized purchasing data from individuals who recently bought candles on Amazon and targeted them with fire safety messages through their smart speakers, such as Alexa.The maximally targeted mode also involves leveraging the max-imally targeted technologies and methods employed by law en-forcement for preventive purposes. A prime example of this is the CYBER CHOICES preventative diversion program ran by the UKNational Crime Agency (NCA) in collaboration with behavioral psychologists [18]. This initiative utilized Google and YouTube ad-vertisements targeted towards UK adolescents between the ages of 14 and 20 who were identified through NCA surveillance as potentially interested in gaming. The ads would appear whenever they searched for cybercrime services and warn them of the illegal nature of purchasing such services and the consequences they could face if they did so. As a part of this campaign, NCA officers also visited the identified ""targets"" at their homes, discussed their online behavior with their parents, and invited them to workshops or-ganised and ran by NCA. The goal of those workshops was twofold.Firstly, the individuals were taught the skills required to turn their legitimate interests into a legitimate career. Secondly, NCA used the workshops to gather data to optimize the design of further targeted ads. There is evidence that this particular campaign was successful in reducing the rate of cybercrime [17].The third and final mode of operation, the outsourced mode,entails entrusting the entire process of designing, developing, and executing campaigns to private sector companies [18]. One instance is SuperSisters, a Muslim online lifestyle platform established by J-Go Media in 2015, aimed at young British Muslim girls. Although Marketed as a platform for sharing and creation of empowering content, the project sparked controversy when it was revealed that it was covertly funded by a government counter-extremism arm and that the content on the website was carefully curated to counteract what the state deemed to be ""overtly Islamic"" [43]. Another example includes a UK Home Office-supported knife prevention campaign,targeting young Black individuals residing in London’s deprived neighborhoods, created by FCB Inferno and All City Media [18]. The campaign’s offline component included messages displayed on takeout boxes in fried chicken restaurants, based on police data which indicated that Black individuals commit more knife crime and perpetuated a racist stereotype that they consume fried chicken[76]. The online component aimed at young Black males living in impoverished areas of London drew upon the same data and stereotype.",1873-4,the UK government,

15,GovernmentCommunicationService,Agent,"A recent study by Collier et al. [18] has uncovered a striking finding- the UK government and law enforcement agencies are utilizing online targeted advertising to influence citizens’ behavior and achieve public policy objectives. This use of online targeting presents unique socio-political implications that warrant further exploration. To Understand the potential consequences, it is essential to first grasp the nature of the UK government’s employment of online targeted advertising.The UK government has a history of attempting to change the behavior of its citizens in order to achieve public policy goals. Following the establishment of the Behavioural Insights Team (also known as Nudge Unit) in 2010, the government has been openly applying nudge theory to public policy [18]. The Team’s objectives to influence people’s choices by designing appropriate incentives or obstacles, thereby encouraging the desired options, all while incorporating insights from behavioral economics [38]. The NudgeUnit’s inception was fueled by the growing popularity of behav-ioral change techniques combined with social marketing practices among UK public policy makers, who had been experimenting with the application of commercial marketing principles to promote public goods since 2004 [64]. Examples of the Team’s initiatives include adjusting tobacco prices to deter individuals from purchasing it or incorporating carefully crafted tax prompts in letters to taxpayers to encourage prompt payments (e.g., ""most people pay their tax on time"") [38].While influencing citizens’ behavior for the purpose of achiev-ing public policy objectives is not a new practice for the UK govern-ment, what is a new practice is combining these behavior change strategies with the infrastructures of online targeted advertising.3As explained in Section 2, those infrastructures involve data gathering and processing by machine learning algorithms to create profiles of individuals and groups so that messages specifically tailored to each profile can be created and delivered to those deemed susceptible. Collier et al.’s research [18] shows that government departments are combining operational data gathered and produced by state institutions and the associated systems of classification and profiling of social groups (e.g. the needs, risks and vulnerabili-ties of groups such as patients, immigrants and welfare recipients) with data gathered and produced by commercial companies and the internet economy (e.g. clicks, page visits, shopping habits, social media activity, and online social interactions). The hybridisation of the two categories of data and their algorithmic processing allows for both a wide and a deep insight into UK’s communities and individuals. During the past decade, the UK government ran numerous campaigns at the heart of which was online targeting. Collier et al. [18]map those into three distinct modes of operation, which we term(i) the minimally targeted mode, (ii) the maximally targeted mode,and (iii) the outsourced mode for ease of reference. The first two modes are delivered by government and law enforcement agencies and differ in the level of sophistication of the targeting used. In Contrast, the last mode involves outsourcing the services of private sector companies but is on par with the maximally targeted mode in terms of targeting sophistication.The first and the least sophisticated mode, i.e., the minimally targeted mode, amounts to simply extending the advertising scopeto online spaces through online advertisement buys.

Examples of the Team’s initiatives include adjusting tobacco prices to deter individuals from purchasing it or incorporating carefully crafted tax prompts in letters to taxpayers to encourage prompt payments (e.g., ""most people pay their tax on time"") [38].While influencing citizens’ behavior for the purpose of achiev-ing public policy objectives is not a new practice for the UK govern-ment, what is a new practice is combining these behavior change strategies with the infrastructures of online targeted advertising.3As explained in Section 2, those infrastructures involve data gathering and processing by machine learning algorithms to create profiles of individuals and groups so that messages specifically tailored to each profile can be created and delivered to those deemed susceptible. Collier et al.’s research [18] shows that government departments are combining operational data gathered and produced by state institutions and the associated systems of classification and profiling of social groups (e.g. the needs, risks and vulnerabili-ties of groups such as patients, immigrants and welfare recipients) with data gathered and produced by commercial companies and the internet economy (e.g. clicks, page visits, shopping habits, social media activity, and online social interactions). The hybridisation of the two categories of data and their algorithmic processing allows for both a wide and a deep insight into UK’s communities and individuals. During the past decade, the UK government ran numerous campaigns at the heart of which was online targeting. Collier et al. [18]map those into three distinct modes of operation, which we term(i) the minimally targeted mode, (ii) the maximally targeted mode,and (iii) the outsourced mode for ease of reference. The first two modes are delivered by government and law enforcement agencies and differ in the level of sophistication of the targeting used. In Contrast, the last mode involves outsourcing the services of private sector companies but is on par with the maximally targeted mode in terms of targeting sophistication.The first and the least sophisticated mode, i.e., the minimally targeted mode, amounts to simply extending the advertising scopeto online spaces through online advertisement buys. As the name suggests, this mode is minimally targeted as it does not involve much audience segregation or reliance on individuals’ profiles but is targeted at entire population groups. It involves actions such as running advertisements on Tiktok to reach younger audiences.The second and significantly more sophisticated mode of op-eration, which we term the maximally targeted mode, leverages targeting to reach specific groups or individuals and informs the design of the run adverts. This mode employs algorithms that enhance personalization and relies on a network of government entities led by the Government Communication Service to develop nationwide behavior change strategies. In addition to implementing multi-site and single-site campaigns to change behavior through tailored mes-sages, this mode also includes countering misinformation online and protecting the government’s reputation from negative mes-sages. One notable example cited by Collier et al. [18, p.7]. is a fire safety campaign by the Home Office, where the department utilized purchasing data from individuals who recently bought candles on Amazon and targeted them with fire safety messages through their smart speakers, such as Alexa.The maximally targeted mode also involves leveraging the max-imally targeted technologies and methods employed by law en-forcement for preventive purposes. A prime example of this is the CYBER CHOICES preventative diversion program ran by the UKNational Crime Agency (NCA) in collaboration with behavioral psychologists [18]. This initiative utilized Google and YouTube ad-vertisements targeted towards UK adolescents between the ages of 14 and 20 who were identified through NCA surveillance as potentially interested in gaming. The ads would appear whenever they searched for cybercrime services and warn them of the illegal nature of purchasing such services and the consequences they could face if they did so. As a part of this campaign, NCA officers also visited the identified ""targets"" at their homes, discussed their online behavior with their parents, and invited them to workshops or-ganised and ran by NCA. The goal of those workshops was twofold.Firstly, the individuals were taught the skills required to turn their legitimate interests into a legitimate career. Secondly, NCA used the workshops to gather data to optimize the design of further targeted ads. There is evidence that this particular campaign was successful in reducing the rate of cybercrime [17].The third and final mode of operation, the outsourced mode,entails entrusting the entire process of designing, developing, and executing campaigns to private sector companies [18]. One instance is SuperSisters, a Muslim online lifestyle platform established by J-Go Media in 2015, aimed at young British Muslim girls. Although Marketed as a platform for sharing and creation of empowering content, the project sparked controversy when it was revealed that it was covertly funded by a government counter-extremism arm and that the content on the website was carefully curated to counteract what the state deemed to be ""overtly Islamic"" [43]. Another example includes a UK Home Office-supported knife prevention campaign,targeting young Black individuals residing in London’s deprived neighborhoods, created by FCB Inferno and All City Media [18]. The campaign’s offline component included messages displayed on takeout boxes in fried chicken restaurants, based on police data which indicated that Black individuals commit more knife crime and perpetuated a racist stereotype that they consume fried chicken[76].

26,KnifePreventionCampagin,Artifact,"A recent study by Collier et al. [18] has uncovered a striking finding- the UK government and law enforcement agencies are utilizing online targeted advertising to influence citizens’ behavior and achieve public policy objectives. This use of online targeting presents unique socio-political implications that warrant further exploration. To Understand the potential consequences, it is essential to first grasp the nature of the UK government’s employment of online targeted advertising.The UK government has a history of attempting to change the behavior of its citizens in order to achieve public policy goals. Following the establishment of the Behavioural Insights Team (also known as Nudge Unit) in 2010, the government has been openly applying nudge theory to public policy [18]. The Team’s objectives to influence people’s choices by designing appropriate incentives or obstacles, thereby encouraging the desired options, all while incorporating insights from behavioral economics [38]. The NudgeUnit’s inception was fueled by the growing popularity of behav-ioral change techniques combined with social marketing practices among UK public policy makers, who had been experimenting with the application of commercial marketing principles to promote public goods since 2004 [64]. Examples of the Team’s initiatives include adjusting tobacco prices to deter individuals from purchasing it or incorporating carefully crafted tax prompts in letters to taxpayers to encourage prompt payments (e.g., ""most people pay their tax on time"") [38].While influencing citizens’ behavior for the purpose of achiev-ing public policy objectives is not a new practice for the UK govern-ment, what is a new practice is combining these behavior change strategies with the infrastructures of online targeted advertising.3As explained in Section 2, those infrastructures involve data gathering and processing by machine learning algorithms to create profiles of individuals and groups so that messages specifically tailored to each profile can be created and delivered to those deemed susceptible. Collier et al.’s research [18] shows that government departments are combining operational data gathered and produced by state institutions and the associated systems of classification and profiling of social groups (e.g. the needs, risks and vulnerabili-ties of groups such as patients, immigrants and welfare recipients) with data gathered and produced by commercial companies and the internet economy (e.g. clicks, page visits, shopping habits, social media activity, and online social interactions). The hybridisation of the two categories of data and their algorithmic processing allows for both a wide and a deep insight into UK’s communities and individuals. During the past decade, the UK government ran numerous campaigns at the heart of which was online targeting. Collier et al. [18]map those into three distinct modes of operation, which we term(i) the minimally targeted mode, (ii) the maximally targeted mode,and (iii) the outsourced mode for ease of reference. The first two modes are delivered by government and law enforcement agencies and differ in the level of sophistication of the targeting used. In Contrast, the last mode involves outsourcing the services of private sector companies but is on par with the maximally targeted mode in terms of targeting sophistication.The first and the least sophisticated mode, i.e., the minimally targeted mode, amounts to simply extending the advertising scopeto online spaces through online advertisement buys. As the name suggests, this mode is minimally targeted as it does not involve much audience segregation or reliance on individuals’ profiles but is targeted at entire population groups. It involves actions such as running advertisements on Tiktok to reach younger audiences.The second and significantly more sophisticated mode of op-eration, which we term the maximally targeted mode, leverages targeting to reach specific groups or individuals and informs the design of the run adverts. This mode employs algorithms that enhance personalization and relies on a network of government entities led by the Government Communication Service to develop nationwide behavior change strategies. In addition to implementing multi-site and single-site campaigns to change behavior through tailored mes-sages, this mode also includes countering misinformation online and protecting the government’s reputation from negative mes-sages. One notable example cited by Collier et al. [18, p.7]. is a fire safety campaign by the Home Office, where the department utilized purchasing data from individuals who recently bought candles on Amazon and targeted them with fire safety messages through their smart speakers, such as Alexa.The maximally targeted mode also involves leveraging the max-imally targeted technologies and methods employed by law en-forcement for preventive purposes.

Examples of the Team’s initiatives include adjusting tobacco prices to deter individuals from purchasing it or incorporating carefully crafted tax prompts in letters to taxpayers to encourage prompt payments (e.g., ""most people pay their tax on time"") [38].While influencing citizens’ behavior for the purpose of achiev-ing public policy objectives is not a new practice for the UK govern-ment, what is a new practice is combining these behavior change strategies with the infrastructures of online targeted advertising.3As explained in Section 2, those infrastructures involve data gathering and processing by machine learning algorithms to create profiles of individuals and groups so that messages specifically tailored to each profile can be created and delivered to those deemed susceptible. Collier et al.’s research [18] shows that government departments are combining operational data gathered and produced by state institutions and the associated systems of classification and profiling of social groups (e.g. the needs, risks and vulnerabili-ties of groups such as patients, immigrants and welfare recipients) with data gathered and produced by commercial companies and the internet economy (e.g. clicks, page visits, shopping habits, social media activity, and online social interactions). The hybridisation of the two categories of data and their algorithmic processing allows for both a wide and a deep insight into UK’s communities and individuals. During the past decade, the UK government ran numerous campaigns at the heart of which was online targeting. Collier et al. [18]map those into three distinct modes of operation, which we term(i) the minimally targeted mode, (ii) the maximally targeted mode,and (iii) the outsourced mode for ease of reference. The first two modes are delivered by government and law enforcement agencies and differ in the level of sophistication of the targeting used. In Contrast, the last mode involves outsourcing the services of private sector companies but is on par with the maximally targeted mode in terms of targeting sophistication.The first and the least sophisticated mode, i.e., the minimally targeted mode, amounts to simply extending the advertising scopeto online spaces through online advertisement buys. As the name suggests, this mode is minimally targeted as it does not involve much audience segregation or reliance on individuals’ profiles but is targeted at entire population groups. It involves actions such as running advertisements on Tiktok to reach younger audiences.The second and significantly more sophisticated mode of op-eration, which we term the maximally targeted mode, leverages targeting to reach specific groups or individuals and informs the design of the run adverts. This mode employs algorithms that enhance personalization and relies on a network of government entities led by the Government Communication Service to develop nationwide behavior change strategies. In addition to implementing multi-site and single-site campaigns to change behavior through tailored mes-sages, this mode also includes countering misinformation online and protecting the government’s reputation from negative mes-sages. One notable example cited by Collier et al. [18, p.7]. is a fire safety campaign by the Home Office, where the department utilized purchasing data from individuals who recently bought candles on Amazon and targeted them with fire safety messages through their smart speakers, such as Alexa.The maximally targeted mode also involves leveraging the max-imally targeted technologies and methods employed by law en-forcement for preventive purposes. A prime example of this is the CYBER CHOICES preventative diversion program ran by the UKNational Crime Agency (NCA) in collaboration with behavioral psychologists [18]. This initiative utilized Google and YouTube ad-vertisements targeted towards UK adolescents between the ages of 14 and 20 who were identified through NCA surveillance as potentially interested in gaming. The ads would appear whenever they searched for cybercrime services and warn them of the illegal nature of purchasing such services and the consequences they could face if they did so. As a part of this campaign, NCA officers also visited the identified ""targets"" at their homes, discussed their online behavior with their parents, and invited them to workshops or-ganised and ran by NCA. The goal of those workshops was twofold.Firstly, the individuals were taught the skills required to turn their legitimate interests into a legitimate career. Secondly, NCA used the workshops to gather data to optimize the design of further targeted ads. There is evidence that this particular campaign was successful in reducing the rate of cybercrime [17].The third and final mode of operation, the outsourced mode,entails entrusting the entire process of designing, developing, and executing campaigns to private sector companies [18]. One instance is SuperSisters, a Muslim online lifestyle platform established by J-Go Media in 2015, aimed at young British Muslim girls. Although Marketed as a platform for sharing and creation of empowering content, the project sparked controversy when it was revealed that it was covertly funded by a government counter-extremism arm and that the content on the website was carefully curated to counteract what the state deemed to be ""overtly Islamic"" [43]. Another example includes a UK Home Office-supported knife prevention campaign,targeting young Black individuals residing in London’s deprived neighborhoods, created by FCB Inferno and All City Media [18]. The campaign’s offline component included messages displayed on takeout boxes in fried chicken restaurants, based on police data which indicated that Black individuals commit more knife crime and perpetuated a racist stereotype that they consume fried chicken[76].

40,SuperSisters,reflectsPrecept,CovertCounterextremism,"A recent study by Collier et al. [18] has uncovered a striking finding- the UK government and law enforcement agencies are utilizing online targeted advertising to influence citizens’ behavior and achieve public policy objectives. This use of online targeting presents unique socio-political implications that warrant further exploration. To Understand the potential consequences, it is essential to first grasp the nature of the UK government’s employment of online targeted advertising.The UK government has a history of attempting to change the behavior of its citizens in order to achieve public policy goals. Following the establishment of the Behavioural Insights Team (also known as Nudge Unit) in 2010, the government has been openly applying nudge theory to public policy [18]. The Team’s objectives to influence people’s choices by designing appropriate incentives or obstacles, thereby encouraging the desired options, all while incorporating insights from behavioral economics [38]. The NudgeUnit’s inception was fueled by the growing popularity of behav-ioral change techniques combined with social marketing practices among UK public policy makers, who had been experimenting with the application of commercial marketing principles to promote public goods since 2004 [64]. Examples of the Team’s initiatives include adjusting tobacco prices to deter individuals from purchasing it or incorporating carefully crafted tax prompts in letters to taxpayers to encourage prompt payments (e.g., ""most people pay their tax on time"") [38].While influencing citizens’ behavior for the purpose of achiev-ing public policy objectives is not a new practice for the UK govern-ment, what is a new practice is combining these behavior change strategies with the infrastructures of online targeted advertising.3As explained in Section 2, those infrastructures involve data gathering and processing by machine learning algorithms to create profiles of individuals and groups so that messages specifically tailored to each profile can be created and delivered to those deemed susceptible. Collier et al.’s research [18] shows that government departments are combining operational data gathered and produced by state institutions and the associated systems of classification and profiling of social groups (e.g. the needs, risks and vulnerabili-ties of groups such as patients, immigrants and welfare recipients) with data gathered and produced by commercial companies and the internet economy (e.g. clicks, page visits, shopping habits, social media activity, and online social interactions). The hybridisation of the two categories of data and their algorithmic processing allows for both a wide and a deep insight into UK’s communities and individuals. During the past decade, the UK government ran numerous campaigns at the heart of which was online targeting. Collier et al. [18]map those into three distinct modes of operation, which we term(i) the minimally targeted mode, (ii) the maximally targeted mode,and (iii) the outsourced mode for ease of reference. The first two modes are delivered by government and law enforcement agencies and differ in the level of sophistication of the targeting used. In Contrast, the last mode involves outsourcing the services of private sector companies but is on par with the maximally targeted mode in terms of targeting sophistication.The first and the least sophisticated mode, i.e., the minimally targeted mode, amounts to simply extending the advertising scopeto online spaces through online advertisement buys. As the name suggests, this mode is minimally targeted as it does not involve much audience segregation or reliance on individuals’ profiles but is targeted at entire population groups. It involves actions such as running advertisements on Tiktok to reach younger audiences.The second and significantly more sophisticated mode of op-eration, which we term the maximally targeted mode, leverages targeting to reach specific groups or individuals and informs the design of the run adverts. This mode employs algorithms that enhance personalization and relies on a network of government entities led by the Government Communication Service to develop nationwide behavior change strategies. In addition to implementing multi-site and single-site campaigns to change behavior through tailored mes-sages, this mode also includes countering misinformation online and protecting the government’s reputation from negative mes-sages.
