9,HeteronormativityInAdvertising,Perceived_Problem,"We conducted 18 semi-structured interviews over Zoom lasting between 30 and 45 minutes, which were recorded for transcription and analysis. Participants received a written consent form before the interviews and were compensated with a $15 Amazon gift card distributed via email afterward. Participants in this paper are identified by unique anonymous identifiers (P1 - P18) to maintain their privacy. Our study was reviewed and approved by the StanfordUniversity Institutional Review Board.In the interviews, we asked about participants’ experiences with online advertising in three parts: first asking questions about their experiences overall with online ads, second asking them to reflect on ad targeting and its relationship to various aspects of their iden-tities, and third relating to their identity as an LGBTQ+ person. The Complete interview guide is listed in Appendix A. At the close of the interview, we asked participants open-ended demographic ques-tions, having them provide any or all of the following in their own words: age, gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity, and nationality.Part 1: Online advertising. We asked participants which platforms they were most active on, how frequently they encountered ads on those platforms, and what types of advertising they encountered.We also sought to understand how and why participants engaged with ads they considered compelling, asking participants to recall an ad they had recently interacted with and reflect on the charac-teristics, including aspects of the images or text, that drew their attention.Part 2: Ad targeting. Next, to understand participants’ beliefs about what inferences ad platforms may be making and how they believe such inferences are made, we asked them to reflect on the kinds of themes, people, and other imagery they usually see in their targeted ads, and speculate as to why they receive such content. Wealso explored the relationship of this content with multiple aspects of their identities, asking about feelings of mis/representation and whether or not they wanted these identity aspects to be represented and/or inferred by ad targeting systems.Part 3: Targeted ads and LGBTQ+ identity. In our final set of interview questions, we explored participants’ perceptions of pos-itive and negative impacts on LGBTQ+ people and communities.In relation to negative impacts, we asked further questions about participants' knowledge and use of strategies for avoiding ad tar-geting, as well as what they would like to see changed (including more realistic and more speculative ideas). Though extant theoretical frameworks shaped our inquiries in this work, our goal was to let the patterns of our data guide our anal-ysis, so we chose a reflexive approach [11]. Initially, one author conducted line-by-line open coding of all transcripts to develop a codebook of keywords and sub-keywords. Using this codebook,another author took a second pass, coding the transcripts a second time and updating, replacing, or adding additional keywords as needed. The first coding pass was conducted using NVivo qual-itative analysis software, while the second was conducted usingDelve for better collaboration. After collaborative discussions of the coded content, these two authors came to a consensus about the final set of codes and coded content. Examples of codes included: “binary gender norms”, “control/autonomy”, “lacking nuance”, and“feels creepy”.Themes were collaboratively synthesized based on the most prevalent codes, developed narratively, and divided into three major sets of insights pertaining to participants’ views on ad content, ad targeting as it currently exists, and ideals and alternatives they envisioned. We re-referenced the interview transcripts to refine and finalize themes, ensuring they emerged as directly as possible from our data. This study involves data collection with LGBTQ+ individuals, a group that has specific privacy and safety concerns. This is espe-cially true given the range of risks faced by some queer people due to their nationalities (homosexuality is still criminalized in some countries [57]), gender identities (transgender people, especially transfeminine people of color, face a disproportionate risk of vio-lence [22]), and other attributes. We, the research team, took care of our recruitment, data collection, and analysis to retain their con-fidentiality, including not requiring participants to provide their legal names, compensating them using gift cards not attached to their legal identities, and ensuring that only the research team had access to the transcripts and recordings. Additionally, we acknowl-edge the tensions and risks inherent to conducting research focused on marginalized communities and individuals [40]. Our resulting analysis is not only shaped by a theoretical grounding in queer and feminist theory, but each author’s individual experiences as a per-son marginalized along the axes of gender, race, sexuality, ethnicity,and other identities (with overlaps and privileges therein). We divide our findings regarding ad content into three main points:the overarching lack of representations of queerness, stereotypical-ity when such identities were seen in ads, and the particular lack of representation faced by those with multiple marginalized identities.4.1.1 Participants’ ads reflect heterosexual societal norms. Although participants did widely report receiving ads targeted to them that depicted queer people, across the board they reported that many or most of the ads they saw were instead reflective of dominant hetero-sexual societal norms. P5 summarized, “I think there is starting to become change, but I see a lot of ... stereotypically, traditionally beau-tiful [people in ads] who are tall, or thin, or white, or able-bodied,etc.” (P5). This was echoed by other participants; P16 described the people they saw as being “generally either thin white men or thin white women. Generally attractive people” (P16). Another, despite seeing some ads geared towards queer people, noted that “most of the ads I see I typically feature straight couples” (P2). This aligns with prior work about ads’ reflections of dominant culture [60].4.1.2 Representations of queerness perpetuate stereotypes. The overall lack of queer representation was exacerbated by the heavy pres-ence of stereotypes in targeted ads seemingly intended to interestqueer consumers. In line with Kates [36]’s assessment that advertis-ing as an activity reflects dominant discourses, P1 described feeling caricatured: “It’s like the stereotype of what a gay man is ... like super dramatized, a point where I’m like, I don’t know anybody who acts like that. [...] I don’t know who’s relating to that; it’s [how]straight people think gay people act” (P1).More specifically, participants mentioned seeing stereotypes relating queerness to promiscuity and substance use. P6 describe some of the ads they saw as “hypersexualized”: “The advertisements are all, like, nightclub lighting, like all of these hot 32-year-old with basically all their clothes off, dancing and making out with each other” (P6). They clarified, “I don’t think that’s bad, it looks like they’re having a great time, but it’s really weird. I’m not sure if I consider it offensive or not.” Another described the ads they saw representing queer people as “pertaining to drinking, like fo rbeers” (P15). Unfortunately, this is nothing new; as prior literature has recorded, and some of our older participants remembered, such stereotypes reflect historical patterns in advertising [60]. P13 (age41) noted, “It used to be [that] alcohol and cigarettes were the only companies [with] gay [representation in] ads, so that felt a little stigmatizing” (P13).Other participants also felt misrepresented by content that, de-spite featuring appropriate representations of queerness, did not align with their own personal queer identities. For instance, a high-femme lesbian participant pointed out that the queer-targeted ads she received made “incorrect assumptions” about her gender presentation: “While I am gay, that does not immediately imply that Iwant to dress androgynously” (P11).4.1.3 Lack of diversity especially impacts those with intersecting identities. The lack of diversity in ad content was especially notice-able for those holding multiple marginalized identities, including participants of color; trans, non-binary, and gender-nonconforming participants; those with disabilities; and fat participants. A majority of participants observed a lack of racial diversity in their targeted ads; both white and non-white participants had their targeted advertisements dominated by depictions of white people. P1, a gay Iraqi man, described his targeted ads as being centered on white Western lifestyles and perspectives, sharing,“Any identities outside of that are super hard to see, or they're super exaggerated” (P1). This was one of the most widely-reported themes; 14 out of 18 participants mentioned the overwhelming whiteness in their ads. Gender-nonconforming participants noted that even when systems accurately determined their gender identities, their targeted ads reflected heteropatriarchy assumptions about their experi-ences. P6, a non-binary lesbian, reflected on the inadequacy of the lesbian representation they saw in ads: “Where there’s a lesbian cou-ple, usually both women are white and very feminine [with] longhair—I don’t really think we’ll ever see that much butch [represen-tation] because of the way our culture constructs what a beautiful woman looks like” (P6). A non-binary participant reported, “I feel like [my ads] are targeted more towards trans men, or someonewho’s more masculine than I am” (P2). Participants also cited a lack of body diversity in the models they saw, in particular a lack of depictions of fatness and disability. Consistent with prior work [23], our participants considered this problematic: “I’m a fat person ... I’m part of a lot of groups for other fat people. I think a lot of ads show me weight loss [content]because they assume that ... I want to lose weight, so that’s one thing they get wrong” (P3). Another participant reported that their ads overlook “disability or chronic illness—I have some chronic illnesses and friends who do as well, and it can be hard to see ads that don’t represent your queer friend group” (P5). Aside from their concerns about ad content, all participants reflected some degree of awareness and discomfort with ad target-ing systems identifying them as queer, a type of inference they were easily able to identify: “[Unlike ads for straight people,] you can really tell the ad targeting is for queer people; [advertisers]make it so obvious” (P18). Their responses to these inference- and categorization-based systems’ treatment ranged from mild discom-fort to experiences of significant emotional harm.4.2.1 Ad targeting made participants feel unsettled and unsafe.While participants expressed frustration with targeted advertis-ing that missed the mark, they shared that that accurate targeting often felt “creepy” (P8), “disconcerting” (P13), and even “scary” (P3).Creepiness, in particular, was a recurring theme. P3 reported feeling torn between the desire for convenience and this creepiness: “I get kind of creeped out when [ad systems] seem like they know a lot of things about my life and my interests. [...] From convenience sake,I’ll be more likely to see things that I’d be interested in ... but then,on the other hand, I don’t like advertisements and how all these places are collecting personal data about me” (P3).Taking the same perspective from the opposite direction, P4described that misrepresentative content sometimes felt reassur-ing, in that the ad targeting system “doesn’t really know me” (P4).Feeling “seen” by targeted ad systems frequently felt as much like surveillance as inclusion. In the United Sates, where most majora's platforms are based, legal protection of queer identities is based on the right to privacy [30]; it is unsurprising, then, that queerpeople’s privacy concerns are highly specific, and connected to their larger concerns about their civil rights. P11, a lesbian transwoman who expressed a desire for ads more relevant to her transidentity, expressed simultaneous concern: “I just don’t love the idea that the internet sees me for me, because that’s kind of danger-ous sometimes. There are state legislatures and whole countries that have passed laws to try to make it difficult, if not straight-up impossible, for me to live” (P11).4.2.2 Participants made sense of ad targeting and its failures. Partic-ipants had many plausible hypotheses for the mechanisms behind their targeted ads, including their own behaviors (P18: “I like to do creative writing so I go to baby name websites to look for names for characters, and ... the ads might be thinking, oh this person is pregnant because they’re looking up baby names”), and advertisers lacking nuanced understandings of queerness (P1, a gay middle eastern man, described many of his ads as “completely alienating to other members of the community [besides white gay men]”).Another common explanation participants pointed to was the advertising industry itself. P14 described white-centric ad content as being reflective of “the nature of the advertising business”, as well as broader social norms: “A lot of the ads showcase white gay male models—cisgender, white models—which, I mean, that’s obviously problematic, but it’s also a reflection of kind of the hegemonic discourse that is almost always in queer spaces, right? Unless you’rein a particularly non-white space.” (P14)4.2.3 Corporate tokenization of queerness contributes to skepticism. I don’t want them to market toward me—like, I don't think that companies can have a genuine care about communities that I’m part of, so I’d rather they [not] before and try to just get my money. (P4)Many participants were attuned to the financial incentives for brands targeting queer customers. They found this motive oppor-tunistic and profit-seeking, describing it as undermining the value of representation: “They’re all trying to get me to buy things, that’swhat their end goal is, because capitalism. So I feel like that’s a root of problematic advertising, is that they don’t really care about the impact, they just want you to buy” (P3). In the context of trans-gender representation, P18 expressed that increased inclusion feltshallow and performative: “[Many organizations are] jumping on the bandwagon, and when it actually comes down to support trans rights, they’re not there” (P18). Several participants reported that this kind of opportunistic rep-resentation, which they described as tokenizing, insincere, or pink-washing, was especially common during Pride Month, even from brands and organizations that otherwise did not otherwise make an effort to include queer customers among their customer base: “During Pride Month in New York, where there were a lot of ads Ifelt didn’t really target me correctly—they were just like, here’s the corporation, we put a rainbow logo on it” (P5).4.2.4 Queer people suffer emotional harms due to ad targeting.I think it’s the ads that are creating unrealistic image of our community and of ourselves. (P8)As described in 4.1, participants found themselves targeted with some content that was obviously damaging, including ads for al-cohol (given that members of the LGBTQ+ community are dispro-portionately likely to suffer from substance abuse issues [50]), and those for weight loss (P3: “I would say, yeah, probably more so when I was younger than now, but still I would say [weight loss ads] probably do impact my body image issues”).Participants, especially (but not exclusively) those identifying as trans and non-binary, frequently reported feeling misgendered by their targeted ads. Misgendering—when the gendered elements of language used or the underlying inferences made about someone are incongruent with an individual’s gender identity—is a form of harm commonly experienced by transgender people, though it can occur to others as well [42]. One non-binary participant (who doesn't identify as a woman) described feeling misgendered by their ads:“I feel the misrepresentation the most when it has to do with babies,and I feel like those ads are always very gendered, very targeted towards women and society’s idea of [what] a mother or a womanist. [Those] ads make me feel very weird” (P2). Explaining the impact this has on their self-image, they said, “When I see ads, especially marriage- and pregnancy-related ads that are targeted towards women, it does make [me] feel like, oh no, is this how people[in real life] see me, if this is what my browsing data indicates?”(P2). A cisgender gay male participant also reported receiving ads targeted to women, and that this made him question his identity for a time: “I did struggle a lot with my gender identity for a while because when you’re constantly getting ... ads targeted for a female,I was like, how do I identify? [...] I think it does create a lot of confusion” (P1). This feeling of confusion was also echoed by anon-binary participant who reported that the oscillating gender essentialist extremes in their ads led them to conclude that these systems found their identity “confusing.” They explained, “For some reason I get a lot of ads related to pregnancy or having children.On the other end of the spectrum, I get a lot of ads for jocks straps,which I don’t really understand. But I think [the system is] very confused about what my gender is” (P18).In addition to these direct harms, participants also expressed experiencing more nebulous harm caused by ads acting as a reminder of power and privilege in society at large. As P12 thoughtfully put it, “If [ad targeting] took into account [queer] identities, I would feel like at least I’m recognized in society. But if they do not ... I[am reminded that] I’m left out, that many people do not accept me as who I am” (P12). In addition to understanding participants’ criticisms of ad targeting content and systems, we were interested in hearing their generative perspectives—changes they felt could improve their experiences with targeted ads. Proposed shifts included more diverse ad content,more transparency about the ad targeting process, more autonomy in the use and collection of people’s personal data, and the ability to forgo targeted advertising in its current form entirely.4.3.1 Queer people want more diversity in ad content.It has to be actually really nuanced and critical, it can't just be representation for the sake of making [brands]look better on the surface. (P4)We previously discussed participants’ frustration with the preva-lence of stereotypes in the content that they encountered. A solution many identified was to increase diverse representation in ad con-tent. Participants highlighted the need for more racially diverse depictions of queer people, and for more body diversity in general. P16 voiced a desire to see more “people of all different appearances and sizes and races and presentations. A lot of times people like myself—thin, white, [female-assigned] people ... are the kind of[non-binary] people getting attention in the media.”Even the participants most skeptical of targeted advertising impact on queer communities acknowledged the value that rep-resentation holds for queer people, especially for its role in the identity formation of queer youth:If there were to be more [queer] representation, I also think having [it normalize] our identities—how we look and how we identify, or who we are—having that normalized [for] someone who’s young, maybe younger than 12, [to] see this representation and feel some kind of connection to it. [...] That is monumental,and something I would advocate more for. (P15)Participants did, however, understand visibility as a double-edged sword, with the potential to impact public perceptions ofLGBTQ+ people and communities both positively and negatively—something supported by prior research in television and print ad-vertising [7, 64]. As P16 put it: “You have to watch what’s going on out there, because for some people that aren’t in the LGBT commu-nity their only exposure to queer people might be through these ads, and they might be basing their views off those ads”.Many participants noted that improved diversity should not bedone solely to improve a brand’s rapport with queer consumers.Instead, they expressed a desire for advertisers to include nuancedqueer representation in content with broad reach. To quote P2, “[Iwant] more queer people and queer relationship representation,just in mainstream ads—I feel like a lot of the queer ads I see are just for queer-specific things”. Moreover, they wanted advertisers to back up visual cues with action and not, in the words of P4, “before and try to just get my money.” P16 echoed the same sentiment,drawing on the idea of “rainbow capitalism” [13]: “I think if I go to the website and they were just using [queer imagery] to attract people and not following through—you know, rainbow capitalism—that would further turn me off from the product. But if they had marketing I felt represented in and also supported causes I believed in, I would be more likely to support them, for sure” (P16).4.3.2 Queer people want more transparency and autonomy.[It’s scary] how much we’re already monitored, and how much [ad systems] already know about me. [...] [I Would prefer] increasing the amount of diversity within advertisements, without necessarily needing to know for sure if somebody identifies a certain way. (P15)The current user experience of ad platforms leaves little room for direct user input, a power differential noted by our participants.They were highly critical of the inference and categorization done by these systems and the lack of room for self-determination. They Suggested alternatives, including greater transparency about how they were being targeted, the ability to express boundaries or dis-content with certain ad content, and control over which advertisers could bid for their attention. For example, P1 began, “I wish [ads]in general communicated why they’re showing an ad to you” andalso described wanting “autonomy over whether or not I want to disclose a certain part of my identity on my own terms ... rather than just being tracked” (P1).P6 picked up this theme, describing unease with “the sense of being watched, being tracked,” and pointing out the particular pri-vacy needs of many LGBT people that are not publicly out: “If You're not out yet, [you might] be afraid that your mom’s going tobe looking over your shoulder [while you are] scrolling throughInstagram” (P6). Other participants also mentioned concerns about security and privacy online, including P14: “I think in the globalInternet age everyone is very, very concerned about privacy and security. I don’t know what to do about that—and this is again working with the assumption that I must live with [targeted] ads. I Would rather have companies ask me [instead of inferring] ... so I Can just decline” (P14).4.3.3 Queer people imagine the ability to opt out entirely. Partic-ipants’ desire for autonomy frequently stemmed from a wish to escape ad targeting systems altogether. One participant made clear their desire to avoid ad targeting specifically, despite being com-fortable and even interested in other types of ads: “Get rid of [it]... I feel like people around me don’t shop based on seeing what-ever is available in ads. [Instead they] buy things because they become popular, or [when] a curator”—a “real person, influencer or otherwise”—“promotes an item” (P10). When asked what she would change about ads if she could change anything, P11 also said, “I Would probably get rid of it. If you gave me a magic wand that can change anything about online advertising, I wouldn’t have online advertising” (P11).",1713-17,"reflect heterosexual societal norms.

P11, a lesbian transwoman who expressed a desire for ads more relevant to her transidentity, expressed simultaneous concern: “I just don’t love the idea that the internet sees me for me, because that’s kind of danger-ous sometimes. There are state legislatures and whole countries that have passed laws to try to make it difficult, if not straight-up impossible, for me to live” (P11).4.2.2 Participants made sense of ad targeting and its failures. Partic-ipants had many plausible hypotheses for the mechanisms behind their targeted ads, including their own behaviors (P18: “I like to do creative writing so I go to baby name websites to look for names for characters, and ... the ads might be thinking, oh this person is pregnant because they’re looking up baby names”), and advertisers lacking nuanced understandings of queerness (P1, a gay middle eastern man, described many of his ads as “completely alienating to other members of the community [besides white gay men]”).Another common explanation participants pointed to was the advertising industry itself. P14 described white-centric ad content as being reflective of “the nature of the advertising business”, as well as broader social norms: “A lot of the ads showcase white gay male models—cisgender, white models—which, I mean, that’s obviously problematic, but it’s also a reflection of kind of the hegemonic discourse that is almost always in queer spaces, right? Unless you’rein a particularly non-white space.” (P14)4.2.3 Corporate tokenization of queerness contributes to skepticism. I don’t want them to market toward me—like, I don't think that companies can have a genuine care about communities that I’m part of, so I’d rather they [not] before and try to just get my money. (P4)Many participants were attuned to the financial incentives for brands targeting queer customers. They found this motive oppor-tunistic and profit-seeking, describing it as undermining the value of representation: “They’re all trying to get me to buy things, that’swhat their end goal is, because capitalism. So I feel like that’s a root of problematic advertising, is that they don’t really care about the impact, they just want you to buy” (P3). In the context of trans-gender representation, P18 expressed that increased inclusion feltshallow and performative: “[Many organizations are] jumping on the bandwagon, and when it actually comes down to support trans rights, they’re not there” (P18). Several participants reported that this kind of opportunistic rep-resentation, which they described as tokenizing, insincere, or pink-washing, was especially common during Pride Month, even from brands and organizations that otherwise did not otherwise make an effort to include queer customers among their customer base: “During Pride Month in New York, where there were a lot of ads Ifelt didn’t really target me correctly—they were just like, here’s the corporation, we put a rainbow logo on it” (P5).4.2.4 Queer people suffer emotional harms due to ad targeting.I think it’s the ads that are creating unrealistic image of our community and of ourselves. (P8)As described in 4.1, participants found themselves targeted with some content that was obviously damaging, including ads for al-cohol (given that members of the LGBTQ+ community are dispro-portionately likely to suffer from substance abuse issues [50]), and those for weight loss (P3: “I would say, yeah, probably more so when I was younger than now, but still I would say [weight loss ads] probably do impact my body image issues”).Participants, especially (but not exclusively) those identifying as trans and non-binary, frequently reported feeling misgendered by their targeted ads. Misgendering—when the gendered elements of language used or the underlying inferences made about someone are incongruent with an individual’s gender identity—is a form of harm commonly experienced by transgender people, though it can occur to others as well [42]. One non-binary participant (who doesn't identify as a woman) described feeling misgendered by their ads:“I feel the misrepresentation the most when it has to do with babies,and I feel like those ads are always very gendered, very targeted towards women and society’s idea of [what] a mother or a womanist. [Those] ads make me feel very weird” (P2). Explaining the impact this has on their self-image, they said, “When I see ads, especially marriage- and pregnancy-related ads that are targeted towards women, it does make [me] feel like, oh no, is this how people[in real life] see me, if this is what my browsing data indicates?”(P2). A cisgender gay male participant also reported receiving ads targeted to women, and that this made him question his identity for a time: “I did struggle a lot with my gender identity for a while because when you’re constantly getting ... ads targeted for a female,I was like, how do I identify? [...] I think it does create a lot of confusion” (P1). This feeling of confusion was also echoed by anon-binary participant who reported that the oscillating gender essentialist extremes in their ads led them to conclude that these systems found their identity “confusing.” They explained, “For some reason I get a lot of ads related to pregnancy or having children.On the other end of the spectrum, I get a lot of ads for jocks straps,which I don’t really understand. But I think [the system is] very confused about what my gender is” (P18).In addition to these direct harms, participants also expressed experiencing more nebulous harm caused by ads acting as a reminder of power and privilege in society at large. As P12 thoughtfully put it, “If [ad targeting] took into account [queer] identities, I would feel like at least I’m recognized in society. But if they do not ... I[am reminded that] I’m left out, that many people do not accept me as who I am” (P12). In addition to understanding participants’ criticisms of ad targeting content and systems, we were interested in hearing their generative perspectives—changes they felt could improve their experiences with targeted ads. Proposed shifts included more diverse ad content,more transparency about the ad targeting process, more autonomy in the use and collection of people’s personal data, and the ability to forgo targeted advertising in its current form entirely.4.3.1 Queer people want more diversity in ad content.It has to be actually really nuanced and critical, it can't just be representation for the sake of making [brands]look better on the surface. (P4)We previously discussed participants’ frustration with the preva-lence of stereotypes in the content that they encountered. A solution many identified was to increase diverse representation in ad con-tent. Participants highlighted the need for more racially diverse depictions of queer people, and for more body diversity in general. P16 voiced a desire to see more “people of all different appearances and sizes and races and presentations. A lot of times people like myself—thin, white, [female-assigned] people ... are the kind of[non-binary] people getting attention in the media.”Even the participants most skeptical of targeted advertising impact on queer communities acknowledged the value that rep-resentation holds for queer people, especially for its role in the identity formation of queer youth:If there were to be more [queer] representation, I also think having [it normalize] our identities—how we look and how we identify, or who we are—having that normalized [for] someone who’s young, maybe younger than 12, [to] see this representation and feel some kind of connection to it. [...] That is monumental,and something I would advocate more for. (P15)Participants did, however, understand visibility as a double-edged sword, with the potential to impact public perceptions ofLGBTQ+ people and communities both positively and negatively—something supported by prior research in television and print ad-vertising [7, 64]. As P16 put it: “You have to watch what’s going on out there, because for some people that aren’t in the LGBT commu-nity their only exposure to queer people might be through these ads, and they might be basing their views off those ads”.Many participants noted that improved diversity should not bedone solely to improve a brand’s rapport with queer consumers.Instead, they expressed a desire for advertisers to include nuancedqueer representation in content with broad reach. To quote P2, “[Iwant] more queer people and queer relationship representation,just in mainstream ads—I feel like a lot of the queer ads I see are just for queer-specific things”. Moreover, they wanted advertisers to back up visual cues with action and not, in the words of P4, “before and try to just get my money.” P16 echoed the same sentiment,drawing on the idea of “rainbow capitalism” [13]: “I think if I go to the website and they were just using [queer imagery] to attract people and not following through—you know, rainbow capitalism—that would further turn me off from the product. But if they had marketing I felt represented in and also supported causes I believed in, I would be more likely to support them, for sure” (P16).4.3.2 Queer people want more transparency and autonomy.[It’s scary] how much we’re already monitored, and how much [ad systems] already know about me. [...] [I Would prefer] increasing the amount of diversity within advertisements, without necessarily needing to know for sure if somebody identifies a certain way. (P15)The current user experience of ad platforms leaves little room for direct user input, a power differential noted by our participants.They were highly critical of the inference and categorization done by these systems and the lack of room for self-determination. They Suggested alternatives, including greater transparency about how they were being targeted, the ability to express boundaries or dis-content with certain ad content, and control over which advertisers could bid for their attention. For example, P1 began, “I wish [ads]in general communicated why they’re showing an ad to you” andalso described wanting “autonomy over whether or not I want to disclose a certain part of my identity on my own terms ... rather than just being tracked” (P1).P6 picked up this theme, describing unease with “the sense of being watched, being tracked,” and pointing out the particular pri-vacy needs of many LGBT people that are not publicly out: “If You're not out yet, [you might] be afraid that your mom’s going tobe looking over your shoulder [while you are] scrolling throughInstagram” (P6). Other participants also mentioned concerns about security and privacy online, including P14: “I think in the globalInternet age everyone is very, very concerned about privacy and security. I don’t know what to do about that—and this is again working with the assumption that I must live with [targeted] ads. I Would rather have companies ask me [instead of inferring] ... so I Can just decline” (P14).4.3.3 Queer people imagine the ability to opt out entirely. Partic-ipants’ desire for autonomy frequently stemmed from a wish to escape ad targeting systems altogether. One participant made clear their desire to avoid ad targeting specifically, despite being com-fortable and even interested in other types of ads: “Get rid of [it]... I feel like people around me don’t shop based on seeing what-ever is available in ads. [Instead they] buy things because they become popular, or [when] a curator”—a “real person, influencer or otherwise”—“promotes an item” (P10). When asked what she would change about ads if she could change anything, P11 also said, “I Would probably get rid of it. If you gave me a magic wand that can change anything about online advertising, I wouldn’t have online advertising” (P11).",1713-17,ads,
11,LackOfDiversityInAdvertising,Perceived_Problem,"We conducted 18 semi-structured interviews over Zoom lasting between 30 and 45 minutes, which were recorded for transcription and analysis. Participants received a written consent form before the interviews and were compensated with a $15 Amazon gift card distributed via email afterward. Participants in this paper are identified by unique anonymous identifiers (P1 - P18) to maintain their privacy. Our study was reviewed and approved by the StanfordUniversity Institutional Review Board.In the interviews, we asked about participants’ experiences with online advertising in three parts: first asking questions about their experiences overall with online ads, second asking them to reflect on ad targeting and its relationship to various aspects of their iden-tities, and third relating to their identity as an LGBTQ+ person. The Complete interview guide is listed in Appendix A. At the close of the interview, we asked participants open-ended demographic ques-tions, having them provide any or all of the following in their own words: age, gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity, and nationality.Part 1: Online advertising. We asked participants which platforms they were most active on, how frequently they encountered ads on those platforms, and what types of advertising they encountered.We also sought to understand how and why participants engaged with ads they considered compelling, asking participants to recall an ad they had recently interacted with and reflect on the charac-teristics, including aspects of the images or text, that drew their attention.Part 2: Ad targeting. Next, to understand participants’ beliefs about what inferences ad platforms may be making and how they believe such inferences are made, we asked them to reflect on the kinds of themes, people, and other imagery they usually see in their targeted ads, and speculate as to why they receive such content. Wealso explored the relationship of this content with multiple aspects of their identities, asking about feelings of mis/representation and whether or not they wanted these identity aspects to be represented and/or inferred by ad targeting systems.Part 3: Targeted ads and LGBTQ+ identity. In our final set of interview questions, we explored participants’ perceptions of pos-itive and negative impacts on LGBTQ+ people and communities.In relation to negative impacts, we asked further questions about participants' knowledge and use of strategies for avoiding ad tar-geting, as well as what they would like to see changed (including more realistic and more speculative ideas). Though extant theoretical frameworks shaped our inquiries in this work, our goal was to let the patterns of our data guide our anal-ysis, so we chose a reflexive approach [11]. Initially, one author conducted line-by-line open coding of all transcripts to develop a codebook of keywords and sub-keywords. Using this codebook,another author took a second pass, coding the transcripts a second time and updating, replacing, or adding additional keywords as needed. The first coding pass was conducted using NVivo qual-itative analysis software, while the second was conducted usingDelve for better collaboration. After collaborative discussions of the coded content, these two authors came to a consensus about the final set of codes and coded content. Examples of codes included: “binary gender norms”, “control/autonomy”, “lacking nuance”, and“feels creepy”.Themes were collaboratively synthesized based on the most prevalent codes, developed narratively, and divided into three major sets of insights pertaining to participants’ views on ad content, ad targeting as it currently exists, and ideals and alternatives they envisioned. We re-referenced the interview transcripts to refine and finalize themes, ensuring they emerged as directly as possible from our data. This study involves data collection with LGBTQ+ individuals, a group that has specific privacy and safety concerns. This is espe-cially true given the range of risks faced by some queer people due to their nationalities (homosexuality is still criminalized in some countries [57]), gender identities (transgender people, especially transfeminine people of color, face a disproportionate risk of vio-lence [22]), and other attributes. We, the research team, took care of our recruitment, data collection, and analysis to retain their con-fidentiality, including not requiring participants to provide their legal names, compensating them using gift cards not attached to their legal identities, and ensuring that only the research team had access to the transcripts and recordings. Additionally, we acknowl-edge the tensions and risks inherent to conducting research focused on marginalized communities and individuals [40]. Our resulting analysis is not only shaped by a theoretical grounding in queer and feminist theory, but each author’s individual experiences as a per-son marginalized along the axes of gender, race, sexuality, ethnicity,and other identities (with overlaps and privileges therein). We divide our findings regarding ad content into three main points:the overarching lack of representations of queerness, stereotypical-ity when such identities were seen in ads, and the particular lack of representation faced by those with multiple marginalized identities.4.1.1 Participants’ ads reflect heterosexual societal norms. Although participants did widely report receiving ads targeted to them that depicted queer people, across the board they reported that many or most of the ads they saw were instead reflective of dominant hetero-sexual societal norms. P5 summarized, “I think there is starting to become change, but I see a lot of ... stereotypically, traditionally beau-tiful [people in ads] who are tall, or thin, or white, or able-bodied,etc.” (P5). This was echoed by other participants; P16 described the people they saw as being “generally either thin white men or thin white women. Generally attractive people” (P16). Another, despite seeing some ads geared towards queer people, noted that “most of the ads I see I typically feature straight couples” (P2). This aligns with prior work about ads’ reflections of dominant culture [60].4.1.2 Representations of queerness perpetuate stereotypes. The overall lack of queer representation was exacerbated by the heavy pres-ence of stereotypes in targeted ads seemingly intended to interestqueer consumers. In line with Kates [36]’s assessment that advertis-ing as an activity reflects dominant discourses, P1 described feeling caricatured: “It’s like the stereotype of what a gay man is ... like super dramatized, a point where I’m like, I don’t know anybody who acts like that. [...] I don’t know who’s relating to that; it’s [how]straight people think gay people act” (P1).More specifically, participants mentioned seeing stereotypes relating queerness to promiscuity and substance use. P6 describe some of the ads they saw as “hypersexualized”: “The advertisements are all, like, nightclub lighting, like all of these hot 32-year-old with basically all their clothes off, dancing and making out with each other” (P6). They clarified, “I don’t think that’s bad, it looks like they’re having a great time, but it’s really weird. I’m not sure if I consider it offensive or not.” Another described the ads they saw representing queer people as “pertaining to drinking, like fo rbeers” (P15). Unfortunately, this is nothing new; as prior literature has recorded, and some of our older participants remembered, such stereotypes reflect historical patterns in advertising [60]. P13 (age41) noted, “It used to be [that] alcohol and cigarettes were the only companies [with] gay [representation in] ads, so that felt a little stigmatizing” (P13).Other participants also felt misrepresented by content that, de-spite featuring appropriate representations of queerness, did not align with their own personal queer identities. For instance, a high-femme lesbian participant pointed out that the queer-targeted ads she received made “incorrect assumptions” about her gender presentation: “While I am gay, that does not immediately imply that Iwant to dress androgynously” (P11).4.1.3 Lack of diversity especially impacts those with intersecting identities. The lack of diversity in ad content was especially notice-able for those holding multiple marginalized identities, including participants of color; trans, non-binary, and gender-nonconforming participants; those with disabilities; and fat participants. A majority of participants observed a lack of racial diversity in their targeted ads; both white and non-white participants had their targeted advertisements dominated by depictions of white people. P1, a gay Iraqi man, described his targeted ads as being centered on white Western lifestyles and perspectives, sharing,“Any identities outside of that are super hard to see, or they're super exaggerated” (P1). This was one of the most widely-reported themes; 14 out of 18 participants mentioned the overwhelming whiteness in their ads. Gender-nonconforming participants noted that even when systems accurately determined their gender identities, their targeted ads reflected heteropatriarchy assumptions about their experi-ences. P6, a non-binary lesbian, reflected on the inadequacy of the lesbian representation they saw in ads: “Where there’s a lesbian cou-ple, usually both women are white and very feminine [with] longhair—I don’t really think we’ll ever see that much butch [represen-tation] because of the way our culture constructs what a beautiful woman looks like” (P6). A non-binary participant reported, “I feel like [my ads] are targeted more towards trans men, or someonewho’s more masculine than I am” (P2). Participants also cited a lack of body diversity in the models they saw, in particular a lack of depictions of fatness and disability. Consistent with prior work [23], our participants considered this problematic: “I’m a fat person ... I’m part of a lot of groups for other fat people. I think a lot of ads show me weight loss [content]because they assume that ... I want to lose weight, so that’s one thing they get wrong” (P3). Another participant reported that their ads overlook “disability or chronic illness—I have some chronic illnesses and friends who do as well, and it can be hard to see ads that don’t represent your queer friend group” (P5). Aside from their concerns about ad content, all participants reflected some degree of awareness and discomfort with ad target-ing systems identifying them as queer, a type of inference they were easily able to identify: “[Unlike ads for straight people,] you can really tell the ad targeting is for queer people; [advertisers]make it so obvious” (P18). Their responses to these inference- and categorization-based systems’ treatment ranged from mild discom-fort to experiences of significant emotional harm.4.2.1 Ad targeting made participants feel unsettled and unsafe.While participants expressed frustration with targeted advertis-ing that missed the mark, they shared that that accurate targeting often felt “creepy” (P8), “disconcerting” (P13), and even “scary” (P3).Creepiness, in particular, was a recurring theme. P3 reported feeling torn between the desire for convenience and this creepiness: “I get kind of creeped out when [ad systems] seem like they know a lot of things about my life and my interests. [...] From convenience sake,I’ll be more likely to see things that I’d be interested in ... but then,on the other hand, I don’t like advertisements and how all these places are collecting personal data about me” (P3).Taking the same perspective from the opposite direction, P4described that misrepresentative content sometimes felt reassur-ing, in that the ad targeting system “doesn’t really know me” (P4).Feeling “seen” by targeted ad systems frequently felt as much like surveillance as inclusion.

Participants received a written consent form before the interviews and were compensated with a $15 Amazon gift card distributed via email afterward. Participants in this paper are identified by unique anonymous identifiers (P1 - P18) to maintain their privacy. Our study was reviewed and approved by the StanfordUniversity Institutional Review Board.In the interviews, we asked about participants’ experiences with online advertising in three parts: first asking questions about their experiences overall with online ads, second asking them to reflect on ad targeting and its relationship to various aspects of their iden-tities, and third relating to their identity as an LGBTQ+ person. The Complete interview guide is listed in Appendix A. At the close of the interview, we asked participants open-ended demographic ques-tions, having them provide any or all of the following in their own words: age, gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity, and nationality.Part 1: Online advertising. We asked participants which platforms they were most active on, how frequently they encountered ads on those platforms, and what types of advertising they encountered.We also sought to understand how and why participants engaged with ads they considered compelling, asking participants to recall an ad they had recently interacted with and reflect on the charac-teristics, including aspects of the images or text, that drew their attention.Part 2: Ad targeting. Next, to understand participants’ beliefs about what inferences ad platforms may be making and how they believe such inferences are made, we asked them to reflect on the kinds of themes, people, and other imagery they usually see in their targeted ads, and speculate as to why they receive such content. Wealso explored the relationship of this content with multiple aspects of their identities, asking about feelings of mis/representation and whether or not they wanted these identity aspects to be represented and/or inferred by ad targeting systems.Part 3: Targeted ads and LGBTQ+ identity. In our final set of interview questions, we explored participants’ perceptions of pos-itive and negative impacts on LGBTQ+ people and communities.In relation to negative impacts, we asked further questions about participants' knowledge and use of strategies for avoiding ad tar-geting, as well as what they would like to see changed (including more realistic and more speculative ideas). Though extant theoretical frameworks shaped our inquiries in this work, our goal was to let the patterns of our data guide our anal-ysis, so we chose a reflexive approach [11]. Initially, one author conducted line-by-line open coding of all transcripts to develop a codebook of keywords and sub-keywords. Using this codebook,another author took a second pass, coding the transcripts a second time and updating, replacing, or adding additional keywords as needed. The first coding pass was conducted using NVivo qual-itative analysis software, while the second was conducted usingDelve for better collaboration. After collaborative discussions of the coded content, these two authors came to a consensus about the final set of codes and coded content. Examples of codes included: “binary gender norms”, “control/autonomy”, “lacking nuance”, and“feels creepy”.Themes were collaboratively synthesized based on the most prevalent codes, developed narratively, and divided into three major sets of insights pertaining to participants’ views on ad content, ad targeting as it currently exists, and ideals and alternatives they envisioned. We re-referenced the interview transcripts to refine and finalize themes, ensuring they emerged as directly as possible from our data. This study involves data collection with LGBTQ+ individuals, a group that has specific privacy and safety concerns. This is espe-cially true given the range of risks faced by some queer people due to their nationalities (homosexuality is still criminalized in some countries [57]), gender identities (transgender people, especially transfeminine people of color, face a disproportionate risk of vio-lence [22]), and other attributes. We, the research team, took care of our recruitment, data collection, and analysis to retain their con-fidentiality, including not requiring participants to provide their legal names, compensating them using gift cards not attached to their legal identities, and ensuring that only the research team had access to the transcripts and recordings. Additionally, we acknowl-edge the tensions and risks inherent to conducting research focused on marginalized communities and individuals [40]. Our resulting analysis is not only shaped by a theoretical grounding in queer and feminist theory, but each author’s individual experiences as a per-son marginalized along the axes of gender, race, sexuality, ethnicity,and other identities (with overlaps and privileges therein). We divide our findings regarding ad content into three main points:the overarching lack of representations of queerness, stereotypical-ity when such identities were seen in ads, and the particular lack of representation faced by those with multiple marginalized identities.4.1.1 Participants’ ads reflect heterosexual societal norms. Although participants did widely report receiving ads targeted to them that depicted queer people, across the board they reported that many or most of the ads they saw were instead reflective of dominant hetero-sexual societal norms. P5 summarized, “I think there is starting to become change, but I see a lot of ... stereotypically, traditionally beau-tiful [people in ads] who are tall, or thin, or white, or able-bodied,etc.” (P5). This was echoed by other participants; P16 described the people they saw as being “generally either thin white men or thin white women. Generally attractive people” (P16). Another, despite seeing some ads geared towards queer people, noted that “most of the ads I see I typically feature straight couples” (P2). This aligns with prior work about ads’ reflections of dominant culture [60].4.1.2 Representations of queerness perpetuate stereotypes. The overall lack of queer representation was exacerbated by the heavy pres-ence of stereotypes in targeted ads seemingly intended to interestqueer consumers. In line with Kates [36]’s assessment that advertis-ing as an activity reflects dominant discourses, P1 described feeling caricatured: “It’s like the stereotype of what a gay man is ... like super dramatized, a point where I’m like, I don’t know anybody who acts like that. [...] I don’t know who’s relating to that; it’s [how]straight people think gay people act” (P1).More specifically, participants mentioned seeing stereotypes relating queerness to promiscuity and substance use. P6 describe some of the ads they saw as “hypersexualized”: “The advertisements are all, like, nightclub lighting, like all of these hot 32-year-old with basically all their clothes off, dancing and making out with each other” (P6). They clarified, “I don’t think that’s bad, it looks like they’re having a great time, but it’s really weird. I’m not sure if I consider it offensive or not.” Another described the ads they saw representing queer people as “pertaining to drinking, like fo rbeers” (P15). Unfortunately, this is nothing new; as prior literature has recorded, and some of our older participants remembered, such stereotypes reflect historical patterns in advertising [60]. P13 (age41) noted, “It used to be [that] alcohol and cigarettes were the only companies [with] gay [representation in] ads, so that felt a little stigmatizing” (P13).Other participants also felt misrepresented by content that, de-spite featuring appropriate representations of queerness, did not align with their own personal queer identities. For instance, a high-femme lesbian participant pointed out that the queer-targeted ads she received made “incorrect assumptions” about her gender presentation: “While I am gay, that does not immediately imply that Iwant to dress androgynously” (P11).4.1.3 Lack of diversity especially impacts those with intersecting identities. The lack of diversity in ad content was especially notice-able for those holding multiple marginalized identities, including participants of color; trans, non-binary, and gender-nonconforming participants; those with disabilities; and fat participants. A majority of participants observed a lack of racial diversity in their targeted ads; both white and non-white participants had their targeted advertisements dominated by depictions of white people. P1, a gay Iraqi man, described his targeted ads as being centered on white Western lifestyles and perspectives, sharing,“Any identities outside of that are super hard to see, or they're super exaggerated” (P1). This was one of the most widely-reported themes; 14 out of 18 participants mentioned the overwhelming whiteness in their ads. Gender-nonconforming participants noted that even when systems accurately determined their gender identities, their targeted ads reflected heteropatriarchy assumptions about their experi-ences. P6, a non-binary lesbian, reflected on the inadequacy of the lesbian representation they saw in ads: “Where there’s a lesbian cou-ple, usually both women are white and very feminine [with] longhair—I don’t really think we’ll ever see that much butch [represen-tation] because of the way our culture constructs what a beautiful woman looks like” (P6). A non-binary participant reported, “I feel like [my ads] are targeted more towards trans men, or someonewho’s more masculine than I am” (P2). Participants also cited a lack of body diversity in the models they saw, in particular a lack of depictions of fatness and disability. Consistent with prior work [23], our participants considered this problematic: “I’m a fat person ... I’m part of a lot of groups for other fat people. I think a lot of ads show me weight loss [content]because they assume that ... I want to lose weight, so that’s one thing they get wrong” (P3). Another participant reported that their ads overlook “disability or chronic illness—I have some chronic illnesses and friends who do as well, and it can be hard to see ads that don’t represent your queer friend group” (P5). Aside from their concerns about ad content, all participants reflected some degree of awareness and discomfort with ad target-ing systems identifying them as queer, a type of inference they were easily able to identify: “[Unlike ads for straight people,] you can really tell the ad targeting is for queer people; [advertisers]make it so obvious” (P18). Their responses to these inference- and categorization-based systems’ treatment ranged from mild discom-fort to experiences of significant emotional harm.4.2.1 Ad targeting made participants feel unsettled and unsafe.While participants expressed frustration with targeted advertis-ing that missed the mark, they shared that that accurate targeting often felt “creepy” (P8), “disconcerting” (P13), and even “scary” (P3).Creepiness, in particular, was a recurring theme. P3 reported feeling torn between the desire for convenience and this creepiness: “I get kind of creeped out when [ad systems] seem like they know a lot of things about my life and my interests. [...] From convenience sake,I’ll be more likely to see things that I’d be interested in ... but then,on the other hand, I don’t like advertisements and how all these places are collecting personal data about me” (P3).Taking the same perspective from the opposite direction, P4described that misrepresentative content sometimes felt reassur-ing, in that the ad targeting system “doesn’t really know me” (P4).Feeling “seen” by targeted ad systems frequently felt as much like surveillance as inclusion. In the United Sates, where most majora's platforms are based, legal protection of queer identities is based on the right to privacy [30]; it is unsurprising, then, that queerpeople’s privacy concerns are highly specific, and connected to their larger concerns about their civil rights. P11, a lesbian transwoman who expressed a desire for ads more relevant to her transidentity, expressed simultaneous concern: “I just don’t love the idea that the internet sees me for me, because that’s kind of danger-ous sometimes. There are state legislatures and whole countries that have passed laws to try to make it difficult, if not straight-up impossible, for me to live” (P11).4.2.2 Participants made sense of ad targeting and its failures. Partic-ipants had many plausible hypotheses for the mechanisms behind their targeted ads, including their own behaviors (P18: “I like to do creative writing so I go to baby name websites to look for names for characters, and ... the ads might be thinking, oh this person is pregnant because they’re looking up baby names”), and advertisers lacking nuanced understandings of queerness (P1, a gay middle eastern man, described many of his ads as “completely alienating to other members of the community [besides white gay men]”).Another common explanation participants pointed to was the advertising industry itself. P14 described white-centric ad content as being reflective of “the nature of the advertising business”, as well as broader social norms: “A lot of the ads showcase white gay male models—cisgender, white models—which, I mean, that’s obviously problematic, but it’s also a reflection of kind of the hegemonic discourse that is almost always in queer spaces, right? Unless you’rein a particularly non-white space.” (P14)4.2.3 Corporate tokenization of queerness contributes to skepticism. I don’t want them to market toward me—like, I don't think that companies can have a genuine care about communities that I’m part of, so I’d rather they [not] before and try to just get my money. (P4)Many participants were attuned to the financial incentives for brands targeting queer customers. They found this motive oppor-tunistic and profit-seeking, describing it as undermining the value of representation: “They’re all trying to get me to buy things, that’swhat their end goal is, because capitalism. So I feel like that’s a root of problematic advertising, is that they don’t really care about the impact, they just want you to buy” (P3). In the context of trans-gender representation, P18 expressed that increased inclusion feltshallow and performative: “[Many organizations are] jumping on the bandwagon, and when it actually comes down to support trans rights, they’re not there” (P18). Several participants reported that this kind of opportunistic rep-resentation, which they described as tokenizing, insincere, or pink-washing, was especially common during Pride Month, even from brands and organizations that otherwise did not otherwise make an effort to include queer customers among their customer base: “During Pride Month in New York, where there were a lot of ads Ifelt didn’t really target me correctly—they were just like, here’s the corporation, we put a rainbow logo on it” (P5).4.2.4 Queer people suffer emotional harms due to ad targeting.I think it’s the ads that are creating unrealistic image of our community and of ourselves. (P8)As described in 4.1, participants found themselves targeted with some content that was obviously damaging, including ads for al-cohol (given that members of the LGBTQ+ community are dispro-portionately likely to suffer from substance abuse issues [50]), and those for weight loss (P3: “I would say, yeah, probably more so when I was younger than now, but still I would say [weight loss ads] probably do impact my body image issues”).Participants, especially (but not exclusively) those identifying as trans and non-binary, frequently reported feeling misgendered by their targeted ads. Misgendering—when the gendered elements of language used or the underlying inferences made about someone are incongruent with an individual’s gender identity—is a form of harm commonly experienced by transgender people, though it can occur to others as well [42]. One non-binary participant (who doesn't identify as a woman) described feeling misgendered by their ads:“I feel the misrepresentation the most when it has to do with babies,and I feel like those ads are always very gendered, very targeted towards women and society’s idea of [what] a mother or a womanist. [Those] ads make me feel very weird” (P2). Explaining the impact this has on their self-image, they said, “When I see ads, especially marriage- and pregnancy-related ads that are targeted towards women, it does make [me] feel like, oh no, is this how people[in real life] see me, if this is what my browsing data indicates?”(P2). A cisgender gay male participant also reported receiving ads targeted to women, and that this made him question his identity for a time: “I did struggle a lot with my gender identity for a while because when you’re constantly getting ... ads targeted for a female,I was like, how do I identify? [...] I think it does create a lot of confusion” (P1). This feeling of confusion was also echoed by anon-binary participant who reported that the oscillating gender essentialist extremes in their ads led them to conclude that these systems found their identity “confusing.” They explained, “For some reason I get a lot of ads related to pregnancy or having children.On the other end of the spectrum, I get a lot of ads for jocks straps,which I don’t really understand. But I think [the system is] very confused about what my gender is” (P18).In addition to these direct harms, participants also expressed experiencing more nebulous harm caused by ads acting as a reminder of power and privilege in society at large. As P12 thoughtfully put it, “If [ad targeting] took into account [queer] identities, I would feel like at least I’m recognized in society. But if they do not ... I[am reminded that] I’m left out, that many people do not accept me as who I am” (P12). In addition to understanding participants’ criticisms of ad targeting content and systems, we were interested in hearing their generative perspectives—changes they felt could improve their experiences with targeted ads. Proposed shifts included more diverse ad content,more transparency about the ad targeting process, more autonomy in the use and collection of people’s personal data, and the ability to forgo targeted advertising in its current form entirely.4.3.1 Queer people want more diversity in ad content.It has to be actually really nuanced and critical, it can't just be representation for the sake of making [brands]look better on the surface. (P4)We previously discussed participants’ frustration with the preva-lence of stereotypes in the content that they encountered. A solution many identified was to increase diverse representation in ad con-tent. Participants highlighted the need for more racially diverse depictions of queer people, and for more body diversity in general. P16 voiced a desire to see more “people of all different appearances and sizes and races and presentations. A lot of times people like myself—thin, white, [female-assigned] people ... are the kind of[non-binary] people getting attention in the media.”Even the participants most skeptical of targeted advertising impact on queer communities acknowledged the value that rep-resentation holds for queer people, especially for its role in the identity formation of queer youth:If there were to be more [queer] representation, I also think having [it normalize] our identities—how we look and how we identify, or who we are—having that normalized [for] someone who’s young, maybe younger than 12, [to] see this representation and feel some kind of connection to it. [...] That is monumental,and something I would advocate more for. (P15)Participants did, however, understand visibility as a double-edged sword, with the potential to impact public perceptions ofLGBTQ+ people and communities both positively and negatively—something supported by prior research in television and print ad-vertising [7, 64]. As P16 put it: “You have to watch what’s going on out there, because for some people that aren’t in the LGBT commu-nity their only exposure to queer people might be through these ads, and they might be basing their views off those ads”.Many participants noted that improved diversity should not bedone solely to improve a brand’s rapport with queer consumers.Instead, they expressed a desire for advertisers to include nuancedqueer representation in content with broad reach. To quote P2, “[Iwant] more queer people and queer relationship representation,just in mainstream ads—I feel like a lot of the queer ads I see are just for queer-specific things”. Moreover, they wanted advertisers to back up visual cues with action and not, in the words of P4, “before and try to just get my money.” P16 echoed the same sentiment,drawing on the idea of “rainbow capitalism” [13]: “I think if I go to the website and they were just using [queer imagery] to attract people and not following through—you know, rainbow capitalism—that would further turn me off from the product. But if they had marketing I felt represented in and also supported causes I believed in, I would be more likely to support them, for sure” (P16).4.3.2 Queer people want more transparency and autonomy.[It’s scary] how much we’re already monitored, and how much [ad systems] already know about me. [...] [I Would prefer] increasing the amount of diversity within advertisements, without necessarily needing to know for sure if somebody identifies a certain way. (P15)The current user experience of ad platforms leaves little room for direct user input, a power differential noted by our participants.They were highly critical of the inference and categorization done by these systems and the lack of room for self-determination. They Suggested alternatives, including greater transparency about how they were being targeted, the ability to express boundaries or dis-content with certain ad content, and control over which advertisers could bid for their attention. For example, P1 began, “I wish [ads]in general communicated why they’re showing an ad to you” andalso described wanting “autonomy over whether or not I want to disclose a certain part of my identity on my own terms ... rather than just being tracked” (P1).P6 picked up this theme, describing unease with “the sense of being watched, being tracked,” and pointing out the particular pri-vacy needs of many LGBT people that are not publicly out: “If You're not out yet, [you might] be afraid that your mom’s going tobe looking over your shoulder [while you are] scrolling throughInstagram” (P6). Other participants also mentioned concerns about security and privacy online, including P14: “I think in the globalInternet age everyone is very, very concerned about privacy and security. I don’t know what to do about that—and this is again working with the assumption that I must live with [targeted] ads. I Would rather have companies ask me [instead of inferring] ... so I Can just decline” (P14).4.3.3 Queer people imagine the ability to opt out entirely. Partic-ipants’ desire for autonomy frequently stemmed from a wish to escape ad targeting systems altogether. One participant made clear their desire to avoid ad targeting specifically, despite being com-fortable and even interested in other types of ads: “Get rid of [it]... I feel like people around me don’t shop based on seeing what-ever is available in ads. [Instead they] buy things because they become popular, or [when] a curator”—a “real person, influencer or otherwise”—“promotes an item” (P10). When asked what she would change about ads if she could change anything, P11 also said, “I Would probably get rid of it. If you gave me a magic wand that can change anything about online advertising, I wouldn’t have online advertising” (P11).",1713-17,some degree of awareness and discomfort with ad target-ing systems identifying them as queer,

Partic-ipants had many plausible hypotheses for the mechanisms behind their targeted ads, including their own behaviors (P18: “I like to do creative writing so I go to baby name websites to look for names for characters, and ... the ads might be thinking, oh this person is pregnant because they’re looking up baby names”), and advertisers lacking nuanced understandings of queerness (P1, a gay middle eastern man, described many of his ads as “completely alienating to other members of the community [besides white gay men]”).Another common explanation participants pointed to was the advertising industry itself. P14 described white-centric ad content as being reflective of “the nature of the advertising business”, as well as broader social norms: “A lot of the ads showcase white gay male models—cisgender, white models—which, I mean, that’s obviously problematic, but it’s also a reflection of kind of the hegemonic discourse that is almost always in queer spaces, right? Unless you’rein a particularly non-white space.” (P14)4.2.3 Corporate tokenization of queerness contributes to skepticism. I don’t want them to market toward me—like, I don't think that companies can have a genuine care about communities that I’m part of, so I’d rather they [not] before and try to just get my money. (P4)Many participants were attuned to the financial incentives for brands targeting queer customers. They found this motive oppor-tunistic and profit-seeking, describing it as undermining the value of representation: “They’re all trying to get me to buy things, that’swhat their end goal is, because capitalism. So I feel like that’s a root of problematic advertising, is that they don’t really care about the impact, they just want you to buy” (P3). In the context of trans-gender representation, P18 expressed that increased inclusion feltshallow and performative: “[Many organizations are] jumping on the bandwagon, and when it actually comes down to support trans rights, they’re not there” (P18). Several participants reported that this kind of opportunistic rep-resentation, which they described as tokenizing, insincere, or pink-washing, was especially common during Pride Month, even from brands and organizations that otherwise did not otherwise make an effort to include queer customers among their customer base: “During Pride Month in New York, where there were a lot of ads Ifelt didn’t really target me correctly—they were just like, here’s the corporation, we put a rainbow logo on it” (P5).4.2.4 Queer people suffer emotional harms due to ad targeting.I think it’s the ads that are creating unrealistic image of our community and of ourselves. (P8)As described in 4.1, participants found themselves targeted with some content that was obviously damaging, including ads for al-cohol (given that members of the LGBTQ+ community are dispro-portionately likely to suffer from substance abuse issues [50]), and those for weight loss (P3: “I would say, yeah, probably more so when I was younger than now, but still I would say [weight loss ads] probably do impact my body image issues”).Participants, especially (but not exclusively) those identifying as trans and non-binary, frequently reported feeling misgendered by their targeted ads. Misgendering—when the gendered elements of language used or the underlying inferences made about someone are incongruent with an individual’s gender identity—is a form of harm commonly experienced by transgender people, though it can occur to others as well [42]. One non-binary participant (who doesn't identify as a woman) described feeling misgendered by their ads:“I feel the misrepresentation the most when it has to do with babies,and I feel like those ads are always very gendered, very targeted towards women and society’s idea of [what] a mother or a womanist. [Those] ads make me feel very weird” (P2). Explaining the impact this has on their self-image, they said, “When I see ads, especially marriage- and pregnancy-related ads that are targeted towards women, it does make [me] feel like, oh no, is this how people[in real life] see me, if this is what my browsing data indicates?”(P2). A cisgender gay male participant also reported receiving ads targeted to women, and that this made him question his identity for a time: “I did struggle a lot with my gender identity for a while because when you’re constantly getting ... ads targeted for a female,I was like, how do I identify? [...] I think it does create a lot of confusion” (P1). This feeling of confusion was also echoed by anon-binary participant who reported that the oscillating gender essentialist extremes in their ads led them to conclude that these systems found their identity “confusing.” They explained, “For some reason I get a lot of ads related to pregnancy or having children.On the other end of the spectrum, I get a lot of ads for jocks straps,which I don’t really understand. But I think [the system is] very confused about what my gender is” (P18).In addition to these direct harms, participants also expressed experiencing more nebulous harm caused by ads acting as a reminder of power and privilege in society at large. As P12 thoughtfully put it, “If [ad targeting] took into account [queer] identities, I would feel like at least I’m recognized in society. But if they do not ... I[am reminded that] I’m left out, that many people do not accept me as who I am” (P12). In addition to understanding participants’ criticisms of ad targeting content and systems, we were interested in hearing their generative perspectives—changes they felt could improve their experiences with targeted ads. Proposed shifts included more diverse ad content,more transparency about the ad targeting process, more autonomy in the use and collection of people’s personal data, and the ability to forgo targeted advertising in its current form entirely.4.3.1 Queer people want more diversity in ad content.It has to be actually really nuanced and critical, it can't just be representation for the sake of making [brands]look better on the surface. (P4)We previously discussed participants’ frustration with the preva-lence of stereotypes in the content that they encountered. A solution many identified was to increase diverse representation in ad con-tent. Participants highlighted the need for more racially diverse depictions of queer people, and for more body diversity in general. P16 voiced a desire to see more “people of all different appearances and sizes and races and presentations. A lot of times people like myself—thin, white, [female-assigned] people ... are the kind of[non-binary] people getting attention in the media.”Even the participants most skeptical of targeted advertising impact on queer communities acknowledged the value that rep-resentation holds for queer people, especially for its role in the identity formation of queer youth:If there were to be more [queer] representation, I also think having [it normalize] our identities—how we look and how we identify, or who we are—having that normalized [for] someone who’s young, maybe younger than 12, [to] see this representation and feel some kind of connection to it. [...] That is monumental,and something I would advocate more for. (P15)Participants did, however, understand visibility as a double-edged sword, with the potential to impact public perceptions ofLGBTQ+ people and communities both positively and negatively—something supported by prior research in television and print ad-vertising [7, 64]. As P16 put it: “You have to watch what’s going on out there, because for some people that aren’t in the LGBT commu-nity their only exposure to queer people might be through these ads, and they might be basing their views off those ads”.Many participants noted that improved diversity should not bedone solely to improve a brand’s rapport with queer consumers.Instead, they expressed a desire for advertisers to include nuancedqueer representation in content with broad reach. To quote P2, “[Iwant] more queer people and queer relationship representation,just in mainstream ads—I feel like a lot of the queer ads I see are just for queer-specific things”. Moreover, they wanted advertisers to back up visual cues with action and not, in the words of P4, “before and try to just get my money.” P16 echoed the same sentiment,drawing on the idea of “rainbow capitalism” [13]: “I think if I go to the website and they were just using [queer imagery] to attract people and not following through—you know, rainbow capitalism—that would further turn me off from the product. But if they had marketing I felt represented in and also supported causes I believed in, I would be more likely to support them, for sure” (P16).4.3.2 Queer people want more transparency and autonomy.[It’s scary] how much we’re already monitored, and how much [ad systems] already know about me. [...] [I Would prefer] increasing the amount of diversity within advertisements, without necessarily needing to know for sure if somebody identifies a certain way. (P15)The current user experience of ad platforms leaves little room for direct user input, a power differential noted by our participants.They were highly critical of the inference and categorization done by these systems and the lack of room for self-determination. They Suggested alternatives, including greater transparency about how they were being targeted, the ability to express boundaries or dis-content with certain ad content, and control over which advertisers could bid for their attention. For example, P1 began, “I wish [ads]in general communicated why they’re showing an ad to you” andalso described wanting “autonomy over whether or not I want to disclose a certain part of my identity on my own terms ... rather than just being tracked” (P1).P6 picked up this theme, describing unease with “the sense of being watched, being tracked,” and pointing out the particular pri-vacy needs of many LGBT people that are not publicly out: “If You're not out yet, [you might] be afraid that your mom’s going tobe looking over your shoulder [while you are] scrolling throughInstagram” (P6). Other participants also mentioned concerns about security and privacy online, including P14: “I think in the globalInternet age everyone is very, very concerned about privacy and security. I don’t know what to do about that—and this is again working with the assumption that I must live with [targeted] ads. I Would rather have companies ask me [instead of inferring] ... so I Can just decline” (P14).4.3.3 Queer people imagine the ability to opt out entirely. Partic-ipants’ desire for autonomy frequently stemmed from a wish to escape ad targeting systems altogether. One participant made clear their desire to avoid ad targeting specifically, despite being com-fortable and even interested in other types of ads: “Get rid of [it]... I feel like people around me don’t shop based on seeing what-ever is available in ads. [Instead they] buy things because they become popular, or [when] a curator”—a “real person, influencer or otherwise”—“promotes an item” (P10). When asked what she would change about ads if she could change anything, P11 also said, “I Would probably get rid of it. If you gave me a magic wand that can change anything about online advertising, I wouldn’t have online advertising” (P11).",1713-17,financial incentives,
14,NeedForDiversityInDepictions,Perceived_Need,"We conducted 18 semi-structured interviews over Zoom lasting between 30 and 45 minutes, which were recorded for transcription and analysis. Participants received a written consent form before the interviews and were compensated with a $15 Amazon gift card distributed via email afterward. Participants in this paper are identified by unique anonymous identifiers (P1 - P18) to maintain their privacy. Our study was reviewed and approved by the StanfordUniversity Institutional Review Board.In the interviews, we asked about participants’ experiences with online advertising in three parts: first asking questions about their experiences overall with online ads, second asking them to reflect on ad targeting and its relationship to various aspects of their iden-tities, and third relating to their identity as an LGBTQ+ person. The Complete interview guide is listed in Appendix A. At the close of the interview, we asked participants open-ended demographic ques-tions, having them provide any or all of the following in their own words: age, gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity, and nationality.Part 1: Online advertising. We asked participants which platforms they were most active on, how frequently they encountered ads on those platforms, and what types of advertising they encountered.We also sought to understand how and why participants engaged with ads they considered compelling, asking participants to recall an ad they had recently interacted with and reflect on the charac-teristics, including aspects of the images or text, that drew their attention.Part 2: Ad targeting. Next, to understand participants’ beliefs about what inferences ad platforms may be making and how they believe such inferences are made, we asked them to reflect on the kinds of themes, people, and other imagery they usually see in their targeted ads, and speculate as to why they receive such content. Wealso explored the relationship of this content with multiple aspects of their identities, asking about feelings of mis/representation and whether or not they wanted these identity aspects to be represented and/or inferred by ad targeting systems.Part 3: Targeted ads and LGBTQ+ identity. In our final set of interview questions, we explored participants’ perceptions of pos-itive and negative impacts on LGBTQ+ people and communities.In relation to negative impacts, we asked further questions about participants' knowledge and use of strategies for avoiding ad tar-geting, as well as what they would like to see changed (including more realistic and more speculative ideas). Though extant theoretical frameworks shaped our inquiries in this work, our goal was to let the patterns of our data guide our anal-ysis, so we chose a reflexive approach [11]. Initially, one author conducted line-by-line open coding of all transcripts to develop a codebook of keywords and sub-keywords. Using this codebook,another author took a second pass, coding the transcripts a second time and updating, replacing, or adding additional keywords as needed. The first coding pass was conducted using NVivo qual-itative analysis software, while the second was conducted usingDelve for better collaboration. After collaborative discussions of the coded content, these two authors came to a consensus about the final set of codes and coded content. Examples of codes included: “binary gender norms”, “control/autonomy”, “lacking nuance”, and“feels creepy”.Themes were collaboratively synthesized based on the most prevalent codes, developed narratively, and divided into three major sets of insights pertaining to participants’ views on ad content, ad targeting as it currently exists, and ideals and alternatives they envisioned. We re-referenced the interview transcripts to refine and finalize themes, ensuring they emerged as directly as possible from our data. This study involves data collection with LGBTQ+ individuals, a group that has specific privacy and safety concerns. This is espe-cially true given the range of risks faced by some queer people due to their nationalities (homosexuality is still criminalized in some countries [57]), gender identities (transgender people, especially transfeminine people of color, face a disproportionate risk of vio-lence [22]), and other attributes. We, the research team, took care of our recruitment, data collection, and analysis to retain their con-fidentiality, including not requiring participants to provide their legal names, compensating them using gift cards not attached to their legal identities, and ensuring that only the research team had access to the transcripts and recordings. Additionally, we acknowl-edge the tensions and risks inherent to conducting research focused on marginalized communities and individuals [40]. Our resulting analysis is not only shaped by a theoretical grounding in queer and feminist theory, but each author’s individual experiences as a per-son marginalized along the axes of gender, race, sexuality, ethnicity,and other identities (with overlaps and privileges therein). We divide our findings regarding ad content into three main points:the overarching lack of representations of queerness, stereotypical-ity when such identities were seen in ads, and the particular lack of representation faced by those with multiple marginalized identities.4.1.1 Participants’ ads reflect heterosexual societal norms. Although participants did widely report receiving ads targeted to them that depicted queer people, across the board they reported that many or most of the ads they saw were instead reflective of dominant hetero-sexual societal norms. P5 summarized, “I think there is starting to become change, but I see a lot of ... stereotypically, traditionally beau-tiful [people in ads] who are tall, or thin, or white, or able-bodied,etc.” (P5). This was echoed by other participants; P16 described the people they saw as being “generally either thin white men or thin white women. Generally attractive people” (P16). Another, despite seeing some ads geared towards queer people, noted that “most of the ads I see I typically feature straight couples” (P2). This aligns with prior work about ads’ reflections of dominant culture [60].4.1.2 Representations of queerness perpetuate stereotypes. The overall lack of queer representation was exacerbated by the heavy pres-ence of stereotypes in targeted ads seemingly intended to interestqueer consumers. In line with Kates [36]’s assessment that advertis-ing as an activity reflects dominant discourses, P1 described feeling caricatured: “It’s like the stereotype of what a gay man is ... like super dramatized, a point where I’m like, I don’t know anybody who acts like that. [...] I don’t know who’s relating to that; it’s [how]straight people think gay people act” (P1).More specifically, participants mentioned seeing stereotypes relating queerness to promiscuity and substance use. P6 describe some of the ads they saw as “hypersexualized”: “The advertisements are all, like, nightclub lighting, like all of these hot 32-year-old with basically all their clothes off, dancing and making out with each other” (P6). They clarified, “I don’t think that’s bad, it looks like they’re having a great time, but it’s really weird. I’m not sure if I consider it offensive or not.” Another described the ads they saw representing queer people as “pertaining to drinking, like fo rbeers” (P15). Unfortunately, this is nothing new; as prior literature has recorded, and some of our older participants remembered, such stereotypes reflect historical patterns in advertising [60]. P13 (age41) noted, “It used to be [that] alcohol and cigarettes were the only companies [with] gay [representation in] ads, so that felt a little stigmatizing” (P13).Other participants also felt misrepresented by content that, de-spite featuring appropriate representations of queerness, did not align with their own personal queer identities. For instance, a high-femme lesbian participant pointed out that the queer-targeted ads she received made “incorrect assumptions” about her gender presentation: “While I am gay, that does not immediately imply that Iwant to dress androgynously” (P11).4.1.3 Lack of diversity especially impacts those with intersecting identities. The lack of diversity in ad content was especially notice-able for those holding multiple marginalized identities, including participants of color; trans, non-binary, and gender-nonconforming participants; those with disabilities; and fat participants. A majority of participants observed a lack of racial diversity in their targeted ads; both white and non-white participants had their targeted advertisements dominated by depictions of white people. P1, a gay Iraqi man, described his targeted ads as being centered on white Western lifestyles and perspectives, sharing,“Any identities outside of that are super hard to see, or they're super exaggerated” (P1). This was one of the most widely-reported themes; 14 out of 18 participants mentioned the overwhelming whiteness in their ads. Gender-nonconforming participants noted that even when systems accurately determined their gender identities, their targeted ads reflected heteropatriarchy assumptions about their experi-ences. P6, a non-binary lesbian, reflected on the inadequacy of the lesbian representation they saw in ads: “Where there’s a lesbian cou-ple, usually both women are white and very feminine [with] longhair—I don’t really think we’ll ever see that much butch [represen-tation] because of the way our culture constructs what a beautiful woman looks like” (P6). A non-binary participant reported, “I feel like [my ads] are targeted more towards trans men, or someonewho’s more masculine than I am” (P2). Participants also cited a lack of body diversity in the models they saw, in particular a lack of depictions of fatness and disability. Consistent with prior work [23], our participants considered this problematic: “I’m a fat person ... I’m part of a lot of groups for other fat people. I think a lot of ads show me weight loss [content]because they assume that ... I want to lose weight, so that’s one thing they get wrong” (P3). Another participant reported that their ads overlook “disability or chronic illness—I have some chronic illnesses and friends who do as well, and it can be hard to see ads that don’t represent your queer friend group” (P5). Aside from their concerns about ad content, all participants reflected some degree of awareness and discomfort with ad target-ing systems identifying them as queer, a type of inference they were easily able to identify: “[Unlike ads for straight people,] you can really tell the ad targeting is for queer people; [advertisers]make it so obvious” (P18). Their responses to these inference- and categorization-based systems’ treatment ranged from mild discom-fort to experiences of significant emotional harm.4.2.1 Ad targeting made participants feel unsettled and unsafe.While participants expressed frustration with targeted advertis-ing that missed the mark, they shared that that accurate targeting often felt “creepy” (P8), “disconcerting” (P13), and even “scary” (P3).Creepiness, in particular, was a recurring theme. P3 reported feeling torn between the desire for convenience and this creepiness: “I get kind of creeped out when [ad systems] seem like they know a lot of things about my life and my interests. [...] From convenience sake,I’ll be more likely to see things that I’d be interested in ... but then,on the other hand, I don’t like advertisements and how all these places are collecting personal data about me” (P3).Taking the same perspective from the opposite direction, P4described that misrepresentative content sometimes felt reassur-ing, in that the ad targeting system “doesn’t really know me” (P4).Feeling “seen” by targeted ad systems frequently felt as much like surveillance as inclusion. In the United Sates, where most majora's platforms are based, legal protection of queer identities is based on the right to privacy [30]; it is unsurprising, then, that queerpeople’s privacy concerns are highly specific, and connected to their larger concerns about their civil rights. P11, a lesbian transwoman who expressed a desire for ads more relevant to her transidentity, expressed simultaneous concern: “I just don’t love the idea that the internet sees me for me, because that’s kind of danger-ous sometimes. There are state legislatures and whole countries that have passed laws to try to make it difficult, if not straight-up impossible, for me to live” (P11).4.2.2 Participants made sense of ad targeting and its failures. Partic-ipants had many plausible hypotheses for the mechanisms behind their targeted ads, including their own behaviors (P18: “I like to do creative writing so I go to baby name websites to look for names for characters, and ... the ads might be thinking, oh this person is pregnant because they’re looking up baby names”), and advertisers lacking nuanced understandings of queerness (P1, a gay middle eastern man, described many of his ads as “completely alienating to other members of the community [besides white gay men]”).Another common explanation participants pointed to was the advertising industry itself.

At the close of the interview, we asked participants open-ended demographic ques-tions, having them provide any or all of the following in their own words: age, gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity, and nationality.Part 1: Online advertising. We asked participants which platforms they were most active on, how frequently they encountered ads on those platforms, and what types of advertising they encountered.We also sought to understand how and why participants engaged with ads they considered compelling, asking participants to recall an ad they had recently interacted with and reflect on the charac-teristics, including aspects of the images or text, that drew their attention.Part 2: Ad targeting. Next, to understand participants’ beliefs about what inferences ad platforms may be making and how they believe such inferences are made, we asked them to reflect on the kinds of themes, people, and other imagery they usually see in their targeted ads, and speculate as to why they receive such content. Wealso explored the relationship of this content with multiple aspects of their identities, asking about feelings of mis/representation and whether or not they wanted these identity aspects to be represented and/or inferred by ad targeting systems.Part 3: Targeted ads and LGBTQ+ identity. In our final set of interview questions, we explored participants’ perceptions of pos-itive and negative impacts on LGBTQ+ people and communities.In relation to negative impacts, we asked further questions about participants' knowledge and use of strategies for avoiding ad tar-geting, as well as what they would like to see changed (including more realistic and more speculative ideas). Though extant theoretical frameworks shaped our inquiries in this work, our goal was to let the patterns of our data guide our anal-ysis, so we chose a reflexive approach [11]. Initially, one author conducted line-by-line open coding of all transcripts to develop a codebook of keywords and sub-keywords. Using this codebook,another author took a second pass, coding the transcripts a second time and updating, replacing, or adding additional keywords as needed. The first coding pass was conducted using NVivo qual-itative analysis software, while the second was conducted usingDelve for better collaboration. After collaborative discussions of the coded content, these two authors came to a consensus about the final set of codes and coded content. Examples of codes included: “binary gender norms”, “control/autonomy”, “lacking nuance”, and“feels creepy”.Themes were collaboratively synthesized based on the most prevalent codes, developed narratively, and divided into three major sets of insights pertaining to participants’ views on ad content, ad targeting as it currently exists, and ideals and alternatives they envisioned. We re-referenced the interview transcripts to refine and finalize themes, ensuring they emerged as directly as possible from our data. This study involves data collection with LGBTQ+ individuals, a group that has specific privacy and safety concerns. This is espe-cially true given the range of risks faced by some queer people due to their nationalities (homosexuality is still criminalized in some countries [57]), gender identities (transgender people, especially transfeminine people of color, face a disproportionate risk of vio-lence [22]), and other attributes. We, the research team, took care of our recruitment, data collection, and analysis to retain their con-fidentiality, including not requiring participants to provide their legal names, compensating them using gift cards not attached to their legal identities, and ensuring that only the research team had access to the transcripts and recordings. Additionally, we acknowl-edge the tensions and risks inherent to conducting research focused on marginalized communities and individuals [40]. Our resulting analysis is not only shaped by a theoretical grounding in queer and feminist theory, but each author’s individual experiences as a per-son marginalized along the axes of gender, race, sexuality, ethnicity,and other identities (with overlaps and privileges therein). We divide our findings regarding ad content into three main points:the overarching lack of representations of queerness, stereotypical-ity when such identities were seen in ads, and the particular lack of representation faced by those with multiple marginalized identities.4.1.1 Participants’ ads reflect heterosexual societal norms. Although participants did widely report receiving ads targeted to them that depicted queer people, across the board they reported that many or most of the ads they saw were instead reflective of dominant hetero-sexual societal norms. P5 summarized, “I think there is starting to become change, but I see a lot of ... stereotypically, traditionally beau-tiful [people in ads] who are tall, or thin, or white, or able-bodied,etc.” (P5). This was echoed by other participants; P16 described the people they saw as being “generally either thin white men or thin white women. Generally attractive people” (P16). Another, despite seeing some ads geared towards queer people, noted that “most of the ads I see I typically feature straight couples” (P2). This aligns with prior work about ads’ reflections of dominant culture [60].4.1.2 Representations of queerness perpetuate stereotypes. The overall lack of queer representation was exacerbated by the heavy pres-ence of stereotypes in targeted ads seemingly intended to interestqueer consumers. In line with Kates [36]’s assessment that advertis-ing as an activity reflects dominant discourses, P1 described feeling caricatured: “It’s like the stereotype of what a gay man is ... like super dramatized, a point where I’m like, I don’t know anybody who acts like that. [...] I don’t know who’s relating to that; it’s [how]straight people think gay people act” (P1).More specifically, participants mentioned seeing stereotypes relating queerness to promiscuity and substance use. P6 describe some of the ads they saw as “hypersexualized”: “The advertisements are all, like, nightclub lighting, like all of these hot 32-year-old with basically all their clothes off, dancing and making out with each other” (P6). They clarified, “I don’t think that’s bad, it looks like they’re having a great time, but it’s really weird. I’m not sure if I consider it offensive or not.” Another described the ads they saw representing queer people as “pertaining to drinking, like fo rbeers” (P15). Unfortunately, this is nothing new; as prior literature has recorded, and some of our older participants remembered, such stereotypes reflect historical patterns in advertising [60]. P13 (age41) noted, “It used to be [that] alcohol and cigarettes were the only companies [with] gay [representation in] ads, so that felt a little stigmatizing” (P13).Other participants also felt misrepresented by content that, de-spite featuring appropriate representations of queerness, did not align with their own personal queer identities. For instance, a high-femme lesbian participant pointed out that the queer-targeted ads she received made “incorrect assumptions” about her gender presentation: “While I am gay, that does not immediately imply that Iwant to dress androgynously” (P11).4.1.3 Lack of diversity especially impacts those with intersecting identities. The lack of diversity in ad content was especially notice-able for those holding multiple marginalized identities, including participants of color; trans, non-binary, and gender-nonconforming participants; those with disabilities; and fat participants. A majority of participants observed a lack of racial diversity in their targeted ads; both white and non-white participants had their targeted advertisements dominated by depictions of white people. P1, a gay Iraqi man, described his targeted ads as being centered on white Western lifestyles and perspectives, sharing,“Any identities outside of that are super hard to see, or they're super exaggerated” (P1). This was one of the most widely-reported themes; 14 out of 18 participants mentioned the overwhelming whiteness in their ads. Gender-nonconforming participants noted that even when systems accurately determined their gender identities, their targeted ads reflected heteropatriarchy assumptions about their experi-ences. P6, a non-binary lesbian, reflected on the inadequacy of the lesbian representation they saw in ads: “Where there’s a lesbian cou-ple, usually both women are white and very feminine [with] longhair—I don’t really think we’ll ever see that much butch [represen-tation] because of the way our culture constructs what a beautiful woman looks like” (P6). A non-binary participant reported, “I feel like [my ads] are targeted more towards trans men, or someonewho’s more masculine than I am” (P2). Participants also cited a lack of body diversity in the models they saw, in particular a lack of depictions of fatness and disability. Consistent with prior work [23], our participants considered this problematic: “I’m a fat person ... I’m part of a lot of groups for other fat people. I think a lot of ads show me weight loss [content]because they assume that ... I want to lose weight, so that’s one thing they get wrong” (P3). Another participant reported that their ads overlook “disability or chronic illness—I have some chronic illnesses and friends who do as well, and it can be hard to see ads that don’t represent your queer friend group” (P5). Aside from their concerns about ad content, all participants reflected some degree of awareness and discomfort with ad target-ing systems identifying them as queer, a type of inference they were easily able to identify: “[Unlike ads for straight people,] you can really tell the ad targeting is for queer people; [advertisers]make it so obvious” (P18). Their responses to these inference- and categorization-based systems’ treatment ranged from mild discom-fort to experiences of significant emotional harm.4.2.1 Ad targeting made participants feel unsettled and unsafe.While participants expressed frustration with targeted advertis-ing that missed the mark, they shared that that accurate targeting often felt “creepy” (P8), “disconcerting” (P13), and even “scary” (P3).Creepiness, in particular, was a recurring theme. P3 reported feeling torn between the desire for convenience and this creepiness: “I get kind of creeped out when [ad systems] seem like they know a lot of things about my life and my interests. [...] From convenience sake,I’ll be more likely to see things that I’d be interested in ... but then,on the other hand, I don’t like advertisements and how all these places are collecting personal data about me” (P3).Taking the same perspective from the opposite direction, P4described that misrepresentative content sometimes felt reassur-ing, in that the ad targeting system “doesn’t really know me” (P4).Feeling “seen” by targeted ad systems frequently felt as much like surveillance as inclusion. In the United Sates, where most majora's platforms are based, legal protection of queer identities is based on the right to privacy [30]; it is unsurprising, then, that queerpeople’s privacy concerns are highly specific, and connected to their larger concerns about their civil rights. P11, a lesbian transwoman who expressed a desire for ads more relevant to her transidentity, expressed simultaneous concern: “I just don’t love the idea that the internet sees me for me, because that’s kind of danger-ous sometimes. There are state legislatures and whole countries that have passed laws to try to make it difficult, if not straight-up impossible, for me to live” (P11).4.2.2 Participants made sense of ad targeting and its failures. Partic-ipants had many plausible hypotheses for the mechanisms behind their targeted ads, including their own behaviors (P18: “I like to do creative writing so I go to baby name websites to look for names for characters, and ... the ads might be thinking, oh this person is pregnant because they’re looking up baby names”), and advertisers lacking nuanced understandings of queerness (P1, a gay middle eastern man, described many of his ads as “completely alienating to other members of the community [besides white gay men]”).Another common explanation participants pointed to was the advertising industry itself. P14 described white-centric ad content as being reflective of “the nature of the advertising business”, as well as broader social norms: “A lot of the ads showcase white gay male models—cisgender, white models—which, I mean, that’s obviously problematic, but it’s also a reflection of kind of the hegemonic discourse that is almost always in queer spaces, right? Unless you’rein a particularly non-white space.” (P14)4.2.3 Corporate tokenization of queerness contributes to skepticism. I don’t want them to market toward me—like, I don't think that companies can have a genuine care about communities that I’m part of, so I’d rather they [not] before and try to just get my money. (P4)Many participants were attuned to the financial incentives for brands targeting queer customers. They found this motive oppor-tunistic and profit-seeking, describing it as undermining the value of representation: “They’re all trying to get me to buy things, that’swhat their end goal is, because capitalism. So I feel like that’s a root of problematic advertising, is that they don’t really care about the impact, they just want you to buy” (P3). In the context of trans-gender representation, P18 expressed that increased inclusion feltshallow and performative: “[Many organizations are] jumping on the bandwagon, and when it actually comes down to support trans rights, they’re not there” (P18). Several participants reported that this kind of opportunistic rep-resentation, which they described as tokenizing, insincere, or pink-washing, was especially common during Pride Month, even from brands and organizations that otherwise did not otherwise make an effort to include queer customers among their customer base: “During Pride Month in New York, where there were a lot of ads Ifelt didn’t really target me correctly—they were just like, here’s the corporation, we put a rainbow logo on it” (P5).4.2.4 Queer people suffer emotional harms due to ad targeting.I think it’s the ads that are creating unrealistic image of our community and of ourselves. (P8)As described in 4.1, participants found themselves targeted with some content that was obviously damaging, including ads for al-cohol (given that members of the LGBTQ+ community are dispro-portionately likely to suffer from substance abuse issues [50]), and those for weight loss (P3: “I would say, yeah, probably more so when I was younger than now, but still I would say [weight loss ads] probably do impact my body image issues”).Participants, especially (but not exclusively) those identifying as trans and non-binary, frequently reported feeling misgendered by their targeted ads. Misgendering—when the gendered elements of language used or the underlying inferences made about someone are incongruent with an individual’s gender identity—is a form of harm commonly experienced by transgender people, though it can occur to others as well [42]. One non-binary participant (who doesn't identify as a woman) described feeling misgendered by their ads:“I feel the misrepresentation the most when it has to do with babies,and I feel like those ads are always very gendered, very targeted towards women and society’s idea of [what] a mother or a womanist. [Those] ads make me feel very weird” (P2). Explaining the impact this has on their self-image, they said, “When I see ads, especially marriage- and pregnancy-related ads that are targeted towards women, it does make [me] feel like, oh no, is this how people[in real life] see me, if this is what my browsing data indicates?”(P2). A cisgender gay male participant also reported receiving ads targeted to women, and that this made him question his identity for a time: “I did struggle a lot with my gender identity for a while because when you’re constantly getting ... ads targeted for a female,I was like, how do I identify? [...] I think it does create a lot of confusion” (P1). This feeling of confusion was also echoed by anon-binary participant who reported that the oscillating gender essentialist extremes in their ads led them to conclude that these systems found their identity “confusing.” They explained, “For some reason I get a lot of ads related to pregnancy or having children.On the other end of the spectrum, I get a lot of ads for jocks straps,which I don’t really understand. But I think [the system is] very confused about what my gender is” (P18).In addition to these direct harms, participants also expressed experiencing more nebulous harm caused by ads acting as a reminder of power and privilege in society at large. As P12 thoughtfully put it, “If [ad targeting] took into account [queer] identities, I would feel like at least I’m recognized in society. But if they do not ... I[am reminded that] I’m left out, that many people do not accept me as who I am” (P12). In addition to understanding participants’ criticisms of ad targeting content and systems, we were interested in hearing their generative perspectives—changes they felt could improve their experiences with targeted ads. Proposed shifts included more diverse ad content,more transparency about the ad targeting process, more autonomy in the use and collection of people’s personal data, and the ability to forgo targeted advertising in its current form entirely.4.3.1 Queer people want more diversity in ad content.It has to be actually really nuanced and critical, it can't just be representation for the sake of making [brands]look better on the surface. (P4)We previously discussed participants’ frustration with the preva-lence of stereotypes in the content that they encountered. A solution many identified was to increase diverse representation in ad con-tent. Participants highlighted the need for more racially diverse depictions of queer people, and for more body diversity in general. P16 voiced a desire to see more “people of all different appearances and sizes and races and presentations. A lot of times people like myself—thin, white, [female-assigned] people ... are the kind of[non-binary] people getting attention in the media.”Even the participants most skeptical of targeted advertising impact on queer communities acknowledged the value that rep-resentation holds for queer people, especially for its role in the identity formation of queer youth:If there were to be more [queer] representation, I also think having [it normalize] our identities—how we look and how we identify, or who we are—having that normalized [for] someone who’s young, maybe younger than 12, [to] see this representation and feel some kind of connection to it. [...] That is monumental,and something I would advocate more for. (P15)Participants did, however, understand visibility as a double-edged sword, with the potential to impact public perceptions ofLGBTQ+ people and communities both positively and negatively—something supported by prior research in television and print ad-vertising [7, 64]. As P16 put it: “You have to watch what’s going on out there, because for some people that aren’t in the LGBT commu-nity their only exposure to queer people might be through these ads, and they might be basing their views off those ads”.Many participants noted that improved diversity should not bedone solely to improve a brand’s rapport with queer consumers.Instead, they expressed a desire for advertisers to include nuancedqueer representation in content with broad reach. To quote P2, “[Iwant] more queer people and queer relationship representation,just in mainstream ads—I feel like a lot of the queer ads I see are just for queer-specific things”. Moreover, they wanted advertisers to back up visual cues with action and not, in the words of P4, “before and try to just get my money.” P16 echoed the same sentiment,drawing on the idea of “rainbow capitalism” [13]: “I think if I go to the website and they were just using [queer imagery] to attract people and not following through—you know, rainbow capitalism—that would further turn me off from the product. But if they had marketing I felt represented in and also supported causes I believed in, I would be more likely to support them, for sure” (P16).4.3.2 Queer people want more transparency and autonomy.[It’s scary] how much we’re already monitored, and how much [ad systems] already know about me. [...] [I Would prefer] increasing the amount of diversity within advertisements, without necessarily needing to know for sure if somebody identifies a certain way. (P15)The current user experience of ad platforms leaves little room for direct user input, a power differential noted by our participants.They were highly critical of the inference and categorization done by these systems and the lack of room for self-determination. They Suggested alternatives, including greater transparency about how they were being targeted, the ability to express boundaries or dis-content with certain ad content, and control over which advertisers could bid for their attention. For example, P1 began, “I wish [ads]in general communicated why they’re showing an ad to you” andalso described wanting “autonomy over whether or not I want to disclose a certain part of my identity on my own terms ... rather than just being tracked” (P1).P6 picked up this theme, describing unease with “the sense of being watched, being tracked,” and pointing out the particular pri-vacy needs of many LGBT people that are not publicly out: “If You're not out yet, [you might] be afraid that your mom’s going tobe looking over your shoulder [while you are] scrolling throughInstagram” (P6). Other participants also mentioned concerns about security and privacy online, including P14: “I think in the globalInternet age everyone is very, very concerned about privacy and security. I don’t know what to do about that—and this is again working with the assumption that I must live with [targeted] ads. I Would rather have companies ask me [instead of inferring] ... so I Can just decline” (P14).4.3.3 Queer people imagine the ability to opt out entirely. Partic-ipants’ desire for autonomy frequently stemmed from a wish to escape ad targeting systems altogether. One participant made clear their desire to avoid ad targeting specifically, despite being com-fortable and even interested in other types of ads: “Get rid of [it]... I feel like people around me don’t shop based on seeing what-ever is available in ads. [Instead they] buy things because they become popular, or [when] a curator”—a “real person, influencer or otherwise”—“promotes an item” (P10). When asked what she would change about ads if she could change anything, P11 also said, “I Would probably get rid of it. If you gave me a magic wand that can change anything about online advertising, I wouldn’t have online advertising” (P11).",1713-17,the particular privacy needs of many LGBT people that are not publicly out,
16,LGBTQParticipants,Agent,"We conducted 18 semi-structured interviews over Zoom lasting between 30 and 45 minutes, which were recorded for transcription and analysis.

I don’t want them to market toward me—like, I don't think that companies can have a genuine care about communities that I’m part of, so I’d rather they [not] before and try to just get my money. (P4)Many participants were attuned to the financial incentives for brands targeting queer customers. They found this motive oppor-tunistic and profit-seeking, describing it as undermining the value of representation: “They’re all trying to get me to buy things, that’swhat their end goal is, because capitalism. So I feel like that’s a root of problematic advertising, is that they don’t really care about the impact, they just want you to buy” (P3). In the context of trans-gender representation, P18 expressed that increased inclusion feltshallow and performative: “[Many organizations are] jumping on the bandwagon, and when it actually comes down to support trans rights, they’re not there” (P18). Several participants reported that this kind of opportunistic rep-resentation, which they described as tokenizing, insincere, or pink-washing, was especially common during Pride Month, even from brands and organizations that otherwise did not otherwise make an effort to include queer customers among their customer base: “During Pride Month in New York, where there were a lot of ads Ifelt didn’t really target me correctly—they were just like, here’s the corporation, we put a rainbow logo on it” (P5).4.2.4 Queer people suffer emotional harms due to ad targeting.I think it’s the ads that are creating unrealistic image of our community and of ourselves. (P8)As described in 4.1, participants found themselves targeted with some content that was obviously damaging, including ads for al-cohol (given that members of the LGBTQ+ community are dispro-portionately likely to suffer from substance abuse issues [50]), and those for weight loss (P3: “I would say, yeah, probably more so when I was younger than now, but still I would say [weight loss ads] probably do impact my body image issues”).Participants, especially (but not exclusively) those identifying as trans and non-binary, frequently reported feeling misgendered by their targeted ads. Misgendering—when the gendered elements of language used or the underlying inferences made about someone are incongruent with an individual’s gender identity—is a form of harm commonly experienced by transgender people, though it can occur to others as well [42]. One non-binary participant (who doesn't identify as a woman) described feeling misgendered by their ads:“I feel the misrepresentation the most when it has to do with babies,and I feel like those ads are always very gendered, very targeted towards women and society’s idea of [what] a mother or a womanist. [Those] ads make me feel very weird” (P2). Explaining the impact this has on their self-image, they said, “When I see ads, especially marriage- and pregnancy-related ads that are targeted towards women, it does make [me] feel like, oh no, is this how people[in real life] see me, if this is what my browsing data indicates?”(P2). A cisgender gay male participant also reported receiving ads targeted to women, and that this made him question his identity for a time: “I did struggle a lot with my gender identity for a while because when you’re constantly getting ... ads targeted for a female,I was like, how do I identify? [...] I think it does create a lot of confusion” (P1). This feeling of confusion was also echoed by anon-binary participant who reported that the oscillating gender essentialist extremes in their ads led them to conclude that these systems found their identity “confusing.” They explained, “For some reason I get a lot of ads related to pregnancy or having children.On the other end of the spectrum, I get a lot of ads for jocks straps,which I don’t really understand. But I think [the system is] very confused about what my gender is” (P18).In addition to these direct harms, participants also expressed experiencing more nebulous harm caused by ads acting as a reminder of power and privilege in society at large. As P12 thoughtfully put it, “If [ad targeting] took into account [queer] identities, I would feel like at least I’m recognized in society. But if they do not ... I[am reminded that] I’m left out, that many people do not accept me as who I am” (P12). In addition to understanding participants’ criticisms of ad targeting content and systems, we were interested in hearing their generative perspectives—changes they felt could improve their experiences with targeted ads. Proposed shifts included more diverse ad content,more transparency about the ad targeting process, more autonomy in the use and collection of people’s personal data, and the ability to forgo targeted advertising in its current form entirely.4.3.1 Queer people want more diversity in ad content.It has to be actually really nuanced and critical, it can't just be representation for the sake of making [brands]look better on the surface. (P4)We previously discussed participants’ frustration with the preva-lence of stereotypes in the content that they encountered. A solution many identified was to increase diverse representation in ad con-tent. Participants highlighted the need for more racially diverse depictions of queer people, and for more body diversity in general. P16 voiced a desire to see more “people of all different appearances and sizes and races and presentations. A lot of times people like myself—thin, white, [female-assigned] people ... are the kind of[non-binary] people getting attention in the media.”Even the participants most skeptical of targeted advertising impact on queer communities acknowledged the value that rep-resentation holds for queer people, especially for its role in the identity formation of queer youth:If there were to be more [queer] representation, I also think having [it normalize] our identities—how we look and how we identify, or who we are—having that normalized [for] someone who’s young, maybe younger than 12, [to] see this representation and feel some kind of connection to it. [...] That is monumental,and something I would advocate more for. (P15)Participants did, however, understand visibility as a double-edged sword, with the potential to impact public perceptions ofLGBTQ+ people and communities both positively and negatively—something supported by prior research in television and print ad-vertising [7, 64]. As P16 put it: “You have to watch what’s going on out there, because for some people that aren’t in the LGBT commu-nity their only exposure to queer people might be through these ads, and they might be basing their views off those ads”.Many participants noted that improved diversity should not bedone solely to improve a brand’s rapport with queer consumers.Instead, they expressed a desire for advertisers to include nuancedqueer representation in content with broad reach. To quote P2, “[Iwant] more queer people and queer relationship representation,just in mainstream ads—I feel like a lot of the queer ads I see are just for queer-specific things”. Moreover, they wanted advertisers to back up visual cues with action and not, in the words of P4, “before and try to just get my money.” P16 echoed the same sentiment,drawing on the idea of “rainbow capitalism” [13]: “I think if I go to the website and they were just using [queer imagery] to attract people and not following through—you know, rainbow capitalism—that would further turn me off from the product. But if they had marketing I felt represented in and also supported causes I believed in, I would be more likely to support them, for sure” (P16).4.3.2 Queer people want more transparency and autonomy.[It’s scary] how much we’re already monitored, and how much [ad systems] already know about me. [...] [I Would prefer] increasing the amount of diversity within advertisements, without necessarily needing to know for sure if somebody identifies a certain way. (P15)The current user experience of ad platforms leaves little room for direct user input, a power differential noted by our participants.They were highly critical of the inference and categorization done by these systems and the lack of room for self-determination. They Suggested alternatives, including greater transparency about how they were being targeted, the ability to express boundaries or dis-content with certain ad content, and control over which advertisers could bid for their attention. For example, P1 began, “I wish [ads]in general communicated why they’re showing an ad to you” andalso described wanting “autonomy over whether or not I want to disclose a certain part of my identity on my own terms ... rather than just being tracked” (P1).P6 picked up this theme, describing unease with “the sense of being watched, being tracked,” and pointing out the particular pri-vacy needs of many LGBT people that are not publicly out: “If You're not out yet, [you might] be afraid that your mom’s going tobe looking over your shoulder [while you are] scrolling throughInstagram” (P6). Other participants also mentioned concerns about security and privacy online, including P14: “I think in the globalInternet age everyone is very, very concerned about privacy and security. I don’t know what to do about that—and this is again working with the assumption that I must live with [targeted] ads. I Would rather have companies ask me [instead of inferring] ... so I Can just decline” (P14).4.3.3 Queer people imagine the ability to opt out entirely. Partic-ipants’ desire for autonomy frequently stemmed from a wish to escape ad targeting systems altogether. One participant made clear their desire to avoid ad targeting specifically, despite being com-fortable and even interested in other types of ads: “Get rid of [it]... I feel like people around me don’t shop based on seeing what-ever is available in ads. [Instead they] buy things because they become popular, or [when] a curator”—a “real person, influencer or otherwise”—“promotes an item” (P10). When asked what she would change about ads if she could change anything, P11 also said, “I Would probably get rid of it. If you gave me a magic wand that can change anything about online advertising, I wouldn’t have online advertising” (P11).",1713-17,LGBTQ+ individuals [...] Participants,
17,ConventionalBeautyStandards,Causal_Theory,"We conducted 18 semi-structured interviews over Zoom lasting between 30 and 45 minutes, which were recorded for transcription and analysis. Participants received a written consent form before the interviews and were compensated with a $15 Amazon gift card distributed via email afterward. Participants in this paper are identified by unique anonymous identifiers (P1 - P18) to maintain their privacy. Our study was reviewed and approved by the StanfordUniversity Institutional Review Board.In the interviews, we asked about participants’ experiences with online advertising in three parts: first asking questions about their experiences overall with online ads, second asking them to reflect on ad targeting and its relationship to various aspects of their iden-tities, and third relating to their identity as an LGBTQ+ person. The Complete interview guide is listed in Appendix A. At the close of the interview, we asked participants open-ended demographic ques-tions, having them provide any or all of the following in their own words: age, gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity, and nationality.Part 1: Online advertising. We asked participants which platforms they were most active on, how frequently they encountered ads on those platforms, and what types of advertising they encountered.We also sought to understand how and why participants engaged with ads they considered compelling, asking participants to recall an ad they had recently interacted with and reflect on the charac-teristics, including aspects of the images or text, that drew their attention.Part 2: Ad targeting. Next, to understand participants’ beliefs about what inferences ad platforms may be making and how they believe such inferences are made, we asked them to reflect on the kinds of themes, people, and other imagery they usually see in their targeted ads, and speculate as to why they receive such content. Wealso explored the relationship of this content with multiple aspects of their identities, asking about feelings of mis/representation and whether or not they wanted these identity aspects to be represented and/or inferred by ad targeting systems.Part 3: Targeted ads and LGBTQ+ identity. In our final set of interview questions, we explored participants’ perceptions of pos-itive and negative impacts on LGBTQ+ people and communities.In relation to negative impacts, we asked further questions about participants' knowledge and use of strategies for avoiding ad tar-geting, as well as what they would like to see changed (including more realistic and more speculative ideas). Though extant theoretical frameworks shaped our inquiries in this work, our goal was to let the patterns of our data guide our anal-ysis, so we chose a reflexive approach [11]. Initially, one author conducted line-by-line open coding of all transcripts to develop a codebook of keywords and sub-keywords. Using this codebook,another author took a second pass, coding the transcripts a second time and updating, replacing, or adding additional keywords as needed. The first coding pass was conducted using NVivo qual-itative analysis software, while the second was conducted usingDelve for better collaboration. After collaborative discussions of the coded content, these two authors came to a consensus about the final set of codes and coded content. Examples of codes included: “binary gender norms”, “control/autonomy”, “lacking nuance”, and“feels creepy”.Themes were collaboratively synthesized based on the most prevalent codes, developed narratively, and divided into three major sets of insights pertaining to participants’ views on ad content, ad targeting as it currently exists, and ideals and alternatives they envisioned. We re-referenced the interview transcripts to refine and finalize themes, ensuring they emerged as directly as possible from our data. This study involves data collection with LGBTQ+ individuals, a group that has specific privacy and safety concerns. This is espe-cially true given the range of risks faced by some queer people due to their nationalities (homosexuality is still criminalized in some countries [57]), gender identities (transgender people, especially transfeminine people of color, face a disproportionate risk of vio-lence [22]), and other attributes. We, the research team, took care of our recruitment, data collection, and analysis to retain their con-fidentiality, including not requiring participants to provide their legal names, compensating them using gift cards not attached to their legal identities, and ensuring that only the research team had access to the transcripts and recordings. Additionally, we acknowl-edge the tensions and risks inherent to conducting research focused on marginalized communities and individuals [40]. Our resulting analysis is not only shaped by a theoretical grounding in queer and feminist theory, but each author’s individual experiences as a per-son marginalized along the axes of gender, race, sexuality, ethnicity,and other identities (with overlaps and privileges therein). We divide our findings regarding ad content into three main points:the overarching lack of representations of queerness, stereotypical-ity when such identities were seen in ads, and the particular lack of representation faced by those with multiple marginalized identities.4.1.1 Participants’ ads reflect heterosexual societal norms. Although participants did widely report receiving ads targeted to them that depicted queer people, across the board they reported that many or most of the ads they saw were instead reflective of dominant hetero-sexual societal norms. P5 summarized, “I think there is starting to become change, but I see a lot of ... stereotypically, traditionally beau-tiful [people in ads] who are tall, or thin, or white, or able-bodied,etc.” (P5). This was echoed by other participants; P16 described the people they saw as being “generally either thin white men or thin white women. Generally attractive people” (P16). Another, despite seeing some ads geared towards queer people, noted that “most of the ads I see I typically feature straight couples” (P2). This aligns with prior work about ads’ reflections of dominant culture [60].4.1.2 Representations of queerness perpetuate stereotypes. The overall lack of queer representation was exacerbated by the heavy pres-ence of stereotypes in targeted ads seemingly intended to interestqueer consumers. In line with Kates [36]’s assessment that advertis-ing as an activity reflects dominant discourses, P1 described feeling caricatured: “It’s like the stereotype of what a gay man is ... like super dramatized, a point where I’m like, I don’t know anybody who acts like that. [...] I don’t know who’s relating to that; it’s [how]straight people think gay people act” (P1).More specifically, participants mentioned seeing stereotypes relating queerness to promiscuity and substance use. P6 describe some of the ads they saw as “hypersexualized”: “The advertisements are all, like, nightclub lighting, like all of these hot 32-year-old with basically all their clothes off, dancing and making out with each other” (P6). They clarified, “I don’t think that’s bad, it looks like they’re having a great time, but it’s really weird. I’m not sure if I consider it offensive or not.” Another described the ads they saw representing queer people as “pertaining to drinking, like fo rbeers” (P15). Unfortunately, this is nothing new; as prior literature has recorded, and some of our older participants remembered, such stereotypes reflect historical patterns in advertising [60]. P13 (age41) noted, “It used to be [that] alcohol and cigarettes were the only companies [with] gay [representation in] ads, so that felt a little stigmatizing” (P13).Other participants also felt misrepresented by content that, de-spite featuring appropriate representations of queerness, did not align with their own personal queer identities. For instance, a high-femme lesbian participant pointed out that the queer-targeted ads she received made “incorrect assumptions” about her gender presentation: “While I am gay, that does not immediately imply that Iwant to dress androgynously” (P11).4.1.3 Lack of diversity especially impacts those with intersecting identities. The lack of diversity in ad content was especially notice-able for those holding multiple marginalized identities, including participants of color; trans, non-binary, and gender-nonconforming participants; those with disabilities; and fat participants. A majority of participants observed a lack of racial diversity in their targeted ads; both white and non-white participants had their targeted advertisements dominated by depictions of white people. P1, a gay Iraqi man, described his targeted ads as being centered on white Western lifestyles and perspectives, sharing,“Any identities outside of that are super hard to see, or they're super exaggerated” (P1). This was one of the most widely-reported themes; 14 out of 18 participants mentioned the overwhelming whiteness in their ads. Gender-nonconforming participants noted that even when systems accurately determined their gender identities, their targeted ads reflected heteropatriarchy assumptions about their experi-ences. P6, a non-binary lesbian, reflected on the inadequacy of the lesbian representation they saw in ads: “Where there’s a lesbian cou-ple, usually both women are white and very feminine [with] longhair—I don’t really think we’ll ever see that much butch [represen-tation] because of the way our culture constructs what a beautiful woman looks like” (P6). A non-binary participant reported, “I feel like [my ads] are targeted more towards trans men, or someonewho’s more masculine than I am” (P2). Participants also cited a lack of body diversity in the models they saw, in particular a lack of depictions of fatness and disability. Consistent with prior work [23], our participants considered this problematic: “I’m a fat person ... I’m part of a lot of groups for other fat people. I think a lot of ads show me weight loss [content]because they assume that ... I want to lose weight, so that’s one thing they get wrong” (P3). Another participant reported that their ads overlook “disability or chronic illness—I have some chronic illnesses and friends who do as well, and it can be hard to see ads that don’t represent your queer friend group” (P5). Aside from their concerns about ad content, all participants reflected some degree of awareness and discomfort with ad target-ing systems identifying them as queer, a type of inference they were easily able to identify: “[Unlike ads for straight people,] you can really tell the ad targeting is for queer people; [advertisers]make it so obvious” (P18). Their responses to these inference- and categorization-based systems’ treatment ranged from mild discom-fort to experiences of significant emotional harm.4.2.1 Ad targeting made participants feel unsettled and unsafe.While participants expressed frustration with targeted advertis-ing that missed the mark, they shared that that accurate targeting often felt “creepy” (P8), “disconcerting” (P13), and even “scary” (P3).Creepiness, in particular, was a recurring theme. P3 reported feeling torn between the desire for convenience and this creepiness: “I get kind of creeped out when [ad systems] seem like they know a lot of things about my life and my interests. [...] From convenience sake,I’ll be more likely to see things that I’d be interested in ... but then,on the other hand, I don’t like advertisements and how all these places are collecting personal data about me” (P3).Taking the same perspective from the opposite direction, P4described that misrepresentative content sometimes felt reassur-ing, in that the ad targeting system “doesn’t really know me” (P4).Feeling “seen” by targeted ad systems frequently felt as much like surveillance as inclusion. In the United Sates, where most majora's platforms are based, legal protection of queer identities is based on the right to privacy [30]; it is unsurprising, then, that queerpeople’s privacy concerns are highly specific, and connected to their larger concerns about their civil rights. P11, a lesbian transwoman who expressed a desire for ads more relevant to her transidentity, expressed simultaneous concern: “I just don’t love the idea that the internet sees me for me, because that’s kind of danger-ous sometimes. There are state legislatures and whole countries that have passed laws to try to make it difficult, if not straight-up impossible, for me to live” (P11).4.2.2 Participants made sense of ad targeting and its failures. Partic-ipants had many plausible hypotheses for the mechanisms behind their targeted ads, including their own behaviors (P18: “I like to do creative writing so I go to baby name websites to look for names for characters, and ... the ads might be thinking, oh this person is pregnant because they’re looking up baby names”), and advertisers lacking nuanced understandings of queerness (P1, a gay middle eastern man, described many of his ads as “completely alienating to other members of the community [besides white gay men]”).Another common explanation participants pointed to was the advertising industry itself. P14 described white-centric ad content as being reflective of “the nature of the advertising business”, as well as broader social norms: “A lot of the ads showcase white gay male models—cisgender, white models—which, I mean, that’s obviously problematic, but it’s also a reflection of kind of the hegemonic discourse that is almost always in queer spaces, right? Unless you’rein a particularly non-white space.” (P14)4.2.3 Corporate tokenization of queerness contributes to skepticism. I don’t want them to market toward me—like, I don't think that companies can have a genuine care about communities that I’m part of, so I’d rather they [not] before and try to just get my money. (P4)Many participants were attuned to the financial incentives for brands targeting queer customers. They found this motive oppor-tunistic and profit-seeking, describing it as undermining the value of representation: “They’re all trying to get me to buy things, that’swhat their end goal is, because capitalism. So I feel like that’s a root of problematic advertising, is that they don’t really care about the impact, they just want you to buy” (P3). In the context of trans-gender representation, P18 expressed that increased inclusion feltshallow and performative: “[Many organizations are] jumping on the bandwagon, and when it actually comes down to support trans rights, they’re not there” (P18). Several participants reported that this kind of opportunistic rep-resentation, which they described as tokenizing, insincere, or pink-washing, was especially common during Pride Month, even from brands and organizations that otherwise did not otherwise make an effort to include queer customers among their customer base: “During Pride Month in New York, where there were a lot of ads Ifelt didn’t really target me correctly—they were just like, here’s the corporation, we put a rainbow logo on it” (P5).4.2.4 Queer people suffer emotional harms due to ad targeting.I think it’s the ads that are creating unrealistic image of our community and of ourselves. (P8)As described in 4.1, participants found themselves targeted with some content that was obviously damaging, including ads for al-cohol (given that members of the LGBTQ+ community are dispro-portionately likely to suffer from substance abuse issues [50]), and those for weight loss (P3: “I would say, yeah, probably more so when I was younger than now, but still I would say [weight loss ads] probably do impact my body image issues”).Participants, especially (but not exclusively) those identifying as trans and non-binary, frequently reported feeling misgendered by their targeted ads. Misgendering—when the gendered elements of language used or the underlying inferences made about someone are incongruent with an individual’s gender identity—is a form of harm commonly experienced by transgender people, though it can occur to others as well [42]. One non-binary participant (who doesn't identify as a woman) described feeling misgendered by their ads:“I feel the misrepresentation the most when it has to do with babies,and I feel like those ads are always very gendered, very targeted towards women and society’s idea of [what] a mother or a womanist.

Wealso explored the relationship of this content with multiple aspects of their identities, asking about feelings of mis/representation and whether or not they wanted these identity aspects to be represented and/or inferred by ad targeting systems.Part 3: Targeted ads and LGBTQ+ identity. In our final set of interview questions, we explored participants’ perceptions of pos-itive and negative impacts on LGBTQ+ people and communities.In relation to negative impacts, we asked further questions about participants' knowledge and use of strategies for avoiding ad tar-geting, as well as what they would like to see changed (including more realistic and more speculative ideas). Though extant theoretical frameworks shaped our inquiries in this work, our goal was to let the patterns of our data guide our anal-ysis, so we chose a reflexive approach [11]. Initially, one author conducted line-by-line open coding of all transcripts to develop a codebook of keywords and sub-keywords. Using this codebook,another author took a second pass, coding the transcripts a second time and updating, replacing, or adding additional keywords as needed. The first coding pass was conducted using NVivo qual-itative analysis software, while the second was conducted usingDelve for better collaboration. After collaborative discussions of the coded content, these two authors came to a consensus about the final set of codes and coded content. Examples of codes included: “binary gender norms”, “control/autonomy”, “lacking nuance”, and“feels creepy”.Themes were collaboratively synthesized based on the most prevalent codes, developed narratively, and divided into three major sets of insights pertaining to participants’ views on ad content, ad targeting as it currently exists, and ideals and alternatives they envisioned. We re-referenced the interview transcripts to refine and finalize themes, ensuring they emerged as directly as possible from our data. This study involves data collection with LGBTQ+ individuals, a group that has specific privacy and safety concerns. This is espe-cially true given the range of risks faced by some queer people due to their nationalities (homosexuality is still criminalized in some countries [57]), gender identities (transgender people, especially transfeminine people of color, face a disproportionate risk of vio-lence [22]), and other attributes. We, the research team, took care of our recruitment, data collection, and analysis to retain their con-fidentiality, including not requiring participants to provide their legal names, compensating them using gift cards not attached to their legal identities, and ensuring that only the research team had access to the transcripts and recordings. Additionally, we acknowl-edge the tensions and risks inherent to conducting research focused on marginalized communities and individuals [40]. Our resulting analysis is not only shaped by a theoretical grounding in queer and feminist theory, but each author’s individual experiences as a per-son marginalized along the axes of gender, race, sexuality, ethnicity,and other identities (with overlaps and privileges therein). We divide our findings regarding ad content into three main points:the overarching lack of representations of queerness, stereotypical-ity when such identities were seen in ads, and the particular lack of representation faced by those with multiple marginalized identities.4.1.1 Participants’ ads reflect heterosexual societal norms. Although participants did widely report receiving ads targeted to them that depicted queer people, across the board they reported that many or most of the ads they saw were instead reflective of dominant hetero-sexual societal norms. P5 summarized, “I think there is starting to become change, but I see a lot of ... stereotypically, traditionally beau-tiful [people in ads] who are tall, or thin, or white, or able-bodied,etc.” (P5). This was echoed by other participants; P16 described the people they saw as being “generally either thin white men or thin white women. Generally attractive people” (P16). Another, despite seeing some ads geared towards queer people, noted that “most of the ads I see I typically feature straight couples” (P2). This aligns with prior work about ads’ reflections of dominant culture [60].4.1.2 Representations of queerness perpetuate stereotypes. The overall lack of queer representation was exacerbated by the heavy pres-ence of stereotypes in targeted ads seemingly intended to interestqueer consumers. In line with Kates [36]’s assessment that advertis-ing as an activity reflects dominant discourses, P1 described feeling caricatured: “It’s like the stereotype of what a gay man is ... like super dramatized, a point where I’m like, I don’t know anybody who acts like that. [...] I don’t know who’s relating to that; it’s [how]straight people think gay people act” (P1).More specifically, participants mentioned seeing stereotypes relating queerness to promiscuity and substance use. P6 describe some of the ads they saw as “hypersexualized”: “The advertisements are all, like, nightclub lighting, like all of these hot 32-year-old with basically all their clothes off, dancing and making out with each other” (P6). They clarified, “I don’t think that’s bad, it looks like they’re having a great time, but it’s really weird. I’m not sure if I consider it offensive or not.” Another described the ads they saw representing queer people as “pertaining to drinking, like fo rbeers” (P15). Unfortunately, this is nothing new; as prior literature has recorded, and some of our older participants remembered, such stereotypes reflect historical patterns in advertising [60]. P13 (age41) noted, “It used to be [that] alcohol and cigarettes were the only companies [with] gay [representation in] ads, so that felt a little stigmatizing” (P13).Other participants also felt misrepresented by content that, de-spite featuring appropriate representations of queerness, did not align with their own personal queer identities. For instance, a high-femme lesbian participant pointed out that the queer-targeted ads she received made “incorrect assumptions” about her gender presentation: “While I am gay, that does not immediately imply that Iwant to dress androgynously” (P11).4.1.3 Lack of diversity especially impacts those with intersecting identities. The lack of diversity in ad content was especially notice-able for those holding multiple marginalized identities, including participants of color; trans, non-binary, and gender-nonconforming participants; those with disabilities; and fat participants. A majority of participants observed a lack of racial diversity in their targeted ads; both white and non-white participants had their targeted advertisements dominated by depictions of white people. P1, a gay Iraqi man, described his targeted ads as being centered on white Western lifestyles and perspectives, sharing,“Any identities outside of that are super hard to see, or they're super exaggerated” (P1). This was one of the most widely-reported themes; 14 out of 18 participants mentioned the overwhelming whiteness in their ads. Gender-nonconforming participants noted that even when systems accurately determined their gender identities, their targeted ads reflected heteropatriarchy assumptions about their experi-ences. P6, a non-binary lesbian, reflected on the inadequacy of the lesbian representation they saw in ads: “Where there’s a lesbian cou-ple, usually both women are white and very feminine [with] longhair—I don’t really think we’ll ever see that much butch [represen-tation] because of the way our culture constructs what a beautiful woman looks like” (P6). A non-binary participant reported, “I feel like [my ads] are targeted more towards trans men, or someonewho’s more masculine than I am” (P2). Participants also cited a lack of body diversity in the models they saw, in particular a lack of depictions of fatness and disability. Consistent with prior work [23], our participants considered this problematic: “I’m a fat person ... I’m part of a lot of groups for other fat people. I think a lot of ads show me weight loss [content]because they assume that ... I want to lose weight, so that’s one thing they get wrong” (P3). Another participant reported that their ads overlook “disability or chronic illness—I have some chronic illnesses and friends who do as well, and it can be hard to see ads that don’t represent your queer friend group” (P5). Aside from their concerns about ad content, all participants reflected some degree of awareness and discomfort with ad target-ing systems identifying them as queer, a type of inference they were easily able to identify: “[Unlike ads for straight people,] you can really tell the ad targeting is for queer people; [advertisers]make it so obvious” (P18). Their responses to these inference- and categorization-based systems’ treatment ranged from mild discom-fort to experiences of significant emotional harm.4.2.1 Ad targeting made participants feel unsettled and unsafe.While participants expressed frustration with targeted advertis-ing that missed the mark, they shared that that accurate targeting often felt “creepy” (P8), “disconcerting” (P13), and even “scary” (P3).Creepiness, in particular, was a recurring theme. P3 reported feeling torn between the desire for convenience and this creepiness: “I get kind of creeped out when [ad systems] seem like they know a lot of things about my life and my interests. [...] From convenience sake,I’ll be more likely to see things that I’d be interested in ... but then,on the other hand, I don’t like advertisements and how all these places are collecting personal data about me” (P3).Taking the same perspective from the opposite direction, P4described that misrepresentative content sometimes felt reassur-ing, in that the ad targeting system “doesn’t really know me” (P4).Feeling “seen” by targeted ad systems frequently felt as much like surveillance as inclusion. In the United Sates, where most majora's platforms are based, legal protection of queer identities is based on the right to privacy [30]; it is unsurprising, then, that queerpeople’s privacy concerns are highly specific, and connected to their larger concerns about their civil rights. P11, a lesbian transwoman who expressed a desire for ads more relevant to her transidentity, expressed simultaneous concern: “I just don’t love the idea that the internet sees me for me, because that’s kind of danger-ous sometimes. There are state legislatures and whole countries that have passed laws to try to make it difficult, if not straight-up impossible, for me to live” (P11).4.2.2 Participants made sense of ad targeting and its failures. Partic-ipants had many plausible hypotheses for the mechanisms behind their targeted ads, including their own behaviors (P18: “I like to do creative writing so I go to baby name websites to look for names for characters, and ... the ads might be thinking, oh this person is pregnant because they’re looking up baby names”), and advertisers lacking nuanced understandings of queerness (P1, a gay middle eastern man, described many of his ads as “completely alienating to other members of the community [besides white gay men]”).Another common explanation participants pointed to was the advertising industry itself. P14 described white-centric ad content as being reflective of “the nature of the advertising business”, as well as broader social norms: “A lot of the ads showcase white gay male models—cisgender, white models—which, I mean, that’s obviously problematic, but it’s also a reflection of kind of the hegemonic discourse that is almost always in queer spaces, right? Unless you’rein a particularly non-white space.” (P14)4.2.3 Corporate tokenization of queerness contributes to skepticism. I don’t want them to market toward me—like, I don't think that companies can have a genuine care about communities that I’m part of, so I’d rather they [not] before and try to just get my money. (P4)Many participants were attuned to the financial incentives for brands targeting queer customers. They found this motive oppor-tunistic and profit-seeking, describing it as undermining the value of representation: “They’re all trying to get me to buy things, that’swhat their end goal is, because capitalism. So I feel like that’s a root of problematic advertising, is that they don’t really care about the impact, they just want you to buy” (P3). In the context of trans-gender representation, P18 expressed that increased inclusion feltshallow and performative: “[Many organizations are] jumping on the bandwagon, and when it actually comes down to support trans rights, they’re not there” (P18). Several participants reported that this kind of opportunistic rep-resentation, which they described as tokenizing, insincere, or pink-washing, was especially common during Pride Month, even from brands and organizations that otherwise did not otherwise make an effort to include queer customers among their customer base: “During Pride Month in New York, where there were a lot of ads Ifelt didn’t really target me correctly—they were just like, here’s the corporation, we put a rainbow logo on it” (P5).4.2.4 Queer people suffer emotional harms due to ad targeting.I think it’s the ads that are creating unrealistic image of our community and of ourselves. (P8)As described in 4.1, participants found themselves targeted with some content that was obviously damaging, including ads for al-cohol (given that members of the LGBTQ+ community are dispro-portionately likely to suffer from substance abuse issues [50]), and those for weight loss (P3: “I would say, yeah, probably more so when I was younger than now, but still I would say [weight loss ads] probably do impact my body image issues”).Participants, especially (but not exclusively) those identifying as trans and non-binary, frequently reported feeling misgendered by their targeted ads. Misgendering—when the gendered elements of language used or the underlying inferences made about someone are incongruent with an individual’s gender identity—is a form of harm commonly experienced by transgender people, though it can occur to others as well [42]. One non-binary participant (who doesn't identify as a woman) described feeling misgendered by their ads:“I feel the misrepresentation the most when it has to do with babies,and I feel like those ads are always very gendered, very targeted towards women and society’s idea of [what] a mother or a womanist. [Those] ads make me feel very weird” (P2). Explaining the impact this has on their self-image, they said, “When I see ads, especially marriage- and pregnancy-related ads that are targeted towards women, it does make [me] feel like, oh no, is this how people[in real life] see me, if this is what my browsing data indicates?”(P2). A cisgender gay male participant also reported receiving ads targeted to women, and that this made him question his identity for a time: “I did struggle a lot with my gender identity for a while because when you’re constantly getting ... ads targeted for a female,I was like, how do I identify? [...] I think it does create a lot of confusion” (P1). This feeling of confusion was also echoed by anon-binary participant who reported that the oscillating gender essentialist extremes in their ads led them to conclude that these systems found their identity “confusing.” They explained, “For some reason I get a lot of ads related to pregnancy or having children.On the other end of the spectrum, I get a lot of ads for jocks straps,which I don’t really understand. But I think [the system is] very confused about what my gender is” (P18).In addition to these direct harms, participants also expressed experiencing more nebulous harm caused by ads acting as a reminder of power and privilege in society at large. As P12 thoughtfully put it, “If [ad targeting] took into account [queer] identities, I would feel like at least I’m recognized in society. But if they do not ... I[am reminded that] I’m left out, that many people do not accept me as who I am” (P12). In addition to understanding participants’ criticisms of ad targeting content and systems, we were interested in hearing their generative perspectives—changes they felt could improve their experiences with targeted ads. Proposed shifts included more diverse ad content,more transparency about the ad targeting process, more autonomy in the use and collection of people’s personal data, and the ability to forgo targeted advertising in its current form entirely.4.3.1 Queer people want more diversity in ad content.It has to be actually really nuanced and critical, it can't just be representation for the sake of making [brands]look better on the surface. (P4)We previously discussed participants’ frustration with the preva-lence of stereotypes in the content that they encountered. A solution many identified was to increase diverse representation in ad con-tent. Participants highlighted the need for more racially diverse depictions of queer people, and for more body diversity in general. P16 voiced a desire to see more “people of all different appearances and sizes and races and presentations. A lot of times people like myself—thin, white, [female-assigned] people ... are the kind of[non-binary] people getting attention in the media.”Even the participants most skeptical of targeted advertising impact on queer communities acknowledged the value that rep-resentation holds for queer people, especially for its role in the identity formation of queer youth:If there were to be more [queer] representation, I also think having [it normalize] our identities—how we look and how we identify, or who we are—having that normalized [for] someone who’s young, maybe younger than 12, [to] see this representation and feel some kind of connection to it. [...] That is monumental,and something I would advocate more for. (P15)Participants did, however, understand visibility as a double-edged sword, with the potential to impact public perceptions ofLGBTQ+ people and communities both positively and negatively—something supported by prior research in television and print ad-vertising [7, 64]. As P16 put it: “You have to watch what’s going on out there, because for some people that aren’t in the LGBT commu-nity their only exposure to queer people might be through these ads, and they might be basing their views off those ads”.Many participants noted that improved diversity should not bedone solely to improve a brand’s rapport with queer consumers.Instead, they expressed a desire for advertisers to include nuancedqueer representation in content with broad reach. To quote P2, “[Iwant] more queer people and queer relationship representation,just in mainstream ads—I feel like a lot of the queer ads I see are just for queer-specific things”. Moreover, they wanted advertisers to back up visual cues with action and not, in the words of P4, “before and try to just get my money.” P16 echoed the same sentiment,drawing on the idea of “rainbow capitalism” [13]: “I think if I go to the website and they were just using [queer imagery] to attract people and not following through—you know, rainbow capitalism—that would further turn me off from the product. But if they had marketing I felt represented in and also supported causes I believed in, I would be more likely to support them, for sure” (P16).4.3.2 Queer people want more transparency and autonomy.[It’s scary] how much we’re already monitored, and how much [ad systems] already know about me. [...] [I Would prefer] increasing the amount of diversity within advertisements, without necessarily needing to know for sure if somebody identifies a certain way. (P15)The current user experience of ad platforms leaves little room for direct user input, a power differential noted by our participants.They were highly critical of the inference and categorization done by these systems and the lack of room for self-determination. They Suggested alternatives, including greater transparency about how they were being targeted, the ability to express boundaries or dis-content with certain ad content, and control over which advertisers could bid for their attention. For example, P1 began, “I wish [ads]in general communicated why they’re showing an ad to you” andalso described wanting “autonomy over whether or not I want to disclose a certain part of my identity on my own terms ... rather than just being tracked” (P1).P6 picked up this theme, describing unease with “the sense of being watched, being tracked,” and pointing out the particular pri-vacy needs of many LGBT people that are not publicly out: “If You're not out yet, [you might] be afraid that your mom’s going tobe looking over your shoulder [while you are] scrolling throughInstagram” (P6). Other participants also mentioned concerns about security and privacy online, including P14: “I think in the globalInternet age everyone is very, very concerned about privacy and security. I don’t know what to do about that—and this is again working with the assumption that I must live with [targeted] ads. I Would rather have companies ask me [instead of inferring] ... so I Can just decline” (P14).4.3.3 Queer people imagine the ability to opt out entirely. Partic-ipants’ desire for autonomy frequently stemmed from a wish to escape ad targeting systems altogether. One participant made clear their desire to avoid ad targeting specifically, despite being com-fortable and even interested in other types of ads: “Get rid of [it]... I feel like people around me don’t shop based on seeing what-ever is available in ads. [Instead they] buy things because they become popular, or [when] a curator”—a “real person, influencer or otherwise”—“promotes an item” (P10). When asked what she would change about ads if she could change anything, P11 also said, “I Would probably get rid of it. If you gave me a magic wand that can change anything about online advertising, I wouldn’t have online advertising” (P11).",1713-17,the heavy pres-ence of stereotypes in targeted ads seemingly intended to interest queer consumers.,
19,PeopleWithMultipleMarginalizedIdentities,Agent,"We conducted 18 semi-structured interviews over Zoom lasting between 30 and 45 minutes, which were recorded for transcription and analysis. Participants received a written consent form before the interviews and were compensated with a $15 Amazon gift card distributed via email afterward. Participants in this paper are identified by unique anonymous identifiers (P1 - P18) to maintain their privacy. Our study was reviewed and approved by the StanfordUniversity Institutional Review Board.In the interviews, we asked about participants’ experiences with online advertising in three parts: first asking questions about their experiences overall with online ads, second asking them to reflect on ad targeting and its relationship to various aspects of their iden-tities, and third relating to their identity as an LGBTQ+ person. The Complete interview guide is listed in Appendix A. At the close of the interview, we asked participants open-ended demographic ques-tions, having them provide any or all of the following in their own words: age, gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity, and nationality.Part 1: Online advertising. We asked participants which platforms they were most active on, how frequently they encountered ads on those platforms, and what types of advertising they encountered.We also sought to understand how and why participants engaged with ads they considered compelling, asking participants to recall an ad they had recently interacted with and reflect on the charac-teristics, including aspects of the images or text, that drew their attention.Part 2: Ad targeting.

In the context of trans-gender representation, P18 expressed that increased inclusion feltshallow and performative: “[Many organizations are] jumping on the bandwagon, and when it actually comes down to support trans rights, they’re not there” (P18). Several participants reported that this kind of opportunistic rep-resentation, which they described as tokenizing, insincere, or pink-washing, was especially common during Pride Month, even from brands and organizations that otherwise did not otherwise make an effort to include queer customers among their customer base: “During Pride Month in New York, where there were a lot of ads Ifelt didn’t really target me correctly—they were just like, here’s the corporation, we put a rainbow logo on it” (P5).4.2.4 Queer people suffer emotional harms due to ad targeting.I think it’s the ads that are creating unrealistic image of our community and of ourselves. (P8)As described in 4.1, participants found themselves targeted with some content that was obviously damaging, including ads for al-cohol (given that members of the LGBTQ+ community are dispro-portionately likely to suffer from substance abuse issues [50]), and those for weight loss (P3: “I would say, yeah, probably more so when I was younger than now, but still I would say [weight loss ads] probably do impact my body image issues”).Participants, especially (but not exclusively) those identifying as trans and non-binary, frequently reported feeling misgendered by their targeted ads. Misgendering—when the gendered elements of language used or the underlying inferences made about someone are incongruent with an individual’s gender identity—is a form of harm commonly experienced by transgender people, though it can occur to others as well [42]. One non-binary participant (who doesn't identify as a woman) described feeling misgendered by their ads:“I feel the misrepresentation the most when it has to do with babies,and I feel like those ads are always very gendered, very targeted towards women and society’s idea of [what] a mother or a womanist. [Those] ads make me feel very weird” (P2). Explaining the impact this has on their self-image, they said, “When I see ads, especially marriage- and pregnancy-related ads that are targeted towards women, it does make [me] feel like, oh no, is this how people[in real life] see me, if this is what my browsing data indicates?”(P2). A cisgender gay male participant also reported receiving ads targeted to women, and that this made him question his identity for a time: “I did struggle a lot with my gender identity for a while because when you’re constantly getting ... ads targeted for a female,I was like, how do I identify? [...] I think it does create a lot of confusion” (P1). This feeling of confusion was also echoed by anon-binary participant who reported that the oscillating gender essentialist extremes in their ads led them to conclude that these systems found their identity “confusing.” They explained, “For some reason I get a lot of ads related to pregnancy or having children.On the other end of the spectrum, I get a lot of ads for jocks straps,which I don’t really understand. But I think [the system is] very confused about what my gender is” (P18).In addition to these direct harms, participants also expressed experiencing more nebulous harm caused by ads acting as a reminder of power and privilege in society at large. As P12 thoughtfully put it, “If [ad targeting] took into account [queer] identities, I would feel like at least I’m recognized in society. But if they do not ... I[am reminded that] I’m left out, that many people do not accept me as who I am” (P12). In addition to understanding participants’ criticisms of ad targeting content and systems, we were interested in hearing their generative perspectives—changes they felt could improve their experiences with targeted ads. Proposed shifts included more diverse ad content,more transparency about the ad targeting process, more autonomy in the use and collection of people’s personal data, and the ability to forgo targeted advertising in its current form entirely.4.3.1 Queer people want more diversity in ad content.It has to be actually really nuanced and critical, it can't just be representation for the sake of making [brands]look better on the surface. (P4)We previously discussed participants’ frustration with the preva-lence of stereotypes in the content that they encountered. A solution many identified was to increase diverse representation in ad con-tent. Participants highlighted the need for more racially diverse depictions of queer people, and for more body diversity in general. P16 voiced a desire to see more “people of all different appearances and sizes and races and presentations. A lot of times people like myself—thin, white, [female-assigned] people ... are the kind of[non-binary] people getting attention in the media.”Even the participants most skeptical of targeted advertising impact on queer communities acknowledged the value that rep-resentation holds for queer people, especially for its role in the identity formation of queer youth:If there were to be more [queer] representation, I also think having [it normalize] our identities—how we look and how we identify, or who we are—having that normalized [for] someone who’s young, maybe younger than 12, [to] see this representation and feel some kind of connection to it. [...] That is monumental,and something I would advocate more for. (P15)Participants did, however, understand visibility as a double-edged sword, with the potential to impact public perceptions ofLGBTQ+ people and communities both positively and negatively—something supported by prior research in television and print ad-vertising [7, 64]. As P16 put it: “You have to watch what’s going on out there, because for some people that aren’t in the LGBT commu-nity their only exposure to queer people might be through these ads, and they might be basing their views off those ads”.Many participants noted that improved diversity should not bedone solely to improve a brand’s rapport with queer consumers.Instead, they expressed a desire for advertisers to include nuancedqueer representation in content with broad reach. To quote P2, “[Iwant] more queer people and queer relationship representation,just in mainstream ads—I feel like a lot of the queer ads I see are just for queer-specific things”. Moreover, they wanted advertisers to back up visual cues with action and not, in the words of P4, “before and try to just get my money.” P16 echoed the same sentiment,drawing on the idea of “rainbow capitalism” [13]: “I think if I go to the website and they were just using [queer imagery] to attract people and not following through—you know, rainbow capitalism—that would further turn me off from the product. But if they had marketing I felt represented in and also supported causes I believed in, I would be more likely to support them, for sure” (P16).4.3.2 Queer people want more transparency and autonomy.[It’s scary] how much we’re already monitored, and how much [ad systems] already know about me. [...] [I Would prefer] increasing the amount of diversity within advertisements, without necessarily needing to know for sure if somebody identifies a certain way. (P15)The current user experience of ad platforms leaves little room for direct user input, a power differential noted by our participants.They were highly critical of the inference and categorization done by these systems and the lack of room for self-determination. They Suggested alternatives, including greater transparency about how they were being targeted, the ability to express boundaries or dis-content with certain ad content, and control over which advertisers could bid for their attention. For example, P1 began, “I wish [ads]in general communicated why they’re showing an ad to you” andalso described wanting “autonomy over whether or not I want to disclose a certain part of my identity on my own terms ... rather than just being tracked” (P1).P6 picked up this theme, describing unease with “the sense of being watched, being tracked,” and pointing out the particular pri-vacy needs of many LGBT people that are not publicly out: “If You're not out yet, [you might] be afraid that your mom’s going tobe looking over your shoulder [while you are] scrolling throughInstagram” (P6). Other participants also mentioned concerns about security and privacy online, including P14: “I think in the globalInternet age everyone is very, very concerned about privacy and security. I don’t know what to do about that—and this is again working with the assumption that I must live with [targeted] ads. I Would rather have companies ask me [instead of inferring] ... so I Can just decline” (P14).4.3.3 Queer people imagine the ability to opt out entirely. Partic-ipants’ desire for autonomy frequently stemmed from a wish to escape ad targeting systems altogether. One participant made clear their desire to avoid ad targeting specifically, despite being com-fortable and even interested in other types of ads: “Get rid of [it]... I feel like people around me don’t shop based on seeing what-ever is available in ads. [Instead they] buy things because they become popular, or [when] a curator”—a “real person, influencer or otherwise”—“promotes an item” (P10). When asked what she would change about ads if she could change anything, P11 also said, “I Would probably get rid of it. If you gave me a magic wand that can change anything about online advertising, I wouldn’t have online advertising” (P11).",1713-17,"for those holding multiple marginalized identities, including participants of color; trans, non-binary, and gender-nonconforming participants; those with disabilities; and fat participants.",
20,ConventionalFemininity,Causal_Theory,"We conducted 18 semi-structured interviews over Zoom lasting between 30 and 45 minutes, which were recorded for transcription and analysis. Participants received a written consent form before the interviews and were compensated with a $15 Amazon gift card distributed via email afterward. Participants in this paper are identified by unique anonymous identifiers (P1 - P18) to maintain their privacy. Our study was reviewed and approved by the StanfordUniversity Institutional Review Board.In the interviews, we asked about participants’ experiences with online advertising in three parts: first asking questions about their experiences overall with online ads, second asking them to reflect on ad targeting and its relationship to various aspects of their iden-tities, and third relating to their identity as an LGBTQ+ person. The Complete interview guide is listed in Appendix A. At the close of the interview, we asked participants open-ended demographic ques-tions, having them provide any or all of the following in their own words: age, gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity, and nationality.Part 1: Online advertising. We asked participants which platforms they were most active on, how frequently they encountered ads on those platforms, and what types of advertising they encountered.We also sought to understand how and why participants engaged with ads they considered compelling, asking participants to recall an ad they had recently interacted with and reflect on the charac-teristics, including aspects of the images or text, that drew their attention.Part 2: Ad targeting. Next, to understand participants’ beliefs about what inferences ad platforms may be making and how they believe such inferences are made, we asked them to reflect on the kinds of themes, people, and other imagery they usually see in their targeted ads, and speculate as to why they receive such content. Wealso explored the relationship of this content with multiple aspects of their identities, asking about feelings of mis/representation and whether or not they wanted these identity aspects to be represented and/or inferred by ad targeting systems.Part 3: Targeted ads and LGBTQ+ identity. In our final set of interview questions, we explored participants’ perceptions of pos-itive and negative impacts on LGBTQ+ people and communities.In relation to negative impacts, we asked further questions about participants' knowledge and use of strategies for avoiding ad tar-geting, as well as what they would like to see changed (including more realistic and more speculative ideas). Though extant theoretical frameworks shaped our inquiries in this work, our goal was to let the patterns of our data guide our anal-ysis, so we chose a reflexive approach [11]. Initially, one author conducted line-by-line open coding of all transcripts to develop a codebook of keywords and sub-keywords. Using this codebook,another author took a second pass, coding the transcripts a second time and updating, replacing, or adding additional keywords as needed. The first coding pass was conducted using NVivo qual-itative analysis software, while the second was conducted usingDelve for better collaboration. After collaborative discussions of the coded content, these two authors came to a consensus about the final set of codes and coded content. Examples of codes included: “binary gender norms”, “control/autonomy”, “lacking nuance”, and“feels creepy”.Themes were collaboratively synthesized based on the most prevalent codes, developed narratively, and divided into three major sets of insights pertaining to participants’ views on ad content, ad targeting as it currently exists, and ideals and alternatives they envisioned. We re-referenced the interview transcripts to refine and finalize themes, ensuring they emerged as directly as possible from our data. This study involves data collection with LGBTQ+ individuals, a group that has specific privacy and safety concerns. This is espe-cially true given the range of risks faced by some queer people due to their nationalities (homosexuality is still criminalized in some countries [57]), gender identities (transgender people, especially transfeminine people of color, face a disproportionate risk of vio-lence [22]), and other attributes. We, the research team, took care of our recruitment, data collection, and analysis to retain their con-fidentiality, including not requiring participants to provide their legal names, compensating them using gift cards not attached to their legal identities, and ensuring that only the research team had access to the transcripts and recordings. Additionally, we acknowl-edge the tensions and risks inherent to conducting research focused on marginalized communities and individuals [40]. Our resulting analysis is not only shaped by a theoretical grounding in queer and feminist theory, but each author’s individual experiences as a per-son marginalized along the axes of gender, race, sexuality, ethnicity,and other identities (with overlaps and privileges therein). We divide our findings regarding ad content into three main points:the overarching lack of representations of queerness, stereotypical-ity when such identities were seen in ads, and the particular lack of representation faced by those with multiple marginalized identities.4.1.1 Participants’ ads reflect heterosexual societal norms. Although participants did widely report receiving ads targeted to them that depicted queer people, across the board they reported that many or most of the ads they saw were instead reflective of dominant hetero-sexual societal norms. P5 summarized, “I think there is starting to become change, but I see a lot of ... stereotypically, traditionally beau-tiful [people in ads] who are tall, or thin, or white, or able-bodied,etc.” (P5). This was echoed by other participants; P16 described the people they saw as being “generally either thin white men or thin white women. Generally attractive people” (P16). Another, despite seeing some ads geared towards queer people, noted that “most of the ads I see I typically feature straight couples” (P2). This aligns with prior work about ads’ reflections of dominant culture [60].4.1.2 Representations of queerness perpetuate stereotypes. The overall lack of queer representation was exacerbated by the heavy pres-ence of stereotypes in targeted ads seemingly intended to interestqueer consumers. In line with Kates [36]’s assessment that advertis-ing as an activity reflects dominant discourses, P1 described feeling caricatured: “It’s like the stereotype of what a gay man is ... like super dramatized, a point where I’m like, I don’t know anybody who acts like that. [...] I don’t know who’s relating to that; it’s [how]straight people think gay people act” (P1).More specifically, participants mentioned seeing stereotypes relating queerness to promiscuity and substance use. P6 describe some of the ads they saw as “hypersexualized”: “The advertisements are all, like, nightclub lighting, like all of these hot 32-year-old with basically all their clothes off, dancing and making out with each other” (P6). They clarified, “I don’t think that’s bad, it looks like they’re having a great time, but it’s really weird. I’m not sure if I consider it offensive or not.” Another described the ads they saw representing queer people as “pertaining to drinking, like fo rbeers” (P15). Unfortunately, this is nothing new; as prior literature has recorded, and some of our older participants remembered, such stereotypes reflect historical patterns in advertising [60]. P13 (age41) noted, “It used to be [that] alcohol and cigarettes were the only companies [with] gay [representation in] ads, so that felt a little stigmatizing” (P13).Other participants also felt misrepresented by content that, de-spite featuring appropriate representations of queerness, did not align with their own personal queer identities. For instance, a high-femme lesbian participant pointed out that the queer-targeted ads she received made “incorrect assumptions” about her gender presentation: “While I am gay, that does not immediately imply that Iwant to dress androgynously” (P11).4.1.3 Lack of diversity especially impacts those with intersecting identities. The lack of diversity in ad content was especially notice-able for those holding multiple marginalized identities, including participants of color; trans, non-binary, and gender-nonconforming participants; those with disabilities; and fat participants. A majority of participants observed a lack of racial diversity in their targeted ads; both white and non-white participants had their targeted advertisements dominated by depictions of white people. P1, a gay Iraqi man, described his targeted ads as being centered on white Western lifestyles and perspectives, sharing,“Any identities outside of that are super hard to see, or they're super exaggerated” (P1). This was one of the most widely-reported themes; 14 out of 18 participants mentioned the overwhelming whiteness in their ads. Gender-nonconforming participants noted that even when systems accurately determined their gender identities, their targeted ads reflected heteropatriarchy assumptions about their experi-ences. P6, a non-binary lesbian, reflected on the inadequacy of the lesbian representation they saw in ads: “Where there’s a lesbian cou-ple, usually both women are white and very feminine [with] longhair—I don’t really think we’ll ever see that much butch [represen-tation] because of the way our culture constructs what a beautiful woman looks like” (P6). A non-binary participant reported, “I feel like [my ads] are targeted more towards trans men, or someonewho’s more masculine than I am” (P2). Participants also cited a lack of body diversity in the models they saw, in particular a lack of depictions of fatness and disability. Consistent with prior work [23], our participants considered this problematic: “I’m a fat person ... I’m part of a lot of groups for other fat people. I think a lot of ads show me weight loss [content]because they assume that ... I want to lose weight, so that’s one thing they get wrong” (P3). Another participant reported that their ads overlook “disability or chronic illness—I have some chronic illnesses and friends who do as well, and it can be hard to see ads that don’t represent your queer friend group” (P5). Aside from their concerns about ad content, all participants reflected some degree of awareness and discomfort with ad target-ing systems identifying them as queer, a type of inference they were easily able to identify: “[Unlike ads for straight people,] you can really tell the ad targeting is for queer people; [advertisers]make it so obvious” (P18). Their responses to these inference- and categorization-based systems’ treatment ranged from mild discom-fort to experiences of significant emotional harm.4.2.1 Ad targeting made participants feel unsettled and unsafe.While participants expressed frustration with targeted advertis-ing that missed the mark, they shared that that accurate targeting often felt “creepy” (P8), “disconcerting” (P13), and even “scary” (P3).Creepiness, in particular, was a recurring theme. P3 reported feeling torn between the desire for convenience and this creepiness: “I get kind of creeped out when [ad systems] seem like they know a lot of things about my life and my interests. [...] From convenience sake,I’ll be more likely to see things that I’d be interested in ... but then,on the other hand, I don’t like advertisements and how all these places are collecting personal data about me” (P3).Taking the same perspective from the opposite direction, P4described that misrepresentative content sometimes felt reassur-ing, in that the ad targeting system “doesn’t really know me” (P4).Feeling “seen” by targeted ad systems frequently felt as much like surveillance as inclusion. In the United Sates, where most majora's platforms are based, legal protection of queer identities is based on the right to privacy [30]; it is unsurprising, then, that queerpeople’s privacy concerns are highly specific, and connected to their larger concerns about their civil rights. P11, a lesbian transwoman who expressed a desire for ads more relevant to her transidentity, expressed simultaneous concern: “I just don’t love the idea that the internet sees me for me, because that’s kind of danger-ous sometimes. There are state legislatures and whole countries that have passed laws to try to make it difficult, if not straight-up impossible, for me to live” (P11).4.2.2 Participants made sense of ad targeting and its failures. Partic-ipants had many plausible hypotheses for the mechanisms behind their targeted ads, including their own behaviors (P18: “I like to do creative writing so I go to baby name websites to look for names for characters, and ... the ads might be thinking, oh this person is pregnant because they’re looking up baby names”), and advertisers lacking nuanced understandings of queerness (P1, a gay middle eastern man, described many of his ads as “completely alienating to other members of the community [besides white gay men]”).Another common explanation participants pointed to was the advertising industry itself. P14 described white-centric ad content as being reflective of “the nature of the advertising business”, as well as broader social norms: “A lot of the ads showcase white gay male models—cisgender, white models—which, I mean, that’s obviously problematic, but it’s also a reflection of kind of the hegemonic discourse that is almost always in queer spaces, right? Unless you’rein a particularly non-white space.” (P14)4.2.3 Corporate tokenization of queerness contributes to skepticism. I don’t want them to market toward me—like, I don't think that companies can have a genuine care about communities that I’m part of, so I’d rather they [not] before and try to just get my money. (P4)Many participants were attuned to the financial incentives for brands targeting queer customers. They found this motive oppor-tunistic and profit-seeking, describing it as undermining the value of representation: “They’re all trying to get me to buy things, that’swhat their end goal is, because capitalism. So I feel like that’s a root of problematic advertising, is that they don’t really care about the impact, they just want you to buy” (P3). In the context of trans-gender representation, P18 expressed that increased inclusion feltshallow and performative: “[Many organizations are] jumping on the bandwagon, and when it actually comes down to support trans rights, they’re not there” (P18). Several participants reported that this kind of opportunistic rep-resentation, which they described as tokenizing, insincere, or pink-washing, was especially common during Pride Month, even from brands and organizations that otherwise did not otherwise make an effort to include queer customers among their customer base: “During Pride Month in New York, where there were a lot of ads Ifelt didn’t really target me correctly—they were just like, here’s the corporation, we put a rainbow logo on it” (P5).4.2.4 Queer people suffer emotional harms due to ad targeting.I think it’s the ads that are creating unrealistic image of our community and of ourselves.

Initially, one author conducted line-by-line open coding of all transcripts to develop a codebook of keywords and sub-keywords. Using this codebook,another author took a second pass, coding the transcripts a second time and updating, replacing, or adding additional keywords as needed. The first coding pass was conducted using NVivo qual-itative analysis software, while the second was conducted usingDelve for better collaboration. After collaborative discussions of the coded content, these two authors came to a consensus about the final set of codes and coded content. Examples of codes included: “binary gender norms”, “control/autonomy”, “lacking nuance”, and“feels creepy”.Themes were collaboratively synthesized based on the most prevalent codes, developed narratively, and divided into three major sets of insights pertaining to participants’ views on ad content, ad targeting as it currently exists, and ideals and alternatives they envisioned. We re-referenced the interview transcripts to refine and finalize themes, ensuring they emerged as directly as possible from our data. This study involves data collection with LGBTQ+ individuals, a group that has specific privacy and safety concerns. This is espe-cially true given the range of risks faced by some queer people due to their nationalities (homosexuality is still criminalized in some countries [57]), gender identities (transgender people, especially transfeminine people of color, face a disproportionate risk of vio-lence [22]), and other attributes. We, the research team, took care of our recruitment, data collection, and analysis to retain their con-fidentiality, including not requiring participants to provide their legal names, compensating them using gift cards not attached to their legal identities, and ensuring that only the research team had access to the transcripts and recordings. Additionally, we acknowl-edge the tensions and risks inherent to conducting research focused on marginalized communities and individuals [40]. Our resulting analysis is not only shaped by a theoretical grounding in queer and feminist theory, but each author’s individual experiences as a per-son marginalized along the axes of gender, race, sexuality, ethnicity,and other identities (with overlaps and privileges therein). We divide our findings regarding ad content into three main points:the overarching lack of representations of queerness, stereotypical-ity when such identities were seen in ads, and the particular lack of representation faced by those with multiple marginalized identities.4.1.1 Participants’ ads reflect heterosexual societal norms. Although participants did widely report receiving ads targeted to them that depicted queer people, across the board they reported that many or most of the ads they saw were instead reflective of dominant hetero-sexual societal norms. P5 summarized, “I think there is starting to become change, but I see a lot of ... stereotypically, traditionally beau-tiful [people in ads] who are tall, or thin, or white, or able-bodied,etc.” (P5). This was echoed by other participants; P16 described the people they saw as being “generally either thin white men or thin white women. Generally attractive people” (P16). Another, despite seeing some ads geared towards queer people, noted that “most of the ads I see I typically feature straight couples” (P2). This aligns with prior work about ads’ reflections of dominant culture [60].4.1.2 Representations of queerness perpetuate stereotypes. The overall lack of queer representation was exacerbated by the heavy pres-ence of stereotypes in targeted ads seemingly intended to interestqueer consumers. In line with Kates [36]’s assessment that advertis-ing as an activity reflects dominant discourses, P1 described feeling caricatured: “It’s like the stereotype of what a gay man is ... like super dramatized, a point where I’m like, I don’t know anybody who acts like that. [...] I don’t know who’s relating to that; it’s [how]straight people think gay people act” (P1).More specifically, participants mentioned seeing stereotypes relating queerness to promiscuity and substance use. P6 describe some of the ads they saw as “hypersexualized”: “The advertisements are all, like, nightclub lighting, like all of these hot 32-year-old with basically all their clothes off, dancing and making out with each other” (P6). They clarified, “I don’t think that’s bad, it looks like they’re having a great time, but it’s really weird. I’m not sure if I consider it offensive or not.” Another described the ads they saw representing queer people as “pertaining to drinking, like fo rbeers” (P15). Unfortunately, this is nothing new; as prior literature has recorded, and some of our older participants remembered, such stereotypes reflect historical patterns in advertising [60]. P13 (age41) noted, “It used to be [that] alcohol and cigarettes were the only companies [with] gay [representation in] ads, so that felt a little stigmatizing” (P13).Other participants also felt misrepresented by content that, de-spite featuring appropriate representations of queerness, did not align with their own personal queer identities. For instance, a high-femme lesbian participant pointed out that the queer-targeted ads she received made “incorrect assumptions” about her gender presentation: “While I am gay, that does not immediately imply that Iwant to dress androgynously” (P11).4.1.3 Lack of diversity especially impacts those with intersecting identities. The lack of diversity in ad content was especially notice-able for those holding multiple marginalized identities, including participants of color; trans, non-binary, and gender-nonconforming participants; those with disabilities; and fat participants. A majority of participants observed a lack of racial diversity in their targeted ads; both white and non-white participants had their targeted advertisements dominated by depictions of white people. P1, a gay Iraqi man, described his targeted ads as being centered on white Western lifestyles and perspectives, sharing,“Any identities outside of that are super hard to see, or they're super exaggerated” (P1). This was one of the most widely-reported themes; 14 out of 18 participants mentioned the overwhelming whiteness in their ads. Gender-nonconforming participants noted that even when systems accurately determined their gender identities, their targeted ads reflected heteropatriarchy assumptions about their experi-ences. P6, a non-binary lesbian, reflected on the inadequacy of the lesbian representation they saw in ads: “Where there’s a lesbian cou-ple, usually both women are white and very feminine [with] longhair—I don’t really think we’ll ever see that much butch [represen-tation] because of the way our culture constructs what a beautiful woman looks like” (P6). A non-binary participant reported, “I feel like [my ads] are targeted more towards trans men, or someonewho’s more masculine than I am” (P2). Participants also cited a lack of body diversity in the models they saw, in particular a lack of depictions of fatness and disability. Consistent with prior work [23], our participants considered this problematic: “I’m a fat person ... I’m part of a lot of groups for other fat people. I think a lot of ads show me weight loss [content]because they assume that ... I want to lose weight, so that’s one thing they get wrong” (P3). Another participant reported that their ads overlook “disability or chronic illness—I have some chronic illnesses and friends who do as well, and it can be hard to see ads that don’t represent your queer friend group” (P5). Aside from their concerns about ad content, all participants reflected some degree of awareness and discomfort with ad target-ing systems identifying them as queer, a type of inference they were easily able to identify: “[Unlike ads for straight people,] you can really tell the ad targeting is for queer people; [advertisers]make it so obvious” (P18). Their responses to these inference- and categorization-based systems’ treatment ranged from mild discom-fort to experiences of significant emotional harm.4.2.1 Ad targeting made participants feel unsettled and unsafe.While participants expressed frustration with targeted advertis-ing that missed the mark, they shared that that accurate targeting often felt “creepy” (P8), “disconcerting” (P13), and even “scary” (P3).Creepiness, in particular, was a recurring theme. P3 reported feeling torn between the desire for convenience and this creepiness: “I get kind of creeped out when [ad systems] seem like they know a lot of things about my life and my interests. [...] From convenience sake,I’ll be more likely to see things that I’d be interested in ... but then,on the other hand, I don’t like advertisements and how all these places are collecting personal data about me” (P3).Taking the same perspective from the opposite direction, P4described that misrepresentative content sometimes felt reassur-ing, in that the ad targeting system “doesn’t really know me” (P4).Feeling “seen” by targeted ad systems frequently felt as much like surveillance as inclusion. In the United Sates, where most majora's platforms are based, legal protection of queer identities is based on the right to privacy [30]; it is unsurprising, then, that queerpeople’s privacy concerns are highly specific, and connected to their larger concerns about their civil rights. P11, a lesbian transwoman who expressed a desire for ads more relevant to her transidentity, expressed simultaneous concern: “I just don’t love the idea that the internet sees me for me, because that’s kind of danger-ous sometimes. There are state legislatures and whole countries that have passed laws to try to make it difficult, if not straight-up impossible, for me to live” (P11).4.2.2 Participants made sense of ad targeting and its failures. Partic-ipants had many plausible hypotheses for the mechanisms behind their targeted ads, including their own behaviors (P18: “I like to do creative writing so I go to baby name websites to look for names for characters, and ... the ads might be thinking, oh this person is pregnant because they’re looking up baby names”), and advertisers lacking nuanced understandings of queerness (P1, a gay middle eastern man, described many of his ads as “completely alienating to other members of the community [besides white gay men]”).Another common explanation participants pointed to was the advertising industry itself. P14 described white-centric ad content as being reflective of “the nature of the advertising business”, as well as broader social norms: “A lot of the ads showcase white gay male models—cisgender, white models—which, I mean, that’s obviously problematic, but it’s also a reflection of kind of the hegemonic discourse that is almost always in queer spaces, right? Unless you’rein a particularly non-white space.” (P14)4.2.3 Corporate tokenization of queerness contributes to skepticism. I don’t want them to market toward me—like, I don't think that companies can have a genuine care about communities that I’m part of, so I’d rather they [not] before and try to just get my money. (P4)Many participants were attuned to the financial incentives for brands targeting queer customers. They found this motive oppor-tunistic and profit-seeking, describing it as undermining the value of representation: “They’re all trying to get me to buy things, that’swhat their end goal is, because capitalism. So I feel like that’s a root of problematic advertising, is that they don’t really care about the impact, they just want you to buy” (P3). In the context of trans-gender representation, P18 expressed that increased inclusion feltshallow and performative: “[Many organizations are] jumping on the bandwagon, and when it actually comes down to support trans rights, they’re not there” (P18). Several participants reported that this kind of opportunistic rep-resentation, which they described as tokenizing, insincere, or pink-washing, was especially common during Pride Month, even from brands and organizations that otherwise did not otherwise make an effort to include queer customers among their customer base: “During Pride Month in New York, where there were a lot of ads Ifelt didn’t really target me correctly—they were just like, here’s the corporation, we put a rainbow logo on it” (P5).4.2.4 Queer people suffer emotional harms due to ad targeting.I think it’s the ads that are creating unrealistic image of our community and of ourselves. (P8)As described in 4.1, participants found themselves targeted with some content that was obviously damaging, including ads for al-cohol (given that members of the LGBTQ+ community are dispro-portionately likely to suffer from substance abuse issues [50]), and those for weight loss (P3: “I would say, yeah, probably more so when I was younger than now, but still I would say [weight loss ads] probably do impact my body image issues”).Participants, especially (but not exclusively) those identifying as trans and non-binary, frequently reported feeling misgendered by their targeted ads. Misgendering—when the gendered elements of language used or the underlying inferences made about someone are incongruent with an individual’s gender identity—is a form of harm commonly experienced by transgender people, though it can occur to others as well [42]. One non-binary participant (who doesn't identify as a woman) described feeling misgendered by their ads:“I feel the misrepresentation the most when it has to do with babies,and I feel like those ads are always very gendered, very targeted towards women and society’s idea of [what] a mother or a womanist. [Those] ads make me feel very weird” (P2). Explaining the impact this has on their self-image, they said, “When I see ads, especially marriage- and pregnancy-related ads that are targeted towards women, it does make [me] feel like, oh no, is this how people[in real life] see me, if this is what my browsing data indicates?”(P2). A cisgender gay male participant also reported receiving ads targeted to women, and that this made him question his identity for a time: “I did struggle a lot with my gender identity for a while because when you’re constantly getting ... ads targeted for a female,I was like, how do I identify? [...] I think it does create a lot of confusion” (P1). This feeling of confusion was also echoed by anon-binary participant who reported that the oscillating gender essentialist extremes in their ads led them to conclude that these systems found their identity “confusing.” They explained, “For some reason I get a lot of ads related to pregnancy or having children.On the other end of the spectrum, I get a lot of ads for jocks straps,which I don’t really understand. But I think [the system is] very confused about what my gender is” (P18).In addition to these direct harms, participants also expressed experiencing more nebulous harm caused by ads acting as a reminder of power and privilege in society at large. As P12 thoughtfully put it, “If [ad targeting] took into account [queer] identities, I would feel like at least I’m recognized in society. But if they do not ... I[am reminded that] I’m left out, that many people do not accept me as who I am” (P12). In addition to understanding participants’ criticisms of ad targeting content and systems, we were interested in hearing their generative perspectives—changes they felt could improve their experiences with targeted ads. Proposed shifts included more diverse ad content,more transparency about the ad targeting process, more autonomy in the use and collection of people’s personal data, and the ability to forgo targeted advertising in its current form entirely.4.3.1 Queer people want more diversity in ad content.It has to be actually really nuanced and critical, it can't just be representation for the sake of making [brands]look better on the surface. (P4)We previously discussed participants’ frustration with the preva-lence of stereotypes in the content that they encountered. A solution many identified was to increase diverse representation in ad con-tent. Participants highlighted the need for more racially diverse depictions of queer people, and for more body diversity in general. P16 voiced a desire to see more “people of all different appearances and sizes and races and presentations. A lot of times people like myself—thin, white, [female-assigned] people ... are the kind of[non-binary] people getting attention in the media.”Even the participants most skeptical of targeted advertising impact on queer communities acknowledged the value that rep-resentation holds for queer people, especially for its role in the identity formation of queer youth:If there were to be more [queer] representation, I also think having [it normalize] our identities—how we look and how we identify, or who we are—having that normalized [for] someone who’s young, maybe younger than 12, [to] see this representation and feel some kind of connection to it. [...] That is monumental,and something I would advocate more for. (P15)Participants did, however, understand visibility as a double-edged sword, with the potential to impact public perceptions ofLGBTQ+ people and communities both positively and negatively—something supported by prior research in television and print ad-vertising [7, 64]. As P16 put it: “You have to watch what’s going on out there, because for some people that aren’t in the LGBT commu-nity their only exposure to queer people might be through these ads, and they might be basing their views off those ads”.Many participants noted that improved diversity should not bedone solely to improve a brand’s rapport with queer consumers.Instead, they expressed a desire for advertisers to include nuancedqueer representation in content with broad reach. To quote P2, “[Iwant] more queer people and queer relationship representation,just in mainstream ads—I feel like a lot of the queer ads I see are just for queer-specific things”. Moreover, they wanted advertisers to back up visual cues with action and not, in the words of P4, “before and try to just get my money.” P16 echoed the same sentiment,drawing on the idea of “rainbow capitalism” [13]: “I think if I go to the website and they were just using [queer imagery] to attract people and not following through—you know, rainbow capitalism—that would further turn me off from the product. But if they had marketing I felt represented in and also supported causes I believed in, I would be more likely to support them, for sure” (P16).4.3.2 Queer people want more transparency and autonomy.[It’s scary] how much we’re already monitored, and how much [ad systems] already know about me. [...] [I Would prefer] increasing the amount of diversity within advertisements, without necessarily needing to know for sure if somebody identifies a certain way. (P15)The current user experience of ad platforms leaves little room for direct user input, a power differential noted by our participants.They were highly critical of the inference and categorization done by these systems and the lack of room for self-determination. They Suggested alternatives, including greater transparency about how they were being targeted, the ability to express boundaries or dis-content with certain ad content, and control over which advertisers could bid for their attention. For example, P1 began, “I wish [ads]in general communicated why they’re showing an ad to you” andalso described wanting “autonomy over whether or not I want to disclose a certain part of my identity on my own terms ... rather than just being tracked” (P1).P6 picked up this theme, describing unease with “the sense of being watched, being tracked,” and pointing out the particular pri-vacy needs of many LGBT people that are not publicly out: “If You're not out yet, [you might] be afraid that your mom’s going tobe looking over your shoulder [while you are] scrolling throughInstagram” (P6). Other participants also mentioned concerns about security and privacy online, including P14: “I think in the globalInternet age everyone is very, very concerned about privacy and security. I don’t know what to do about that—and this is again working with the assumption that I must live with [targeted] ads. I Would rather have companies ask me [instead of inferring] ... so I Can just decline” (P14).4.3.3 Queer people imagine the ability to opt out entirely. Partic-ipants’ desire for autonomy frequently stemmed from a wish to escape ad targeting systems altogether. One participant made clear their desire to avoid ad targeting specifically, despite being com-fortable and even interested in other types of ads: “Get rid of [it]... I feel like people around me don’t shop based on seeing what-ever is available in ads. [Instead they] buy things because they become popular, or [when] a curator”—a “real person, influencer or otherwise”—“promotes an item” (P10). When asked what she would change about ads if she could change anything, P11 also said, “I Would probably get rid of it. If you gave me a magic wand that can change anything about online advertising, I wouldn’t have online advertising” (P11).",1713-17,a lack of depictions of fatness,
22,LackOfDisabledRepresentation,Perceived_Problem,"We conducted 18 semi-structured interviews over Zoom lasting between 30 and 45 minutes, which were recorded for transcription and analysis. Participants received a written consent form before the interviews and were compensated with a $15 Amazon gift card distributed via email afterward. Participants in this paper are identified by unique anonymous identifiers (P1 - P18) to maintain their privacy. Our study was reviewed and approved by the StanfordUniversity Institutional Review Board.In the interviews, we asked about participants’ experiences with online advertising in three parts: first asking questions about their experiences overall with online ads, second asking them to reflect on ad targeting and its relationship to various aspects of their iden-tities, and third relating to their identity as an LGBTQ+ person. The Complete interview guide is listed in Appendix A. At the close of the interview, we asked participants open-ended demographic ques-tions, having them provide any or all of the following in their own words: age, gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity, and nationality.Part 1: Online advertising. We asked participants which platforms they were most active on, how frequently they encountered ads on those platforms, and what types of advertising they encountered.We also sought to understand how and why participants engaged with ads they considered compelling, asking participants to recall an ad they had recently interacted with and reflect on the charac-teristics, including aspects of the images or text, that drew their attention.Part 2: Ad targeting. Next, to understand participants’ beliefs about what inferences ad platforms may be making and how they believe such inferences are made, we asked them to reflect on the kinds of themes, people, and other imagery they usually see in their targeted ads, and speculate as to why they receive such content. Wealso explored the relationship of this content with multiple aspects of their identities, asking about feelings of mis/representation and whether or not they wanted these identity aspects to be represented and/or inferred by ad targeting systems.Part 3: Targeted ads and LGBTQ+ identity. In our final set of interview questions, we explored participants’ perceptions of pos-itive and negative impacts on LGBTQ+ people and communities.In relation to negative impacts, we asked further questions about participants' knowledge and use of strategies for avoiding ad tar-geting, as well as what they would like to see changed (including more realistic and more speculative ideas).

(P8)As described in 4.1, participants found themselves targeted with some content that was obviously damaging, including ads for al-cohol (given that members of the LGBTQ+ community are dispro-portionately likely to suffer from substance abuse issues [50]), and those for weight loss (P3: “I would say, yeah, probably more so when I was younger than now, but still I would say [weight loss ads] probably do impact my body image issues”).Participants, especially (but not exclusively) those identifying as trans and non-binary, frequently reported feeling misgendered by their targeted ads. Misgendering—when the gendered elements of language used or the underlying inferences made about someone are incongruent with an individual’s gender identity—is a form of harm commonly experienced by transgender people, though it can occur to others as well [42]. One non-binary participant (who doesn't identify as a woman) described feeling misgendered by their ads:“I feel the misrepresentation the most when it has to do with babies,and I feel like those ads are always very gendered, very targeted towards women and society’s idea of [what] a mother or a womanist. [Those] ads make me feel very weird” (P2). Explaining the impact this has on their self-image, they said, “When I see ads, especially marriage- and pregnancy-related ads that are targeted towards women, it does make [me] feel like, oh no, is this how people[in real life] see me, if this is what my browsing data indicates?”(P2). A cisgender gay male participant also reported receiving ads targeted to women, and that this made him question his identity for a time: “I did struggle a lot with my gender identity for a while because when you’re constantly getting ... ads targeted for a female,I was like, how do I identify? [...] I think it does create a lot of confusion” (P1). This feeling of confusion was also echoed by anon-binary participant who reported that the oscillating gender essentialist extremes in their ads led them to conclude that these systems found their identity “confusing.” They explained, “For some reason I get a lot of ads related to pregnancy or having children.On the other end of the spectrum, I get a lot of ads for jocks straps,which I don’t really understand. But I think [the system is] very confused about what my gender is” (P18).In addition to these direct harms, participants also expressed experiencing more nebulous harm caused by ads acting as a reminder of power and privilege in society at large. As P12 thoughtfully put it, “If [ad targeting] took into account [queer] identities, I would feel like at least I’m recognized in society. But if they do not ... I[am reminded that] I’m left out, that many people do not accept me as who I am” (P12). In addition to understanding participants’ criticisms of ad targeting content and systems, we were interested in hearing their generative perspectives—changes they felt could improve their experiences with targeted ads. Proposed shifts included more diverse ad content,more transparency about the ad targeting process, more autonomy in the use and collection of people’s personal data, and the ability to forgo targeted advertising in its current form entirely.4.3.1 Queer people want more diversity in ad content.It has to be actually really nuanced and critical, it can't just be representation for the sake of making [brands]look better on the surface. (P4)We previously discussed participants’ frustration with the preva-lence of stereotypes in the content that they encountered. A solution many identified was to increase diverse representation in ad con-tent. Participants highlighted the need for more racially diverse depictions of queer people, and for more body diversity in general. P16 voiced a desire to see more “people of all different appearances and sizes and races and presentations. A lot of times people like myself—thin, white, [female-assigned] people ... are the kind of[non-binary] people getting attention in the media.”Even the participants most skeptical of targeted advertising impact on queer communities acknowledged the value that rep-resentation holds for queer people, especially for its role in the identity formation of queer youth:If there were to be more [queer] representation, I also think having [it normalize] our identities—how we look and how we identify, or who we are—having that normalized [for] someone who’s young, maybe younger than 12, [to] see this representation and feel some kind of connection to it. [...] That is monumental,and something I would advocate more for. (P15)Participants did, however, understand visibility as a double-edged sword, with the potential to impact public perceptions ofLGBTQ+ people and communities both positively and negatively—something supported by prior research in television and print ad-vertising [7, 64]. As P16 put it: “You have to watch what’s going on out there, because for some people that aren’t in the LGBT commu-nity their only exposure to queer people might be through these ads, and they might be basing their views off those ads”.Many participants noted that improved diversity should not bedone solely to improve a brand’s rapport with queer consumers.Instead, they expressed a desire for advertisers to include nuancedqueer representation in content with broad reach. To quote P2, “[Iwant] more queer people and queer relationship representation,just in mainstream ads—I feel like a lot of the queer ads I see are just for queer-specific things”. Moreover, they wanted advertisers to back up visual cues with action and not, in the words of P4, “before and try to just get my money.” P16 echoed the same sentiment,drawing on the idea of “rainbow capitalism” [13]: “I think if I go to the website and they were just using [queer imagery] to attract people and not following through—you know, rainbow capitalism—that would further turn me off from the product. But if they had marketing I felt represented in and also supported causes I believed in, I would be more likely to support them, for sure” (P16).4.3.2 Queer people want more transparency and autonomy.[It’s scary] how much we’re already monitored, and how much [ad systems] already know about me. [...] [I Would prefer] increasing the amount of diversity within advertisements, without necessarily needing to know for sure if somebody identifies a certain way. (P15)The current user experience of ad platforms leaves little room for direct user input, a power differential noted by our participants.They were highly critical of the inference and categorization done by these systems and the lack of room for self-determination. They Suggested alternatives, including greater transparency about how they were being targeted, the ability to express boundaries or dis-content with certain ad content, and control over which advertisers could bid for their attention. For example, P1 began, “I wish [ads]in general communicated why they’re showing an ad to you” andalso described wanting “autonomy over whether or not I want to disclose a certain part of my identity on my own terms ... rather than just being tracked” (P1).P6 picked up this theme, describing unease with “the sense of being watched, being tracked,” and pointing out the particular pri-vacy needs of many LGBT people that are not publicly out: “If You're not out yet, [you might] be afraid that your mom’s going tobe looking over your shoulder [while you are] scrolling throughInstagram” (P6). Other participants also mentioned concerns about security and privacy online, including P14: “I think in the globalInternet age everyone is very, very concerned about privacy and security. I don’t know what to do about that—and this is again working with the assumption that I must live with [targeted] ads. I Would rather have companies ask me [instead of inferring] ... so I Can just decline” (P14).4.3.3 Queer people imagine the ability to opt out entirely. Partic-ipants’ desire for autonomy frequently stemmed from a wish to escape ad targeting systems altogether. One participant made clear their desire to avoid ad targeting specifically, despite being com-fortable and even interested in other types of ads: “Get rid of [it]... I feel like people around me don’t shop based on seeing what-ever is available in ads. [Instead they] buy things because they become popular, or [when] a curator”—a “real person, influencer or otherwise”—“promotes an item” (P10). When asked what she would change about ads if she could change anything, P11 also said, “I Would probably get rid of it. If you gave me a magic wand that can change anything about online advertising, I wouldn’t have online advertising” (P11).",1713-17,a lack of depictions of  [...] disability,
23,Brands,Agent,"We conducted 18 semi-structured interviews over Zoom lasting between 30 and 45 minutes, which were recorded for transcription and analysis. Participants received a written consent form before the interviews and were compensated with a $15 Amazon gift card distributed via email afterward. Participants in this paper are identified by unique anonymous identifiers (P1 - P18) to maintain their privacy. Our study was reviewed and approved by the StanfordUniversity Institutional Review Board.In the interviews, we asked about participants’ experiences with online advertising in three parts: first asking questions about their experiences overall with online ads, second asking them to reflect on ad targeting and its relationship to various aspects of their iden-tities, and third relating to their identity as an LGBTQ+ person. The Complete interview guide is listed in Appendix A. At the close of the interview, we asked participants open-ended demographic ques-tions, having them provide any or all of the following in their own words: age, gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity, and nationality.Part 1: Online advertising. We asked participants which platforms they were most active on, how frequently they encountered ads on those platforms, and what types of advertising they encountered.We also sought to understand how and why participants engaged with ads they considered compelling, asking participants to recall an ad they had recently interacted with and reflect on the charac-teristics, including aspects of the images or text, that drew their attention.Part 2: Ad targeting. Next, to understand participants’ beliefs about what inferences ad platforms may be making and how they believe such inferences are made, we asked them to reflect on the kinds of themes, people, and other imagery they usually see in their targeted ads, and speculate as to why they receive such content. Wealso explored the relationship of this content with multiple aspects of their identities, asking about feelings of mis/representation and whether or not they wanted these identity aspects to be represented and/or inferred by ad targeting systems.Part 3: Targeted ads and LGBTQ+ identity. In our final set of interview questions, we explored participants’ perceptions of pos-itive and negative impacts on LGBTQ+ people and communities.In relation to negative impacts, we asked further questions about participants' knowledge and use of strategies for avoiding ad tar-geting, as well as what they would like to see changed (including more realistic and more speculative ideas). Though extant theoretical frameworks shaped our inquiries in this work, our goal was to let the patterns of our data guide our anal-ysis, so we chose a reflexive approach [11]. Initially, one author conducted line-by-line open coding of all transcripts to develop a codebook of keywords and sub-keywords. Using this codebook,another author took a second pass, coding the transcripts a second time and updating, replacing, or adding additional keywords as needed. The first coding pass was conducted using NVivo qual-itative analysis software, while the second was conducted usingDelve for better collaboration. After collaborative discussions of the coded content, these two authors came to a consensus about the final set of codes and coded content. Examples of codes included: “binary gender norms”, “control/autonomy”, “lacking nuance”, and“feels creepy”.Themes were collaboratively synthesized based on the most prevalent codes, developed narratively, and divided into three major sets of insights pertaining to participants’ views on ad content, ad targeting as it currently exists, and ideals and alternatives they envisioned. We re-referenced the interview transcripts to refine and finalize themes, ensuring they emerged as directly as possible from our data. This study involves data collection with LGBTQ+ individuals, a group that has specific privacy and safety concerns. This is espe-cially true given the range of risks faced by some queer people due to their nationalities (homosexuality is still criminalized in some countries [57]), gender identities (transgender people, especially transfeminine people of color, face a disproportionate risk of vio-lence [22]), and other attributes. We, the research team, took care of our recruitment, data collection, and analysis to retain their con-fidentiality, including not requiring participants to provide their legal names, compensating them using gift cards not attached to their legal identities, and ensuring that only the research team had access to the transcripts and recordings. Additionally, we acknowl-edge the tensions and risks inherent to conducting research focused on marginalized communities and individuals [40]. Our resulting analysis is not only shaped by a theoretical grounding in queer and feminist theory, but each author’s individual experiences as a per-son marginalized along the axes of gender, race, sexuality, ethnicity,and other identities (with overlaps and privileges therein). We divide our findings regarding ad content into three main points:the overarching lack of representations of queerness, stereotypical-ity when such identities were seen in ads, and the particular lack of representation faced by those with multiple marginalized identities.4.1.1 Participants’ ads reflect heterosexual societal norms. Although participants did widely report receiving ads targeted to them that depicted queer people, across the board they reported that many or most of the ads they saw were instead reflective of dominant hetero-sexual societal norms. P5 summarized, “I think there is starting to become change, but I see a lot of ... stereotypically, traditionally beau-tiful [people in ads] who are tall, or thin, or white, or able-bodied,etc.” (P5). This was echoed by other participants; P16 described the people they saw as being “generally either thin white men or thin white women. Generally attractive people” (P16). Another, despite seeing some ads geared towards queer people, noted that “most of the ads I see I typically feature straight couples” (P2). This aligns with prior work about ads’ reflections of dominant culture [60].4.1.2 Representations of queerness perpetuate stereotypes. The overall lack of queer representation was exacerbated by the heavy pres-ence of stereotypes in targeted ads seemingly intended to interestqueer consumers. In line with Kates [36]’s assessment that advertis-ing as an activity reflects dominant discourses, P1 described feeling caricatured: “It’s like the stereotype of what a gay man is ... like super dramatized, a point where I’m like, I don’t know anybody who acts like that. [...] I don’t know who’s relating to that; it’s [how]straight people think gay people act” (P1).More specifically, participants mentioned seeing stereotypes relating queerness to promiscuity and substance use. P6 describe some of the ads they saw as “hypersexualized”: “The advertisements are all, like, nightclub lighting, like all of these hot 32-year-old with basically all their clothes off, dancing and making out with each other” (P6). They clarified, “I don’t think that’s bad, it looks like they’re having a great time, but it’s really weird. I’m not sure if I consider it offensive or not.” Another described the ads they saw representing queer people as “pertaining to drinking, like fo rbeers” (P15). Unfortunately, this is nothing new; as prior literature has recorded, and some of our older participants remembered, such stereotypes reflect historical patterns in advertising [60]. P13 (age41) noted, “It used to be [that] alcohol and cigarettes were the only companies [with] gay [representation in] ads, so that felt a little stigmatizing” (P13).Other participants also felt misrepresented by content that, de-spite featuring appropriate representations of queerness, did not align with their own personal queer identities. For instance, a high-femme lesbian participant pointed out that the queer-targeted ads she received made “incorrect assumptions” about her gender presentation: “While I am gay, that does not immediately imply that Iwant to dress androgynously” (P11).4.1.3 Lack of diversity especially impacts those with intersecting identities. The lack of diversity in ad content was especially notice-able for those holding multiple marginalized identities, including participants of color; trans, non-binary, and gender-nonconforming participants; those with disabilities; and fat participants. A majority of participants observed a lack of racial diversity in their targeted ads; both white and non-white participants had their targeted advertisements dominated by depictions of white people. P1, a gay Iraqi man, described his targeted ads as being centered on white Western lifestyles and perspectives, sharing,“Any identities outside of that are super hard to see, or they're super exaggerated” (P1). This was one of the most widely-reported themes; 14 out of 18 participants mentioned the overwhelming whiteness in their ads. Gender-nonconforming participants noted that even when systems accurately determined their gender identities, their targeted ads reflected heteropatriarchy assumptions about their experi-ences. P6, a non-binary lesbian, reflected on the inadequacy of the lesbian representation they saw in ads: “Where there’s a lesbian cou-ple, usually both women are white and very feminine [with] longhair—I don’t really think we’ll ever see that much butch [represen-tation] because of the way our culture constructs what a beautiful woman looks like” (P6). A non-binary participant reported, “I feel like [my ads] are targeted more towards trans men, or someonewho’s more masculine than I am” (P2). Participants also cited a lack of body diversity in the models they saw, in particular a lack of depictions of fatness and disability. Consistent with prior work [23], our participants considered this problematic: “I’m a fat person ... I’m part of a lot of groups for other fat people. I think a lot of ads show me weight loss [content]because they assume that ... I want to lose weight, so that’s one thing they get wrong” (P3). Another participant reported that their ads overlook “disability or chronic illness—I have some chronic illnesses and friends who do as well, and it can be hard to see ads that don’t represent your queer friend group” (P5). Aside from their concerns about ad content, all participants reflected some degree of awareness and discomfort with ad target-ing systems identifying them as queer, a type of inference they were easily able to identify: “[Unlike ads for straight people,] you can really tell the ad targeting is for queer people; [advertisers]make it so obvious” (P18). Their responses to these inference- and categorization-based systems’ treatment ranged from mild discom-fort to experiences of significant emotional harm.4.2.1 Ad targeting made participants feel unsettled and unsafe.While participants expressed frustration with targeted advertis-ing that missed the mark, they shared that that accurate targeting often felt “creepy” (P8), “disconcerting” (P13), and even “scary” (P3).Creepiness, in particular, was a recurring theme. P3 reported feeling torn between the desire for convenience and this creepiness: “I get kind of creeped out when [ad systems] seem like they know a lot of things about my life and my interests. [...] From convenience sake,I’ll be more likely to see things that I’d be interested in ... but then,on the other hand, I don’t like advertisements and how all these places are collecting personal data about me” (P3).Taking the same perspective from the opposite direction, P4described that misrepresentative content sometimes felt reassur-ing, in that the ad targeting system “doesn’t really know me” (P4).Feeling “seen” by targeted ad systems frequently felt as much like surveillance as inclusion. In the United Sates, where most majora's platforms are based, legal protection of queer identities is based on the right to privacy [30]; it is unsurprising, then, that queerpeople’s privacy concerns are highly specific, and connected to their larger concerns about their civil rights. P11, a lesbian transwoman who expressed a desire for ads more relevant to her transidentity, expressed simultaneous concern: “I just don’t love the idea that the internet sees me for me, because that’s kind of danger-ous sometimes. There are state legislatures and whole countries that have passed laws to try to make it difficult, if not straight-up impossible, for me to live” (P11).4.2.2 Participants made sense of ad targeting and its failures. Partic-ipants had many plausible hypotheses for the mechanisms behind their targeted ads, including their own behaviors (P18: “I like to do creative writing so I go to baby name websites to look for names for characters, and ... the ads might be thinking, oh this person is pregnant because they’re looking up baby names”), and advertisers lacking nuanced understandings of queerness (P1, a gay middle eastern man, described many of his ads as “completely alienating to other members of the community [besides white gay men]”).Another common explanation participants pointed to was the advertising industry itself. P14 described white-centric ad content as being reflective of “the nature of the advertising business”, as well as broader social norms: “A lot of the ads showcase white gay male models—cisgender, white models—which, I mean, that’s obviously problematic, but it’s also a reflection of kind of the hegemonic discourse that is almost always in queer spaces, right? Unless you’rein a particularly non-white space.” (P14)4.2.3 Corporate tokenization of queerness contributes to skepticism. I don’t want them to market toward me—like, I don't think that companies can have a genuine care about communities that I’m part of, so I’d rather they [not] before and try to just get my money. (P4)Many participants were attuned to the financial incentives for brands targeting queer customers. They found this motive oppor-tunistic and profit-seeking, describing it as undermining the value of representation: “They’re all trying to get me to buy things, that’swhat their end goal is, because capitalism. So I feel like that’s a root of problematic advertising, is that they don’t really care about the impact, they just want you to buy” (P3). In the context of trans-gender representation, P18 expressed that increased inclusion feltshallow and performative: “[Many organizations are] jumping on the bandwagon, and when it actually comes down to support trans rights, they’re not there” (P18). Several participants reported that this kind of opportunistic rep-resentation, which they described as tokenizing, insincere, or pink-washing, was especially common during Pride Month, even from brands and organizations that otherwise did not otherwise make an effort to include queer customers among their customer base: “During Pride Month in New York, where there were a lot of ads Ifelt didn’t really target me correctly—they were just like, here’s the corporation, we put a rainbow logo on it” (P5).4.2.4 Queer people suffer emotional harms due to ad targeting.I think it’s the ads that are creating unrealistic image of our community and of ourselves.

Examples of codes included: “binary gender norms”, “control/autonomy”, “lacking nuance”, and“feels creepy”.Themes were collaboratively synthesized based on the most prevalent codes, developed narratively, and divided into three major sets of insights pertaining to participants’ views on ad content, ad targeting as it currently exists, and ideals and alternatives they envisioned. We re-referenced the interview transcripts to refine and finalize themes, ensuring they emerged as directly as possible from our data. This study involves data collection with LGBTQ+ individuals, a group that has specific privacy and safety concerns. This is espe-cially true given the range of risks faced by some queer people due to their nationalities (homosexuality is still criminalized in some countries [57]), gender identities (transgender people, especially transfeminine people of color, face a disproportionate risk of vio-lence [22]), and other attributes. We, the research team, took care of our recruitment, data collection, and analysis to retain their con-fidentiality, including not requiring participants to provide their legal names, compensating them using gift cards not attached to their legal identities, and ensuring that only the research team had access to the transcripts and recordings. Additionally, we acknowl-edge the tensions and risks inherent to conducting research focused on marginalized communities and individuals [40]. Our resulting analysis is not only shaped by a theoretical grounding in queer and feminist theory, but each author’s individual experiences as a per-son marginalized along the axes of gender, race, sexuality, ethnicity,and other identities (with overlaps and privileges therein). We divide our findings regarding ad content into three main points:the overarching lack of representations of queerness, stereotypical-ity when such identities were seen in ads, and the particular lack of representation faced by those with multiple marginalized identities.4.1.1 Participants’ ads reflect heterosexual societal norms. Although participants did widely report receiving ads targeted to them that depicted queer people, across the board they reported that many or most of the ads they saw were instead reflective of dominant hetero-sexual societal norms. P5 summarized, “I think there is starting to become change, but I see a lot of ... stereotypically, traditionally beau-tiful [people in ads] who are tall, or thin, or white, or able-bodied,etc.” (P5). This was echoed by other participants; P16 described the people they saw as being “generally either thin white men or thin white women. Generally attractive people” (P16). Another, despite seeing some ads geared towards queer people, noted that “most of the ads I see I typically feature straight couples” (P2). This aligns with prior work about ads’ reflections of dominant culture [60].4.1.2 Representations of queerness perpetuate stereotypes. The overall lack of queer representation was exacerbated by the heavy pres-ence of stereotypes in targeted ads seemingly intended to interestqueer consumers. In line with Kates [36]’s assessment that advertis-ing as an activity reflects dominant discourses, P1 described feeling caricatured: “It’s like the stereotype of what a gay man is ... like super dramatized, a point where I’m like, I don’t know anybody who acts like that. [...] I don’t know who’s relating to that; it’s [how]straight people think gay people act” (P1).More specifically, participants mentioned seeing stereotypes relating queerness to promiscuity and substance use. P6 describe some of the ads they saw as “hypersexualized”: “The advertisements are all, like, nightclub lighting, like all of these hot 32-year-old with basically all their clothes off, dancing and making out with each other” (P6). They clarified, “I don’t think that’s bad, it looks like they’re having a great time, but it’s really weird. I’m not sure if I consider it offensive or not.” Another described the ads they saw representing queer people as “pertaining to drinking, like fo rbeers” (P15). Unfortunately, this is nothing new; as prior literature has recorded, and some of our older participants remembered, such stereotypes reflect historical patterns in advertising [60]. P13 (age41) noted, “It used to be [that] alcohol and cigarettes were the only companies [with] gay [representation in] ads, so that felt a little stigmatizing” (P13).Other participants also felt misrepresented by content that, de-spite featuring appropriate representations of queerness, did not align with their own personal queer identities. For instance, a high-femme lesbian participant pointed out that the queer-targeted ads she received made “incorrect assumptions” about her gender presentation: “While I am gay, that does not immediately imply that Iwant to dress androgynously” (P11).4.1.3 Lack of diversity especially impacts those with intersecting identities. The lack of diversity in ad content was especially notice-able for those holding multiple marginalized identities, including participants of color; trans, non-binary, and gender-nonconforming participants; those with disabilities; and fat participants. A majority of participants observed a lack of racial diversity in their targeted ads; both white and non-white participants had their targeted advertisements dominated by depictions of white people. P1, a gay Iraqi man, described his targeted ads as being centered on white Western lifestyles and perspectives, sharing,“Any identities outside of that are super hard to see, or they're super exaggerated” (P1). This was one of the most widely-reported themes; 14 out of 18 participants mentioned the overwhelming whiteness in their ads. Gender-nonconforming participants noted that even when systems accurately determined their gender identities, their targeted ads reflected heteropatriarchy assumptions about their experi-ences. P6, a non-binary lesbian, reflected on the inadequacy of the lesbian representation they saw in ads: “Where there’s a lesbian cou-ple, usually both women are white and very feminine [with] longhair—I don’t really think we’ll ever see that much butch [represen-tation] because of the way our culture constructs what a beautiful woman looks like” (P6). A non-binary participant reported, “I feel like [my ads] are targeted more towards trans men, or someonewho’s more masculine than I am” (P2). Participants also cited a lack of body diversity in the models they saw, in particular a lack of depictions of fatness and disability. Consistent with prior work [23], our participants considered this problematic: “I’m a fat person ... I’m part of a lot of groups for other fat people. I think a lot of ads show me weight loss [content]because they assume that ... I want to lose weight, so that’s one thing they get wrong” (P3). Another participant reported that their ads overlook “disability or chronic illness—I have some chronic illnesses and friends who do as well, and it can be hard to see ads that don’t represent your queer friend group” (P5). Aside from their concerns about ad content, all participants reflected some degree of awareness and discomfort with ad target-ing systems identifying them as queer, a type of inference they were easily able to identify: “[Unlike ads for straight people,] you can really tell the ad targeting is for queer people; [advertisers]make it so obvious” (P18). Their responses to these inference- and categorization-based systems’ treatment ranged from mild discom-fort to experiences of significant emotional harm.4.2.1 Ad targeting made participants feel unsettled and unsafe.While participants expressed frustration with targeted advertis-ing that missed the mark, they shared that that accurate targeting often felt “creepy” (P8), “disconcerting” (P13), and even “scary” (P3).Creepiness, in particular, was a recurring theme. P3 reported feeling torn between the desire for convenience and this creepiness: “I get kind of creeped out when [ad systems] seem like they know a lot of things about my life and my interests. [...] From convenience sake,I’ll be more likely to see things that I’d be interested in ... but then,on the other hand, I don’t like advertisements and how all these places are collecting personal data about me” (P3).Taking the same perspective from the opposite direction, P4described that misrepresentative content sometimes felt reassur-ing, in that the ad targeting system “doesn’t really know me” (P4).Feeling “seen” by targeted ad systems frequently felt as much like surveillance as inclusion. In the United Sates, where most majora's platforms are based, legal protection of queer identities is based on the right to privacy [30]; it is unsurprising, then, that queerpeople’s privacy concerns are highly specific, and connected to their larger concerns about their civil rights. P11, a lesbian transwoman who expressed a desire for ads more relevant to her transidentity, expressed simultaneous concern: “I just don’t love the idea that the internet sees me for me, because that’s kind of danger-ous sometimes. There are state legislatures and whole countries that have passed laws to try to make it difficult, if not straight-up impossible, for me to live” (P11).4.2.2 Participants made sense of ad targeting and its failures. Partic-ipants had many plausible hypotheses for the mechanisms behind their targeted ads, including their own behaviors (P18: “I like to do creative writing so I go to baby name websites to look for names for characters, and ... the ads might be thinking, oh this person is pregnant because they’re looking up baby names”), and advertisers lacking nuanced understandings of queerness (P1, a gay middle eastern man, described many of his ads as “completely alienating to other members of the community [besides white gay men]”).Another common explanation participants pointed to was the advertising industry itself. P14 described white-centric ad content as being reflective of “the nature of the advertising business”, as well as broader social norms: “A lot of the ads showcase white gay male models—cisgender, white models—which, I mean, that’s obviously problematic, but it’s also a reflection of kind of the hegemonic discourse that is almost always in queer spaces, right? Unless you’rein a particularly non-white space.” (P14)4.2.3 Corporate tokenization of queerness contributes to skepticism. I don’t want them to market toward me—like, I don't think that companies can have a genuine care about communities that I’m part of, so I’d rather they [not] before and try to just get my money. (P4)Many participants were attuned to the financial incentives for brands targeting queer customers. They found this motive oppor-tunistic and profit-seeking, describing it as undermining the value of representation: “They’re all trying to get me to buy things, that’swhat their end goal is, because capitalism. So I feel like that’s a root of problematic advertising, is that they don’t really care about the impact, they just want you to buy” (P3). In the context of trans-gender representation, P18 expressed that increased inclusion feltshallow and performative: “[Many organizations are] jumping on the bandwagon, and when it actually comes down to support trans rights, they’re not there” (P18). Several participants reported that this kind of opportunistic rep-resentation, which they described as tokenizing, insincere, or pink-washing, was especially common during Pride Month, even from brands and organizations that otherwise did not otherwise make an effort to include queer customers among their customer base: “During Pride Month in New York, where there were a lot of ads Ifelt didn’t really target me correctly—they were just like, here’s the corporation, we put a rainbow logo on it” (P5).4.2.4 Queer people suffer emotional harms due to ad targeting.I think it’s the ads that are creating unrealistic image of our community and of ourselves. (P8)As described in 4.1, participants found themselves targeted with some content that was obviously damaging, including ads for al-cohol (given that members of the LGBTQ+ community are dispro-portionately likely to suffer from substance abuse issues [50]), and those for weight loss (P3: “I would say, yeah, probably more so when I was younger than now, but still I would say [weight loss ads] probably do impact my body image issues”).Participants, especially (but not exclusively) those identifying as trans and non-binary, frequently reported feeling misgendered by their targeted ads. Misgendering—when the gendered elements of language used or the underlying inferences made about someone are incongruent with an individual’s gender identity—is a form of harm commonly experienced by transgender people, though it can occur to others as well [42]. One non-binary participant (who doesn't identify as a woman) described feeling misgendered by their ads:“I feel the misrepresentation the most when it has to do with babies,and I feel like those ads are always very gendered, very targeted towards women and society’s idea of [what] a mother or a womanist. [Those] ads make me feel very weird” (P2). Explaining the impact this has on their self-image, they said, “When I see ads, especially marriage- and pregnancy-related ads that are targeted towards women, it does make [me] feel like, oh no, is this how people[in real life] see me, if this is what my browsing data indicates?”(P2). A cisgender gay male participant also reported receiving ads targeted to women, and that this made him question his identity for a time: “I did struggle a lot with my gender identity for a while because when you’re constantly getting ... ads targeted for a female,I was like, how do I identify? [...] I think it does create a lot of confusion” (P1). This feeling of confusion was also echoed by anon-binary participant who reported that the oscillating gender essentialist extremes in their ads led them to conclude that these systems found their identity “confusing.” They explained, “For some reason I get a lot of ads related to pregnancy or having children.On the other end of the spectrum, I get a lot of ads for jocks straps,which I don’t really understand. But I think [the system is] very confused about what my gender is” (P18).In addition to these direct harms, participants also expressed experiencing more nebulous harm caused by ads acting as a reminder of power and privilege in society at large. As P12 thoughtfully put it, “If [ad targeting] took into account [queer] identities, I would feel like at least I’m recognized in society. But if they do not ... I[am reminded that] I’m left out, that many people do not accept me as who I am” (P12). In addition to understanding participants’ criticisms of ad targeting content and systems, we were interested in hearing their generative perspectives—changes they felt could improve their experiences with targeted ads. Proposed shifts included more diverse ad content,more transparency about the ad targeting process, more autonomy in the use and collection of people’s personal data, and the ability to forgo targeted advertising in its current form entirely.4.3.1 Queer people want more diversity in ad content.It has to be actually really nuanced and critical, it can't just be representation for the sake of making [brands]look better on the surface. (P4)We previously discussed participants’ frustration with the preva-lence of stereotypes in the content that they encountered. A solution many identified was to increase diverse representation in ad con-tent. Participants highlighted the need for more racially diverse depictions of queer people, and for more body diversity in general. P16 voiced a desire to see more “people of all different appearances and sizes and races and presentations. A lot of times people like myself—thin, white, [female-assigned] people ... are the kind of[non-binary] people getting attention in the media.”Even the participants most skeptical of targeted advertising impact on queer communities acknowledged the value that rep-resentation holds for queer people, especially for its role in the identity formation of queer youth:If there were to be more [queer] representation, I also think having [it normalize] our identities—how we look and how we identify, or who we are—having that normalized [for] someone who’s young, maybe younger than 12, [to] see this representation and feel some kind of connection to it. [...] That is monumental,and something I would advocate more for. (P15)Participants did, however, understand visibility as a double-edged sword, with the potential to impact public perceptions ofLGBTQ+ people and communities both positively and negatively—something supported by prior research in television and print ad-vertising [7, 64]. As P16 put it: “You have to watch what’s going on out there, because for some people that aren’t in the LGBT commu-nity their only exposure to queer people might be through these ads, and they might be basing their views off those ads”.Many participants noted that improved diversity should not bedone solely to improve a brand’s rapport with queer consumers.Instead, they expressed a desire for advertisers to include nuancedqueer representation in content with broad reach. To quote P2, “[Iwant] more queer people and queer relationship representation,just in mainstream ads—I feel like a lot of the queer ads I see are just for queer-specific things”. Moreover, they wanted advertisers to back up visual cues with action and not, in the words of P4, “before and try to just get my money.” P16 echoed the same sentiment,drawing on the idea of “rainbow capitalism” [13]: “I think if I go to the website and they were just using [queer imagery] to attract people and not following through—you know, rainbow capitalism—that would further turn me off from the product. But if they had marketing I felt represented in and also supported causes I believed in, I would be more likely to support them, for sure” (P16).4.3.2 Queer people want more transparency and autonomy.[It’s scary] how much we’re already monitored, and how much [ad systems] already know about me. [...] [I Would prefer] increasing the amount of diversity within advertisements, without necessarily needing to know for sure if somebody identifies a certain way. (P15)The current user experience of ad platforms leaves little room for direct user input, a power differential noted by our participants.They were highly critical of the inference and categorization done by these systems and the lack of room for self-determination. They Suggested alternatives, including greater transparency about how they were being targeted, the ability to express boundaries or dis-content with certain ad content, and control over which advertisers could bid for their attention. For example, P1 began, “I wish [ads]in general communicated why they’re showing an ad to you” andalso described wanting “autonomy over whether or not I want to disclose a certain part of my identity on my own terms ... rather than just being tracked” (P1).P6 picked up this theme, describing unease with “the sense of being watched, being tracked,” and pointing out the particular pri-vacy needs of many LGBT people that are not publicly out: “If You're not out yet, [you might] be afraid that your mom’s going tobe looking over your shoulder [while you are] scrolling throughInstagram” (P6). Other participants also mentioned concerns about security and privacy online, including P14: “I think in the globalInternet age everyone is very, very concerned about privacy and security. I don’t know what to do about that—and this is again working with the assumption that I must live with [targeted] ads. I Would rather have companies ask me [instead of inferring] ... so I Can just decline” (P14).4.3.3 Queer people imagine the ability to opt out entirely. Partic-ipants’ desire for autonomy frequently stemmed from a wish to escape ad targeting systems altogether. One participant made clear their desire to avoid ad targeting specifically, despite being com-fortable and even interested in other types of ads: “Get rid of [it]... I feel like people around me don’t shop based on seeing what-ever is available in ads. [Instead they] buy things because they become popular, or [when] a curator”—a “real person, influencer or otherwise”—“promotes an item” (P10). When asked what she would change about ads if she could change anything, P11 also said, “I Would probably get rid of it. If you gave me a magic wand that can change anything about online advertising, I wouldn’t have online advertising” (P11).",1713-17,this made him question his identity for a time,
25,NoRoomForUserInput,Perceived_Problem,"We conducted 18 semi-structured interviews over Zoom lasting between 30 and 45 minutes, which were recorded for transcription and analysis. Participants received a written consent form before the interviews and were compensated with a $15 Amazon gift card distributed via email afterward. Participants in this paper are identified by unique anonymous identifiers (P1 - P18) to maintain their privacy. Our study was reviewed and approved by the StanfordUniversity Institutional Review Board.In the interviews, we asked about participants’ experiences with online advertising in three parts: first asking questions about their experiences overall with online ads, second asking them to reflect on ad targeting and its relationship to various aspects of their iden-tities, and third relating to their identity as an LGBTQ+ person. The Complete interview guide is listed in Appendix A. At the close of the interview, we asked participants open-ended demographic ques-tions, having them provide any or all of the following in their own words: age, gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity, and nationality.Part 1: Online advertising. We asked participants which platforms they were most active on, how frequently they encountered ads on those platforms, and what types of advertising they encountered.We also sought to understand how and why participants engaged with ads they considered compelling, asking participants to recall an ad they had recently interacted with and reflect on the charac-teristics, including aspects of the images or text, that drew their attention.Part 2: Ad targeting. Next, to understand participants’ beliefs about what inferences ad platforms may be making and how they believe such inferences are made, we asked them to reflect on the kinds of themes, people, and other imagery they usually see in their targeted ads, and speculate as to why they receive such content. Wealso explored the relationship of this content with multiple aspects of their identities, asking about feelings of mis/representation and whether or not they wanted these identity aspects to be represented and/or inferred by ad targeting systems.Part 3: Targeted ads and LGBTQ+ identity. In our final set of interview questions, we explored participants’ perceptions of pos-itive and negative impacts on LGBTQ+ people and communities.In relation to negative impacts, we asked further questions about participants' knowledge and use of strategies for avoiding ad tar-geting, as well as what they would like to see changed (including more realistic and more speculative ideas). Though extant theoretical frameworks shaped our inquiries in this work, our goal was to let the patterns of our data guide our anal-ysis, so we chose a reflexive approach [11]. Initially, one author conducted line-by-line open coding of all transcripts to develop a codebook of keywords and sub-keywords. Using this codebook,another author took a second pass, coding the transcripts a second time and updating, replacing, or adding additional keywords as needed. The first coding pass was conducted using NVivo qual-itative analysis software, while the second was conducted usingDelve for better collaboration. After collaborative discussions of the coded content, these two authors came to a consensus about the final set of codes and coded content. Examples of codes included: “binary gender norms”, “control/autonomy”, “lacking nuance”, and“feels creepy”.Themes were collaboratively synthesized based on the most prevalent codes, developed narratively, and divided into three major sets of insights pertaining to participants’ views on ad content, ad targeting as it currently exists, and ideals and alternatives they envisioned.

One non-binary participant (who doesn't identify as a woman) described feeling misgendered by their ads:“I feel the misrepresentation the most when it has to do with babies,and I feel like those ads are always very gendered, very targeted towards women and society’s idea of [what] a mother or a womanist. [Those] ads make me feel very weird” (P2). Explaining the impact this has on their self-image, they said, “When I see ads, especially marriage- and pregnancy-related ads that are targeted towards women, it does make [me] feel like, oh no, is this how people[in real life] see me, if this is what my browsing data indicates?”(P2). A cisgender gay male participant also reported receiving ads targeted to women, and that this made him question his identity for a time: “I did struggle a lot with my gender identity for a while because when you’re constantly getting ... ads targeted for a female,I was like, how do I identify? [...] I think it does create a lot of confusion” (P1). This feeling of confusion was also echoed by anon-binary participant who reported that the oscillating gender essentialist extremes in their ads led them to conclude that these systems found their identity “confusing.” They explained, “For some reason I get a lot of ads related to pregnancy or having children.On the other end of the spectrum, I get a lot of ads for jocks straps,which I don’t really understand. But I think [the system is] very confused about what my gender is” (P18).In addition to these direct harms, participants also expressed experiencing more nebulous harm caused by ads acting as a reminder of power and privilege in society at large. As P12 thoughtfully put it, “If [ad targeting] took into account [queer] identities, I would feel like at least I’m recognized in society. But if they do not ... I[am reminded that] I’m left out, that many people do not accept me as who I am” (P12). In addition to understanding participants’ criticisms of ad targeting content and systems, we were interested in hearing their generative perspectives—changes they felt could improve their experiences with targeted ads. Proposed shifts included more diverse ad content,more transparency about the ad targeting process, more autonomy in the use and collection of people’s personal data, and the ability to forgo targeted advertising in its current form entirely.4.3.1 Queer people want more diversity in ad content.It has to be actually really nuanced and critical, it can't just be representation for the sake of making [brands]look better on the surface. (P4)We previously discussed participants’ frustration with the preva-lence of stereotypes in the content that they encountered. A solution many identified was to increase diverse representation in ad con-tent. Participants highlighted the need for more racially diverse depictions of queer people, and for more body diversity in general. P16 voiced a desire to see more “people of all different appearances and sizes and races and presentations. A lot of times people like myself—thin, white, [female-assigned] people ... are the kind of[non-binary] people getting attention in the media.”Even the participants most skeptical of targeted advertising impact on queer communities acknowledged the value that rep-resentation holds for queer people, especially for its role in the identity formation of queer youth:If there were to be more [queer] representation, I also think having [it normalize] our identities—how we look and how we identify, or who we are—having that normalized [for] someone who’s young, maybe younger than 12, [to] see this representation and feel some kind of connection to it. [...] That is monumental,and something I would advocate more for. (P15)Participants did, however, understand visibility as a double-edged sword, with the potential to impact public perceptions ofLGBTQ+ people and communities both positively and negatively—something supported by prior research in television and print ad-vertising [7, 64]. As P16 put it: “You have to watch what’s going on out there, because for some people that aren’t in the LGBT commu-nity their only exposure to queer people might be through these ads, and they might be basing their views off those ads”.Many participants noted that improved diversity should not bedone solely to improve a brand’s rapport with queer consumers.Instead, they expressed a desire for advertisers to include nuancedqueer representation in content with broad reach. To quote P2, “[Iwant] more queer people and queer relationship representation,just in mainstream ads—I feel like a lot of the queer ads I see are just for queer-specific things”. Moreover, they wanted advertisers to back up visual cues with action and not, in the words of P4, “before and try to just get my money.” P16 echoed the same sentiment,drawing on the idea of “rainbow capitalism” [13]: “I think if I go to the website and they were just using [queer imagery] to attract people and not following through—you know, rainbow capitalism—that would further turn me off from the product. But if they had marketing I felt represented in and also supported causes I believed in, I would be more likely to support them, for sure” (P16).4.3.2 Queer people want more transparency and autonomy.[It’s scary] how much we’re already monitored, and how much [ad systems] already know about me. [...] [I Would prefer] increasing the amount of diversity within advertisements, without necessarily needing to know for sure if somebody identifies a certain way. (P15)The current user experience of ad platforms leaves little room for direct user input, a power differential noted by our participants.They were highly critical of the inference and categorization done by these systems and the lack of room for self-determination. They Suggested alternatives, including greater transparency about how they were being targeted, the ability to express boundaries or dis-content with certain ad content, and control over which advertisers could bid for their attention. For example, P1 began, “I wish [ads]in general communicated why they’re showing an ad to you” andalso described wanting “autonomy over whether or not I want to disclose a certain part of my identity on my own terms ... rather than just being tracked” (P1).P6 picked up this theme, describing unease with “the sense of being watched, being tracked,” and pointing out the particular pri-vacy needs of many LGBT people that are not publicly out: “If You're not out yet, [you might] be afraid that your mom’s going tobe looking over your shoulder [while you are] scrolling throughInstagram” (P6). Other participants also mentioned concerns about security and privacy online, including P14: “I think in the globalInternet age everyone is very, very concerned about privacy and security. I don’t know what to do about that—and this is again working with the assumption that I must live with [targeted] ads. I Would rather have companies ask me [instead of inferring] ... so I Can just decline” (P14).4.3.3 Queer people imagine the ability to opt out entirely. Partic-ipants’ desire for autonomy frequently stemmed from a wish to escape ad targeting systems altogether. One participant made clear their desire to avoid ad targeting specifically, despite being com-fortable and even interested in other types of ads: “Get rid of [it]... I feel like people around me don’t shop based on seeing what-ever is available in ads. [Instead they] buy things because they become popular, or [when] a curator”—a “real person, influencer or otherwise”—“promotes an item” (P10). When asked what she would change about ads if she could change anything, P11 also said, “I Would probably get rid of it. If you gave me a magic wand that can change anything about online advertising, I wouldn’t have online advertising” (P11).",1713-17,little room for direct user inpu,

29,HeteronormativityInAdvertising,constrainsAgent,LGBTQParticipants,"We conducted 18 semi-structured interviews over Zoom lasting between 30 and 45 minutes, which were recorded for transcription and analysis. Participants received a written consent form before the interviews and were compensated with a $15 Amazon gift card distributed via email afterward. Participants in this paper are identified by unique anonymous identifiers (P1 - P18) to maintain their privacy. Our study was reviewed and approved by the StanfordUniversity Institutional Review Board.In the interviews, we asked about participants’ experiences with online advertising in three parts: first asking questions about their experiences overall with online ads, second asking them to reflect on ad targeting and its relationship to various aspects of their iden-tities, and third relating to their identity as an LGBTQ+ person. The Complete interview guide is listed in Appendix A. At the close of the interview, we asked participants open-ended demographic ques-tions, having them provide any or all of the following in their own words: age, gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity, and nationality.Part 1: Online advertising. We asked participants which platforms they were most active on, how frequently they encountered ads on those platforms, and what types of advertising they encountered.We also sought to understand how and why participants engaged with ads they considered compelling, asking participants to recall an ad they had recently interacted with and reflect on the charac-teristics, including aspects of the images or text, that drew their attention.Part 2: Ad targeting. Next, to understand participants’ beliefs about what inferences ad platforms may be making and how they believe such inferences are made, we asked them to reflect on the kinds of themes, people, and other imagery they usually see in their targeted ads, and speculate as to why they receive such content. Wealso explored the relationship of this content with multiple aspects of their identities, asking about feelings of mis/representation and whether or not they wanted these identity aspects to be represented and/or inferred by ad targeting systems.Part 3: Targeted ads and LGBTQ+ identity. In our final set of interview questions, we explored participants’ perceptions of pos-itive and negative impacts on LGBTQ+ people and communities.In relation to negative impacts, we asked further questions about participants' knowledge and use of strategies for avoiding ad tar-geting, as well as what they would like to see changed (including more realistic and more speculative ideas). Though extant theoretical frameworks shaped our inquiries in this work, our goal was to let the patterns of our data guide our anal-ysis, so we chose a reflexive approach [11]. Initially, one author conducted line-by-line open coding of all transcripts to develop a codebook of keywords and sub-keywords. Using this codebook,another author took a second pass, coding the transcripts a second time and updating, replacing, or adding additional keywords as needed. The first coding pass was conducted using NVivo qual-itative analysis software, while the second was conducted usingDelve for better collaboration. After collaborative discussions of the coded content, these two authors came to a consensus about the final set of codes and coded content. Examples of codes included: “binary gender norms”, “control/autonomy”, “lacking nuance”, and“feels creepy”.Themes were collaboratively synthesized based on the most prevalent codes, developed narratively, and divided into three major sets of insights pertaining to participants’ views on ad content, ad targeting as it currently exists, and ideals and alternatives they envisioned. We re-referenced the interview transcripts to refine and finalize themes, ensuring they emerged as directly as possible from our data. This study involves data collection with LGBTQ+ individuals, a group that has specific privacy and safety concerns. This is espe-cially true given the range of risks faced by some queer people due to their nationalities (homosexuality is still criminalized in some countries [57]), gender identities (transgender people, especially transfeminine people of color, face a disproportionate risk of vio-lence [22]), and other attributes. We, the research team, took care of our recruitment, data collection, and analysis to retain their con-fidentiality, including not requiring participants to provide their legal names, compensating them using gift cards not attached to their legal identities, and ensuring that only the research team had access to the transcripts and recordings. Additionally, we acknowl-edge the tensions and risks inherent to conducting research focused on marginalized communities and individuals [40]. Our resulting analysis is not only shaped by a theoretical grounding in queer and feminist theory, but each author’s individual experiences as a per-son marginalized along the axes of gender, race, sexuality, ethnicity,and other identities (with overlaps and privileges therein). We divide our findings regarding ad content into three main points:the overarching lack of representations of queerness, stereotypical-ity when such identities were seen in ads, and the particular lack of representation faced by those with multiple marginalized identities.4.1.1 Participants’ ads reflect heterosexual societal norms. Although participants did widely report receiving ads targeted to them that depicted queer people, across the board they reported that many or most of the ads they saw were instead reflective of dominant hetero-sexual societal norms. P5 summarized, “I think there is starting to become change, but I see a lot of ... stereotypically, traditionally beau-tiful [people in ads] who are tall, or thin, or white, or able-bodied,etc.” (P5). This was echoed by other participants; P16 described the people they saw as being “generally either thin white men or thin white women. Generally attractive people” (P16). Another, despite seeing some ads geared towards queer people, noted that “most of the ads I see I typically feature straight couples” (P2). This aligns with prior work about ads’ reflections of dominant culture [60].4.1.2 Representations of queerness perpetuate stereotypes. The overall lack of queer representation was exacerbated by the heavy pres-ence of stereotypes in targeted ads seemingly intended to interestqueer consumers. In line with Kates [36]’s assessment that advertis-ing as an activity reflects dominant discourses, P1 described feeling caricatured: “It’s like the stereotype of what a gay man is ... like super dramatized, a point where I’m like, I don’t know anybody who acts like that. [...] I don’t know who’s relating to that; it’s [how]straight people think gay people act” (P1).More specifically, participants mentioned seeing stereotypes relating queerness to promiscuity and substance use. P6 describe some of the ads they saw as “hypersexualized”: “The advertisements are all, like, nightclub lighting, like all of these hot 32-year-old with basically all their clothes off, dancing and making out with each other” (P6). They clarified, “I don’t think that’s bad, it looks like they’re having a great time, but it’s really weird. I’m not sure if I consider it offensive or not.” Another described the ads they saw representing queer people as “pertaining to drinking, like fo rbeers” (P15). Unfortunately, this is nothing new; as prior literature has recorded, and some of our older participants remembered, such stereotypes reflect historical patterns in advertising [60]. P13 (age41) noted, “It used to be [that] alcohol and cigarettes were the only companies [with] gay [representation in] ads, so that felt a little stigmatizing” (P13).Other participants also felt misrepresented by content that, de-spite featuring appropriate representations of queerness, did not align with their own personal queer identities. For instance, a high-femme lesbian participant pointed out that the queer-targeted ads she received made “incorrect assumptions” about her gender presentation: “While I am gay, that does not immediately imply that Iwant to dress androgynously” (P11).4.1.3 Lack of diversity especially impacts those with intersecting identities. The lack of diversity in ad content was especially notice-able for those holding multiple marginalized identities, including participants of color; trans, non-binary, and gender-nonconforming participants; those with disabilities; and fat participants. A majority of participants observed a lack of racial diversity in their targeted ads; both white and non-white participants had their targeted advertisements dominated by depictions of white people. P1, a gay Iraqi man, described his targeted ads as being centered on white Western lifestyles and perspectives, sharing,“Any identities outside of that are super hard to see, or they're super exaggerated” (P1). This was one of the most widely-reported themes; 14 out of 18 participants mentioned the overwhelming whiteness in their ads. Gender-nonconforming participants noted that even when systems accurately determined their gender identities, their targeted ads reflected heteropatriarchy assumptions about their experi-ences. P6, a non-binary lesbian, reflected on the inadequacy of the lesbian representation they saw in ads: “Where there’s a lesbian cou-ple, usually both women are white and very feminine [with] longhair—I don’t really think we’ll ever see that much butch [represen-tation] because of the way our culture constructs what a beautiful woman looks like” (P6). A non-binary participant reported, “I feel like [my ads] are targeted more towards trans men, or someonewho’s more masculine than I am” (P2). Participants also cited a lack of body diversity in the models they saw, in particular a lack of depictions of fatness and disability. Consistent with prior work [23], our participants considered this problematic: “I’m a fat person ... I’m part of a lot of groups for other fat people. I think a lot of ads show me weight loss [content]because they assume that ... I want to lose weight, so that’s one thing they get wrong” (P3). Another participant reported that their ads overlook “disability or chronic illness—I have some chronic illnesses and friends who do as well, and it can be hard to see ads that don’t represent your queer friend group” (P5). Aside from their concerns about ad content, all participants reflected some degree of awareness and discomfort with ad target-ing systems identifying them as queer, a type of inference they were easily able to identify: “[Unlike ads for straight people,] you can really tell the ad targeting is for queer people; [advertisers]make it so obvious” (P18). Their responses to these inference- and categorization-based systems’ treatment ranged from mild discom-fort to experiences of significant emotional harm.4.2.1 Ad targeting made participants feel unsettled and unsafe.While participants expressed frustration with targeted advertis-ing that missed the mark, they shared that that accurate targeting often felt “creepy” (P8), “disconcerting” (P13), and even “scary” (P3).Creepiness, in particular, was a recurring theme. P3 reported feeling torn between the desire for convenience and this creepiness: “I get kind of creeped out when [ad systems] seem like they know a lot of things about my life and my interests. [...] From convenience sake,I’ll be more likely to see things that I’d be interested in ... but then,on the other hand, I don’t like advertisements and how all these places are collecting personal data about me” (P3).Taking the same perspective from the opposite direction, P4described that misrepresentative content sometimes felt reassur-ing, in that the ad targeting system “doesn’t really know me” (P4).Feeling “seen” by targeted ad systems frequently felt as much like surveillance as inclusion. In the United Sates, where most majora's platforms are based, legal protection of queer identities is based on the right to privacy [30]; it is unsurprising, then, that queerpeople’s privacy concerns are highly specific, and connected to their larger concerns about their civil rights. P11, a lesbian transwoman who expressed a desire for ads more relevant to her transidentity, expressed simultaneous concern: “I just don’t love the idea that the internet sees me for me, because that’s kind of danger-ous sometimes. There are state legislatures and whole countries that have passed laws to try to make it difficult, if not straight-up impossible, for me to live” (P11).4.2.2 Participants made sense of ad targeting and its failures. Partic-ipants had many plausible hypotheses for the mechanisms behind their targeted ads, including their own behaviors (P18: “I like to do creative writing so I go to baby name websites to look for names for characters, and ... the ads might be thinking, oh this person is pregnant because they’re looking up baby names”), and advertisers lacking nuanced understandings of queerness (P1, a gay middle eastern man, described many of his ads as “completely alienating to other members of the community [besides white gay men]”).Another common explanation participants pointed to was the advertising industry itself. P14 described white-centric ad content as being reflective of “the nature of the advertising business”, as well as broader social norms: “A lot of the ads showcase white gay male models—cisgender, white models—which, I mean, that’s obviously problematic, but it’s also a reflection of kind of the hegemonic discourse that is almost always in queer spaces, right? Unless you’rein a particularly non-white space.” (P14)4.2.3 Corporate tokenization of queerness contributes to skepticism. I don’t want them to market toward me—like, I don't think that companies can have a genuine care about communities that I’m part of, so I’d rather they [not] before and try to just get my money. (P4)Many participants were attuned to the financial incentives for brands targeting queer customers. They found this motive oppor-tunistic and profit-seeking, describing it as undermining the value of representation: “They’re all trying to get me to buy things, that’swhat their end goal is, because capitalism. So I feel like that’s a root of problematic advertising, is that they don’t really care about the impact, they just want you to buy” (P3). In the context of trans-gender representation, P18 expressed that increased inclusion feltshallow and performative: “[Many organizations are] jumping on the bandwagon, and when it actually comes down to support trans rights, they’re not there” (P18). Several participants reported that this kind of opportunistic rep-resentation, which they described as tokenizing, insincere, or pink-washing, was especially common during Pride Month, even from brands and organizations that otherwise did not otherwise make an effort to include queer customers among their customer base: “During Pride Month in New York, where there were a lot of ads Ifelt didn’t really target me correctly—they were just like, here’s the corporation, we put a rainbow logo on it” (P5).4.2.4 Queer people suffer emotional harms due to ad targeting.I think it’s the ads that are creating unrealistic image of our community and of ourselves. (P8)As described in 4.1, participants found themselves targeted with some content that was obviously damaging, including ads for al-cohol (given that members of the LGBTQ+ community are dispro-portionately likely to suffer from substance abuse issues [50]), and those for weight loss (P3: “I would say, yeah, probably more so when I was younger than now, but still I would say [weight loss ads] probably do impact my body image issues”).Participants, especially (but not exclusively) those identifying as trans and non-binary, frequently reported feeling misgendered by their targeted ads. Misgendering—when the gendered elements of language used or the underlying inferences made about someone are incongruent with an individual’s gender identity—is a form of harm commonly experienced by transgender people, though it can occur to others as well [42]. One non-binary participant (who doesn't identify as a woman) described feeling misgendered by their ads:“I feel the misrepresentation the most when it has to do with babies,and I feel like those ads are always very gendered, very targeted towards women and society’s idea of [what] a mother or a womanist. [Those] ads make me feel very weird” (P2). Explaining the impact this has on their self-image, they said, “When I see ads, especially marriage- and pregnancy-related ads that are targeted towards women, it does make [me] feel like, oh no, is this how people[in real life] see me, if this is what my browsing data indicates?”(P2). A cisgender gay male participant also reported receiving ads targeted to women, and that this made him question his identity for a time: “I did struggle a lot with my gender identity for a while because when you’re constantly getting ... ads targeted for a female,I was like, how do I identify? [...] I think it does create a lot of confusion” (P1). This feeling of confusion was also echoed by anon-binary participant who reported that the oscillating gender essentialist extremes in their ads led them to conclude that these systems found their identity “confusing.” They explained, “For some reason I get a lot of ads related to pregnancy or having children.On the other end of the spectrum, I get a lot of ads for jocks straps,which I don’t really understand. But I think [the system is] very confused about what my gender is” (P18).In addition to these direct harms, participants also expressed experiencing more nebulous harm caused by ads acting as a reminder of power and privilege in society at large.

I[am reminded that] I’m left out, that many people do not accept me as who I am” (P12). In addition to understanding participants’ criticisms of ad targeting content and systems, we were interested in hearing their generative perspectives—changes they felt could improve their experiences with targeted ads. Proposed shifts included more diverse ad content,more transparency about the ad targeting process, more autonomy in the use and collection of people’s personal data, and the ability to forgo targeted advertising in its current form entirely.4.3.1 Queer people want more diversity in ad content.It has to be actually really nuanced and critical, it can't just be representation for the sake of making [brands]look better on the surface.

This is espe-cially true given the range of risks faced by some queer people due to their nationalities (homosexuality is still criminalized in some countries [57]), gender identities (transgender people, especially transfeminine people of color, face a disproportionate risk of vio-lence [22]), and other attributes. We, the research team, took care of our recruitment, data collection, and analysis to retain their con-fidentiality, including not requiring participants to provide their legal names, compensating them using gift cards not attached to their legal identities, and ensuring that only the research team had access to the transcripts and recordings. Additionally, we acknowl-edge the tensions and risks inherent to conducting research focused on marginalized communities and individuals [40]. Our resulting analysis is not only shaped by a theoretical grounding in queer and feminist theory, but each author’s individual experiences as a per-son marginalized along the axes of gender, race, sexuality, ethnicity,and other identities (with overlaps and privileges therein). We divide our findings regarding ad content into three main points:the overarching lack of representations of queerness, stereotypical-ity when such identities were seen in ads, and the particular lack of representation faced by those with multiple marginalized identities.4.1.1 Participants’ ads reflect heterosexual societal norms. Although participants did widely report receiving ads targeted to them that depicted queer people, across the board they reported that many or most of the ads they saw were instead reflective of dominant hetero-sexual societal norms. P5 summarized, “I think there is starting to become change, but I see a lot of ... stereotypically, traditionally beau-tiful [people in ads] who are tall, or thin, or white, or able-bodied,etc.” (P5). This was echoed by other participants; P16 described the people they saw as being “generally either thin white men or thin white women. Generally attractive people” (P16). Another, despite seeing some ads geared towards queer people, noted that “most of the ads I see I typically feature straight couples” (P2). This aligns with prior work about ads’ reflections of dominant culture [60].4.1.2 Representations of queerness perpetuate stereotypes. The overall lack of queer representation was exacerbated by the heavy pres-ence of stereotypes in targeted ads seemingly intended to interestqueer consumers. In line with Kates [36]’s assessment that advertis-ing as an activity reflects dominant discourses, P1 described feeling caricatured: “It’s like the stereotype of what a gay man is ... like super dramatized, a point where I’m like, I don’t know anybody who acts like that. [...] I don’t know who’s relating to that; it’s [how]straight people think gay people act” (P1).More specifically, participants mentioned seeing stereotypes relating queerness to promiscuity and substance use. P6 describe some of the ads they saw as “hypersexualized”: “The advertisements are all, like, nightclub lighting, like all of these hot 32-year-old with basically all their clothes off, dancing and making out with each other” (P6). They clarified, “I don’t think that’s bad, it looks like they’re having a great time, but it’s really weird. I’m not sure if I consider it offensive or not.” Another described the ads they saw representing queer people as “pertaining to drinking, like fo rbeers” (P15). Unfortunately, this is nothing new; as prior literature has recorded, and some of our older participants remembered, such stereotypes reflect historical patterns in advertising [60]. P13 (age41) noted, “It used to be [that] alcohol and cigarettes were the only companies [with] gay [representation in] ads, so that felt a little stigmatizing” (P13).Other participants also felt misrepresented by content that, de-spite featuring appropriate representations of queerness, did not align with their own personal queer identities. For instance, a high-femme lesbian participant pointed out that the queer-targeted ads she received made “incorrect assumptions” about her gender presentation: “While I am gay, that does not immediately imply that Iwant to dress androgynously” (P11).4.1.3 Lack of diversity especially impacts those with intersecting identities. The lack of diversity in ad content was especially notice-able for those holding multiple marginalized identities, including participants of color; trans, non-binary, and gender-nonconforming participants; those with disabilities; and fat participants. A majority of participants observed a lack of racial diversity in their targeted ads; both white and non-white participants had their targeted advertisements dominated by depictions of white people. P1, a gay Iraqi man, described his targeted ads as being centered on white Western lifestyles and perspectives, sharing,“Any identities outside of that are super hard to see, or they're super exaggerated” (P1). This was one of the most widely-reported themes; 14 out of 18 participants mentioned the overwhelming whiteness in their ads. Gender-nonconforming participants noted that even when systems accurately determined their gender identities, their targeted ads reflected heteropatriarchy assumptions about their experi-ences. P6, a non-binary lesbian, reflected on the inadequacy of the lesbian representation they saw in ads: “Where there’s a lesbian cou-ple, usually both women are white and very feminine [with] longhair—I don’t really think we’ll ever see that much butch [represen-tation] because of the way our culture constructs what a beautiful woman looks like” (P6). A non-binary participant reported, “I feel like [my ads] are targeted more towards trans men, or someonewho’s more masculine than I am” (P2). Participants also cited a lack of body diversity in the models they saw, in particular a lack of depictions of fatness and disability. Consistent with prior work [23], our participants considered this problematic: “I’m a fat person ... I’m part of a lot of groups for other fat people. I think a lot of ads show me weight loss [content]because they assume that ... I want to lose weight, so that’s one thing they get wrong” (P3). Another participant reported that their ads overlook “disability or chronic illness—I have some chronic illnesses and friends who do as well, and it can be hard to see ads that don’t represent your queer friend group” (P5). Aside from their concerns about ad content, all participants reflected some degree of awareness and discomfort with ad target-ing systems identifying them as queer, a type of inference they were easily able to identify: “[Unlike ads for straight people,] you can really tell the ad targeting is for queer people; [advertisers]make it so obvious” (P18). Their responses to these inference- and categorization-based systems’ treatment ranged from mild discom-fort to experiences of significant emotional harm.4.2.1 Ad targeting made participants feel unsettled and unsafe.While participants expressed frustration with targeted advertis-ing that missed the mark, they shared that that accurate targeting often felt “creepy” (P8), “disconcerting” (P13), and even “scary” (P3).Creepiness, in particular, was a recurring theme. P3 reported feeling torn between the desire for convenience and this creepiness: “I get kind of creeped out when [ad systems] seem like they know a lot of things about my life and my interests. [...] From convenience sake,I’ll be more likely to see things that I’d be interested in ... but then,on the other hand, I don’t like advertisements and how all these places are collecting personal data about me” (P3).Taking the same perspective from the opposite direction, P4described that misrepresentative content sometimes felt reassur-ing, in that the ad targeting system “doesn’t really know me” (P4).Feeling “seen” by targeted ad systems frequently felt as much like surveillance as inclusion. In the United Sates, where most majora's platforms are based, legal protection of queer identities is based on the right to privacy [30]; it is unsurprising, then, that queerpeople’s privacy concerns are highly specific, and connected to their larger concerns about their civil rights. P11, a lesbian transwoman who expressed a desire for ads more relevant to her transidentity, expressed simultaneous concern: “I just don’t love the idea that the internet sees me for me, because that’s kind of danger-ous sometimes. There are state legislatures and whole countries that have passed laws to try to make it difficult, if not straight-up impossible, for me to live” (P11).4.2.2 Participants made sense of ad targeting and its failures. Partic-ipants had many plausible hypotheses for the mechanisms behind their targeted ads, including their own behaviors (P18: “I like to do creative writing so I go to baby name websites to look for names for characters, and ... the ads might be thinking, oh this person is pregnant because they’re looking up baby names”), and advertisers lacking nuanced understandings of queerness (P1, a gay middle eastern man, described many of his ads as “completely alienating to other members of the community [besides white gay men]”).Another common explanation participants pointed to was the advertising industry itself. P14 described white-centric ad content as being reflective of “the nature of the advertising business”, as well as broader social norms: “A lot of the ads showcase white gay male models—cisgender, white models—which, I mean, that’s obviously problematic, but it’s also a reflection of kind of the hegemonic discourse that is almost always in queer spaces, right? Unless you’rein a particularly non-white space.” (P14)4.2.3 Corporate tokenization of queerness contributes to skepticism. I don’t want them to market toward me—like, I don't think that companies can have a genuine care about communities that I’m part of, so I’d rather they [not] before and try to just get my money. (P4)Many participants were attuned to the financial incentives for brands targeting queer customers. They found this motive oppor-tunistic and profit-seeking, describing it as undermining the value of representation: “They’re all trying to get me to buy things, that’swhat their end goal is, because capitalism. So I feel like that’s a root of problematic advertising, is that they don’t really care about the impact, they just want you to buy” (P3). In the context of trans-gender representation, P18 expressed that increased inclusion feltshallow and performative: “[Many organizations are] jumping on the bandwagon, and when it actually comes down to support trans rights, they’re not there” (P18). Several participants reported that this kind of opportunistic rep-resentation, which they described as tokenizing, insincere, or pink-washing, was especially common during Pride Month, even from brands and organizations that otherwise did not otherwise make an effort to include queer customers among their customer base: “During Pride Month in New York, where there were a lot of ads Ifelt didn’t really target me correctly—they were just like, here’s the corporation, we put a rainbow logo on it” (P5).4.2.4 Queer people suffer emotional harms due to ad targeting.I think it’s the ads that are creating unrealistic image of our community and of ourselves. (P8)As described in 4.1, participants found themselves targeted with some content that was obviously damaging, including ads for al-cohol (given that members of the LGBTQ+ community are dispro-portionately likely to suffer from substance abuse issues [50]), and those for weight loss (P3: “I would say, yeah, probably more so when I was younger than now, but still I would say [weight loss ads] probably do impact my body image issues”).Participants, especially (but not exclusively) those identifying as trans and non-binary, frequently reported feeling misgendered by their targeted ads. Misgendering—when the gendered elements of language used or the underlying inferences made about someone are incongruent with an individual’s gender identity—is a form of harm commonly experienced by transgender people, though it can occur to others as well [42]. One non-binary participant (who doesn't identify as a woman) described feeling misgendered by their ads:“I feel the misrepresentation the most when it has to do with babies,and I feel like those ads are always very gendered, very targeted towards women and society’s idea of [what] a mother or a womanist. [Those] ads make me feel very weird” (P2). Explaining the impact this has on their self-image, they said, “When I see ads, especially marriage- and pregnancy-related ads that are targeted towards women, it does make [me] feel like, oh no, is this how people[in real life] see me, if this is what my browsing data indicates?”(P2). A cisgender gay male participant also reported receiving ads targeted to women, and that this made him question his identity for a time: “I did struggle a lot with my gender identity for a while because when you’re constantly getting ... ads targeted for a female,I was like, how do I identify? [...] I think it does create a lot of confusion” (P1). This feeling of confusion was also echoed by anon-binary participant who reported that the oscillating gender essentialist extremes in their ads led them to conclude that these systems found their identity “confusing.” They explained, “For some reason I get a lot of ads related to pregnancy or having children.On the other end of the spectrum, I get a lot of ads for jocks straps,which I don’t really understand. But I think [the system is] very confused about what my gender is” (P18).In addition to these direct harms, participants also expressed experiencing more nebulous harm caused by ads acting as a reminder of power and privilege in society at large. As P12 thoughtfully put it, “If [ad targeting] took into account [queer] identities, I would feel like at least I’m recognized in society. But if they do not ... I[am reminded that] I’m left out, that many people do not accept me as who I am” (P12). In addition to understanding participants’ criticisms of ad targeting content and systems, we were interested in hearing their generative perspectives—changes they felt could improve their experiences with targeted ads. Proposed shifts included more diverse ad content,more transparency about the ad targeting process, more autonomy in the use and collection of people’s personal data, and the ability to forgo targeted advertising in its current form entirely.4.3.1 Queer people want more diversity in ad content.It has to be actually really nuanced and critical, it can't just be representation for the sake of making [brands]look better on the surface. (P4)We previously discussed participants’ frustration with the preva-lence of stereotypes in the content that they encountered. A solution many identified was to increase diverse representation in ad con-tent. Participants highlighted the need for more racially diverse depictions of queer people, and for more body diversity in general. P16 voiced a desire to see more “people of all different appearances and sizes and races and presentations. A lot of times people like myself—thin, white, [female-assigned] people ... are the kind of[non-binary] people getting attention in the media.”Even the participants most skeptical of targeted advertising impact on queer communities acknowledged the value that rep-resentation holds for queer people, especially for its role in the identity formation of queer youth:If there were to be more [queer] representation, I also think having [it normalize] our identities—how we look and how we identify, or who we are—having that normalized [for] someone who’s young, maybe younger than 12, [to] see this representation and feel some kind of connection to it. [...] That is monumental,and something I would advocate more for. (P15)Participants did, however, understand visibility as a double-edged sword, with the potential to impact public perceptions ofLGBTQ+ people and communities both positively and negatively—something supported by prior research in television and print ad-vertising [7, 64]. As P16 put it: “You have to watch what’s going on out there, because for some people that aren’t in the LGBT commu-nity their only exposure to queer people might be through these ads, and they might be basing their views off those ads”.Many participants noted that improved diversity should not bedone solely to improve a brand’s rapport with queer consumers.Instead, they expressed a desire for advertisers to include nuancedqueer representation in content with broad reach. To quote P2, “[Iwant] more queer people and queer relationship representation,just in mainstream ads—I feel like a lot of the queer ads I see are just for queer-specific things”. Moreover, they wanted advertisers to back up visual cues with action and not, in the words of P4, “before and try to just get my money.” P16 echoed the same sentiment,drawing on the idea of “rainbow capitalism” [13]: “I think if I go to the website and they were just using [queer imagery] to attract people and not following through—you know, rainbow capitalism—that would further turn me off from the product. But if they had marketing I felt represented in and also supported causes I believed in, I would be more likely to support them, for sure” (P16).4.3.2 Queer people want more transparency and autonomy.[It’s scary] how much we’re already monitored, and how much [ad systems] already know about me. [...] [I Would prefer] increasing the amount of diversity within advertisements, without necessarily needing to know for sure if somebody identifies a certain way. (P15)The current user experience of ad platforms leaves little room for direct user input, a power differential noted by our participants.They were highly critical of the inference and categorization done by these systems and the lack of room for self-determination. They Suggested alternatives, including greater transparency about how they were being targeted, the ability to express boundaries or dis-content with certain ad content, and control over which advertisers could bid for their attention. For example, P1 began, “I wish [ads]in general communicated why they’re showing an ad to you” andalso described wanting “autonomy over whether or not I want to disclose a certain part of my identity on my own terms ... rather than just being tracked” (P1).P6 picked up this theme, describing unease with “the sense of being watched, being tracked,” and pointing out the particular pri-vacy needs of many LGBT people that are not publicly out: “If You're not out yet, [you might] be afraid that your mom’s going tobe looking over your shoulder [while you are] scrolling throughInstagram” (P6). Other participants also mentioned concerns about security and privacy online, including P14: “I think in the globalInternet age everyone is very, very concerned about privacy and security. I don’t know what to do about that—and this is again working with the assumption that I must live with [targeted] ads. I Would rather have companies ask me [instead of inferring] ... so I Can just decline” (P14).4.3.3 Queer people imagine the ability to opt out entirely. Partic-ipants’ desire for autonomy frequently stemmed from a wish to escape ad targeting systems altogether. One participant made clear their desire to avoid ad targeting specifically, despite being com-fortable and even interested in other types of ads: “Get rid of [it]... I feel like people around me don’t shop based on seeing what-ever is available in ads. [Instead they] buy things because they become popular, or [when] a curator”—a “real person, influencer or otherwise”—“promotes an item” (P10). When asked what she would change about ads if she could change anything, P11 also said, “I Would probably get rid of it. If you gave me a magic wand that can change anything about online advertising, I wouldn’t have online advertising” (P11).",1713-17,"P5 summarized, “I think there is starting to become change, but I see a lot of ... stereotypically, traditionally beau-tiful [people in ads] who are tall, or thin, or white, or able-bodied,etc.”"
31,Advertisements,reflectsPrecept,LGBTQStereotypes,"We conducted 18 semi-structured interviews over Zoom lasting between 30 and 45 minutes, which were recorded for transcription and analysis. Participants received a written consent form before the interviews and were compensated with a $15 Amazon gift card distributed via email afterward. Participants in this paper are identified by unique anonymous identifiers (P1 - P18) to maintain their privacy. Our study was reviewed and approved by the StanfordUniversity Institutional Review Board.In the interviews, we asked about participants’ experiences with online advertising in three parts: first asking questions about their experiences overall with online ads, second asking them to reflect on ad targeting and its relationship to various aspects of their iden-tities, and third relating to their identity as an LGBTQ+ person. The Complete interview guide is listed in Appendix A. At the close of the interview, we asked participants open-ended demographic ques-tions, having them provide any or all of the following in their own words: age, gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity, and nationality.Part 1: Online advertising. We asked participants which platforms they were most active on, how frequently they encountered ads on those platforms, and what types of advertising they encountered.We also sought to understand how and why participants engaged with ads they considered compelling, asking participants to recall an ad they had recently interacted with and reflect on the charac-teristics, including aspects of the images or text, that drew their attention.Part 2: Ad targeting. Next, to understand participants’ beliefs about what inferences ad platforms may be making and how they believe such inferences are made, we asked them to reflect on the kinds of themes, people, and other imagery they usually see in their targeted ads, and speculate as to why they receive such content. Wealso explored the relationship of this content with multiple aspects of their identities, asking about feelings of mis/representation and whether or not they wanted these identity aspects to be represented and/or inferred by ad targeting systems.Part 3: Targeted ads and LGBTQ+ identity. In our final set of interview questions, we explored participants’ perceptions of pos-itive and negative impacts on LGBTQ+ people and communities.In relation to negative impacts, we asked further questions about participants' knowledge and use of strategies for avoiding ad tar-geting, as well as what they would like to see changed (including more realistic and more speculative ideas). Though extant theoretical frameworks shaped our inquiries in this work, our goal was to let the patterns of our data guide our anal-ysis, so we chose a reflexive approach [11]. Initially, one author conducted line-by-line open coding of all transcripts to develop a codebook of keywords and sub-keywords. Using this codebook,another author took a second pass, coding the transcripts a second time and updating, replacing, or adding additional keywords as needed. The first coding pass was conducted using NVivo qual-itative analysis software, while the second was conducted usingDelve for better collaboration. After collaborative discussions of the coded content, these two authors came to a consensus about the final set of codes and coded content. Examples of codes included: “binary gender norms”, “control/autonomy”, “lacking nuance”, and“feels creepy”.Themes were collaboratively synthesized based on the most prevalent codes, developed narratively, and divided into three major sets of insights pertaining to participants’ views on ad content, ad targeting as it currently exists, and ideals and alternatives they envisioned. We re-referenced the interview transcripts to refine and finalize themes, ensuring they emerged as directly as possible from our data. This study involves data collection with LGBTQ+ individuals, a group that has specific privacy and safety concerns. This is espe-cially true given the range of risks faced by some queer people due to their nationalities (homosexuality is still criminalized in some countries [57]), gender identities (transgender people, especially transfeminine people of color, face a disproportionate risk of vio-lence [22]), and other attributes.

Explaining the impact this has on their self-image, they said, “When I see ads, especially marriage- and pregnancy-related ads that are targeted towards women, it does make [me] feel like, oh no, is this how people[in real life] see me, if this is what my browsing data indicates?”(P2). A cisgender gay male participant also reported receiving ads targeted to women, and that this made him question his identity for a time: “I did struggle a lot with my gender identity for a while because when you’re constantly getting ... ads targeted for a female,I was like, how do I identify? [...] I think it does create a lot of confusion” (P1). This feeling of confusion was also echoed by anon-binary participant who reported that the oscillating gender essentialist extremes in their ads led them to conclude that these systems found their identity “confusing.” They explained, “For some reason I get a lot of ads related to pregnancy or having children.On the other end of the spectrum, I get a lot of ads for jocks straps,which I don’t really understand. But I think [the system is] very confused about what my gender is” (P18).In addition to these direct harms, participants also expressed experiencing more nebulous harm caused by ads acting as a reminder of power and privilege in society at large. As P12 thoughtfully put it, “If [ad targeting] took into account [queer] identities, I would feel like at least I’m recognized in society. But if they do not ... I[am reminded that] I’m left out, that many people do not accept me as who I am” (P12). In addition to understanding participants’ criticisms of ad targeting content and systems, we were interested in hearing their generative perspectives—changes they felt could improve their experiences with targeted ads. Proposed shifts included more diverse ad content,more transparency about the ad targeting process, more autonomy in the use and collection of people’s personal data, and the ability to forgo targeted advertising in its current form entirely.4.3.1 Queer people want more diversity in ad content.It has to be actually really nuanced and critical, it can't just be representation for the sake of making [brands]look better on the surface. (P4)We previously discussed participants’ frustration with the preva-lence of stereotypes in the content that they encountered. A solution many identified was to increase diverse representation in ad con-tent. Participants highlighted the need for more racially diverse depictions of queer people, and for more body diversity in general. P16 voiced a desire to see more “people of all different appearances and sizes and races and presentations. A lot of times people like myself—thin, white, [female-assigned] people ... are the kind of[non-binary] people getting attention in the media.”Even the participants most skeptical of targeted advertising impact on queer communities acknowledged the value that rep-resentation holds for queer people, especially for its role in the identity formation of queer youth:If there were to be more [queer] representation, I also think having [it normalize] our identities—how we look and how we identify, or who we are—having that normalized [for] someone who’s young, maybe younger than 12, [to] see this representation and feel some kind of connection to it. [...] That is monumental,and something I would advocate more for. (P15)Participants did, however, understand visibility as a double-edged sword, with the potential to impact public perceptions ofLGBTQ+ people and communities both positively and negatively—something supported by prior research in television and print ad-vertising [7, 64]. As P16 put it: “You have to watch what’s going on out there, because for some people that aren’t in the LGBT commu-nity their only exposure to queer people might be through these ads, and they might be basing their views off those ads”.Many participants noted that improved diversity should not bedone solely to improve a brand’s rapport with queer consumers.Instead, they expressed a desire for advertisers to include nuancedqueer representation in content with broad reach. To quote P2, “[Iwant] more queer people and queer relationship representation,just in mainstream ads—I feel like a lot of the queer ads I see are just for queer-specific things”. Moreover, they wanted advertisers to back up visual cues with action and not, in the words of P4, “before and try to just get my money.” P16 echoed the same sentiment,drawing on the idea of “rainbow capitalism” [13]: “I think if I go to the website and they were just using [queer imagery] to attract people and not following through—you know, rainbow capitalism—that would further turn me off from the product. But if they had marketing I felt represented in and also supported causes I believed in, I would be more likely to support them, for sure” (P16).4.3.2 Queer people want more transparency and autonomy.[It’s scary] how much we’re already monitored, and how much [ad systems] already know about me. [...] [I Would prefer] increasing the amount of diversity within advertisements, without necessarily needing to know for sure if somebody identifies a certain way. (P15)The current user experience of ad platforms leaves little room for direct user input, a power differential noted by our participants.They were highly critical of the inference and categorization done by these systems and the lack of room for self-determination. They Suggested alternatives, including greater transparency about how they were being targeted, the ability to express boundaries or dis-content with certain ad content, and control over which advertisers could bid for their attention. For example, P1 began, “I wish [ads]in general communicated why they’re showing an ad to you” andalso described wanting “autonomy over whether or not I want to disclose a certain part of my identity on my own terms ... rather than just being tracked” (P1).P6 picked up this theme, describing unease with “the sense of being watched, being tracked,” and pointing out the particular pri-vacy needs of many LGBT people that are not publicly out: “If You're not out yet, [you might] be afraid that your mom’s going tobe looking over your shoulder [while you are] scrolling throughInstagram” (P6). Other participants also mentioned concerns about security and privacy online, including P14: “I think in the globalInternet age everyone is very, very concerned about privacy and security. I don’t know what to do about that—and this is again working with the assumption that I must live with [targeted] ads. I Would rather have companies ask me [instead of inferring] ... so I Can just decline” (P14).4.3.3 Queer people imagine the ability to opt out entirely. Partic-ipants’ desire for autonomy frequently stemmed from a wish to escape ad targeting systems altogether. One participant made clear their desire to avoid ad targeting specifically, despite being com-fortable and even interested in other types of ads: “Get rid of [it]... I feel like people around me don’t shop based on seeing what-ever is available in ads. [Instead they] buy things because they become popular, or [when] a curator”—a “real person, influencer or otherwise”—“promotes an item” (P10). When asked what she would change about ads if she could change anything, P11 also said, “I Would probably get rid of it. If you gave me a magic wand that can change anything about online advertising, I wouldn’t have online advertising” (P11).",1713-17,The overall lack of queer representation was exacerbated by the heavy pres-ence of stereotypes in targeted ads seemingly intended to interestqueer consumers.
32,LackOfDiversityInAdvertising,constrainsAgent,PeopleWithMultipleMarginalizedIdentities,"We conducted 18 semi-structured interviews over Zoom lasting between 30 and 45 minutes, which were recorded for transcription and analysis. Participants received a written consent form before the interviews and were compensated with a $15 Amazon gift card distributed via email afterward. Participants in this paper are identified by unique anonymous identifiers (P1 - P18) to maintain their privacy. Our study was reviewed and approved by the StanfordUniversity Institutional Review Board.In the interviews, we asked about participants’ experiences with online advertising in three parts: first asking questions about their experiences overall with online ads, second asking them to reflect on ad targeting and its relationship to various aspects of their iden-tities, and third relating to their identity as an LGBTQ+ person. The Complete interview guide is listed in Appendix A. At the close of the interview, we asked participants open-ended demographic ques-tions, having them provide any or all of the following in their own words: age, gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity, and nationality.Part 1: Online advertising. We asked participants which platforms they were most active on, how frequently they encountered ads on those platforms, and what types of advertising they encountered.We also sought to understand how and why participants engaged with ads they considered compelling, asking participants to recall an ad they had recently interacted with and reflect on the charac-teristics, including aspects of the images or text, that drew their attention.Part 2: Ad targeting. Next, to understand participants’ beliefs about what inferences ad platforms may be making and how they believe such inferences are made, we asked them to reflect on the kinds of themes, people, and other imagery they usually see in their targeted ads, and speculate as to why they receive such content. Wealso explored the relationship of this content with multiple aspects of their identities, asking about feelings of mis/representation and whether or not they wanted these identity aspects to be represented and/or inferred by ad targeting systems.Part 3: Targeted ads and LGBTQ+ identity. In our final set of interview questions, we explored participants’ perceptions of pos-itive and negative impacts on LGBTQ+ people and communities.In relation to negative impacts, we asked further questions about participants' knowledge and use of strategies for avoiding ad tar-geting, as well as what they would like to see changed (including more realistic and more speculative ideas). Though extant theoretical frameworks shaped our inquiries in this work, our goal was to let the patterns of our data guide our anal-ysis, so we chose a reflexive approach [11]. Initially, one author conducted line-by-line open coding of all transcripts to develop a codebook of keywords and sub-keywords. Using this codebook,another author took a second pass, coding the transcripts a second time and updating, replacing, or adding additional keywords as needed. The first coding pass was conducted using NVivo qual-itative analysis software, while the second was conducted usingDelve for better collaboration. After collaborative discussions of the coded content, these two authors came to a consensus about the final set of codes and coded content. Examples of codes included: “binary gender norms”, “control/autonomy”, “lacking nuance”, and“feels creepy”.Themes were collaboratively synthesized based on the most prevalent codes, developed narratively, and divided into three major sets of insights pertaining to participants’ views on ad content, ad targeting as it currently exists, and ideals and alternatives they envisioned. We re-referenced the interview transcripts to refine and finalize themes, ensuring they emerged as directly as possible from our data. This study involves data collection with LGBTQ+ individuals, a group that has specific privacy and safety concerns. This is espe-cially true given the range of risks faced by some queer people due to their nationalities (homosexuality is still criminalized in some countries [57]), gender identities (transgender people, especially transfeminine people of color, face a disproportionate risk of vio-lence [22]), and other attributes. We, the research team, took care of our recruitment, data collection, and analysis to retain their con-fidentiality, including not requiring participants to provide their legal names, compensating them using gift cards not attached to their legal identities, and ensuring that only the research team had access to the transcripts and recordings. Additionally, we acknowl-edge the tensions and risks inherent to conducting research focused on marginalized communities and individuals [40]. Our resulting analysis is not only shaped by a theoretical grounding in queer and feminist theory, but each author’s individual experiences as a per-son marginalized along the axes of gender, race, sexuality, ethnicity,and other identities (with overlaps and privileges therein). We divide our findings regarding ad content into three main points:the overarching lack of representations of queerness, stereotypical-ity when such identities were seen in ads, and the particular lack of representation faced by those with multiple marginalized identities.4.1.1 Participants’ ads reflect heterosexual societal norms. Although participants did widely report receiving ads targeted to them that depicted queer people, across the board they reported that many or most of the ads they saw were instead reflective of dominant hetero-sexual societal norms. P5 summarized, “I think there is starting to become change, but I see a lot of ... stereotypically, traditionally beau-tiful [people in ads] who are tall, or thin, or white, or able-bodied,etc.” (P5). This was echoed by other participants; P16 described the people they saw as being “generally either thin white men or thin white women. Generally attractive people” (P16). Another, despite seeing some ads geared towards queer people, noted that “most of the ads I see I typically feature straight couples” (P2). This aligns with prior work about ads’ reflections of dominant culture [60].4.1.2 Representations of queerness perpetuate stereotypes. The overall lack of queer representation was exacerbated by the heavy pres-ence of stereotypes in targeted ads seemingly intended to interestqueer consumers. In line with Kates [36]’s assessment that advertis-ing as an activity reflects dominant discourses, P1 described feeling caricatured: “It’s like the stereotype of what a gay man is ... like super dramatized, a point where I’m like, I don’t know anybody who acts like that. [...] I don’t know who’s relating to that; it’s [how]straight people think gay people act” (P1).More specifically, participants mentioned seeing stereotypes relating queerness to promiscuity and substance use. P6 describe some of the ads they saw as “hypersexualized”: “The advertisements are all, like, nightclub lighting, like all of these hot 32-year-old with basically all their clothes off, dancing and making out with each other” (P6). They clarified, “I don’t think that’s bad, it looks like they’re having a great time, but it’s really weird. I’m not sure if I consider it offensive or not.” Another described the ads they saw representing queer people as “pertaining to drinking, like fo rbeers” (P15). Unfortunately, this is nothing new; as prior literature has recorded, and some of our older participants remembered, such stereotypes reflect historical patterns in advertising [60]. P13 (age41) noted, “It used to be [that] alcohol and cigarettes were the only companies [with] gay [representation in] ads, so that felt a little stigmatizing” (P13).Other participants also felt misrepresented by content that, de-spite featuring appropriate representations of queerness, did not align with their own personal queer identities. For instance, a high-femme lesbian participant pointed out that the queer-targeted ads she received made “incorrect assumptions” about her gender presentation: “While I am gay, that does not immediately imply that Iwant to dress androgynously” (P11).4.1.3 Lack of diversity especially impacts those with intersecting identities. The lack of diversity in ad content was especially notice-able for those holding multiple marginalized identities, including participants of color; trans, non-binary, and gender-nonconforming participants; those with disabilities; and fat participants. A majority of participants observed a lack of racial diversity in their targeted ads; both white and non-white participants had their targeted advertisements dominated by depictions of white people. P1, a gay Iraqi man, described his targeted ads as being centered on white Western lifestyles and perspectives, sharing,“Any identities outside of that are super hard to see, or they're super exaggerated” (P1). This was one of the most widely-reported themes; 14 out of 18 participants mentioned the overwhelming whiteness in their ads. Gender-nonconforming participants noted that even when systems accurately determined their gender identities, their targeted ads reflected heteropatriarchy assumptions about their experi-ences. P6, a non-binary lesbian, reflected on the inadequacy of the lesbian representation they saw in ads: “Where there’s a lesbian cou-ple, usually both women are white and very feminine [with] longhair—I don’t really think we’ll ever see that much butch [represen-tation] because of the way our culture constructs what a beautiful woman looks like” (P6). A non-binary participant reported, “I feel like [my ads] are targeted more towards trans men, or someonewho’s more masculine than I am” (P2). Participants also cited a lack of body diversity in the models they saw, in particular a lack of depictions of fatness and disability. Consistent with prior work [23], our participants considered this problematic: “I’m a fat person ... I’m part of a lot of groups for other fat people. I think a lot of ads show me weight loss [content]because they assume that ... I want to lose weight, so that’s one thing they get wrong” (P3). Another participant reported that their ads overlook “disability or chronic illness—I have some chronic illnesses and friends who do as well, and it can be hard to see ads that don’t represent your queer friend group” (P5). Aside from their concerns about ad content, all participants reflected some degree of awareness and discomfort with ad target-ing systems identifying them as queer, a type of inference they were easily able to identify: “[Unlike ads for straight people,] you can really tell the ad targeting is for queer people; [advertisers]make it so obvious” (P18). Their responses to these inference- and categorization-based systems’ treatment ranged from mild discom-fort to experiences of significant emotional harm.4.2.1 Ad targeting made participants feel unsettled and unsafe.While participants expressed frustration with targeted advertis-ing that missed the mark, they shared that that accurate targeting often felt “creepy” (P8), “disconcerting” (P13), and even “scary” (P3).Creepiness, in particular, was a recurring theme. P3 reported feeling torn between the desire for convenience and this creepiness: “I get kind of creeped out when [ad systems] seem like they know a lot of things about my life and my interests. [...] From convenience sake,I’ll be more likely to see things that I’d be interested in ... but then,on the other hand, I don’t like advertisements and how all these places are collecting personal data about me” (P3).Taking the same perspective from the opposite direction, P4described that misrepresentative content sometimes felt reassur-ing, in that the ad targeting system “doesn’t really know me” (P4).Feeling “seen” by targeted ad systems frequently felt as much like surveillance as inclusion. In the United Sates, where most majora's platforms are based, legal protection of queer identities is based on the right to privacy [30]; it is unsurprising, then, that queerpeople’s privacy concerns are highly specific, and connected to their larger concerns about their civil rights. P11, a lesbian transwoman who expressed a desire for ads more relevant to her transidentity, expressed simultaneous concern: “I just don’t love the idea that the internet sees me for me, because that’s kind of danger-ous sometimes. There are state legislatures and whole countries that have passed laws to try to make it difficult, if not straight-up impossible, for me to live” (P11).4.2.2 Participants made sense of ad targeting and its failures. Partic-ipants had many plausible hypotheses for the mechanisms behind their targeted ads, including their own behaviors (P18: “I like to do creative writing so I go to baby name websites to look for names for characters, and ... the ads might be thinking, oh this person is pregnant because they’re looking up baby names”), and advertisers lacking nuanced understandings of queerness (P1, a gay middle eastern man, described many of his ads as “completely alienating to other members of the community [besides white gay men]”).Another common explanation participants pointed to was the advertising industry itself. P14 described white-centric ad content as being reflective of “the nature of the advertising business”, as well as broader social norms: “A lot of the ads showcase white gay male models—cisgender, white models—which, I mean, that’s obviously problematic, but it’s also a reflection of kind of the hegemonic discourse that is almost always in queer spaces, right? Unless you’rein a particularly non-white space.” (P14)4.2.3 Corporate tokenization of queerness contributes to skepticism. I don’t want them to market toward me—like, I don't think that companies can have a genuine care about communities that I’m part of, so I’d rather they [not] before and try to just get my money. (P4)Many participants were attuned to the financial incentives for brands targeting queer customers. They found this motive oppor-tunistic and profit-seeking, describing it as undermining the value of representation: “They’re all trying to get me to buy things, that’swhat their end goal is, because capitalism. So I feel like that’s a root of problematic advertising, is that they don’t really care about the impact, they just want you to buy” (P3). In the context of trans-gender representation, P18 expressed that increased inclusion feltshallow and performative: “[Many organizations are] jumping on the bandwagon, and when it actually comes down to support trans rights, they’re not there” (P18). Several participants reported that this kind of opportunistic rep-resentation, which they described as tokenizing, insincere, or pink-washing, was especially common during Pride Month, even from brands and organizations that otherwise did not otherwise make an effort to include queer customers among their customer base: “During Pride Month in New York, where there were a lot of ads Ifelt didn’t really target me correctly—they were just like, here’s the corporation, we put a rainbow logo on it” (P5).4.2.4 Queer people suffer emotional harms due to ad targeting.I think it’s the ads that are creating unrealistic image of our community and of ourselves. (P8)As described in 4.1, participants found themselves targeted with some content that was obviously damaging, including ads for al-cohol (given that members of the LGBTQ+ community are dispro-portionately likely to suffer from substance abuse issues [50]), and those for weight loss (P3: “I would say, yeah, probably more so when I was younger than now, but still I would say [weight loss ads] probably do impact my body image issues”).Participants, especially (but not exclusively) those identifying as trans and non-binary, frequently reported feeling misgendered by their targeted ads. Misgendering—when the gendered elements of language used or the underlying inferences made about someone are incongruent with an individual’s gender identity—is a form of harm commonly experienced by transgender people, though it can occur to others as well [42]. One non-binary participant (who doesn't identify as a woman) described feeling misgendered by their ads:“I feel the misrepresentation the most when it has to do with babies,and I feel like those ads are always very gendered, very targeted towards women and society’s idea of [what] a mother or a womanist. [Those] ads make me feel very weird” (P2). Explaining the impact this has on their self-image, they said, “When I see ads, especially marriage- and pregnancy-related ads that are targeted towards women, it does make [me] feel like, oh no, is this how people[in real life] see me, if this is what my browsing data indicates?”(P2). A cisgender gay male participant also reported receiving ads targeted to women, and that this made him question his identity for a time: “I did struggle a lot with my gender identity for a while because when you’re constantly getting ... ads targeted for a female,I was like, how do I identify? [...] I think it does create a lot of confusion” (P1). This feeling of confusion was also echoed by anon-binary participant who reported that the oscillating gender essentialist extremes in their ads led them to conclude that these systems found their identity “confusing.” They explained, “For some reason I get a lot of ads related to pregnancy or having children.On the other end of the spectrum, I get a lot of ads for jocks straps,which I don’t really understand. But I think [the system is] very confused about what my gender is” (P18).In addition to these direct harms, participants also expressed experiencing more nebulous harm caused by ads acting as a reminder of power and privilege in society at large. As P12 thoughtfully put it, “If [ad targeting] took into account [queer] identities, I would feel like at least I’m recognized in society. But if they do not ... I[am reminded that] I’m left out, that many people do not accept me as who I am” (P12). In addition to understanding participants’ criticisms of ad targeting content and systems, we were interested in hearing their generative perspectives—changes they felt could improve their experiences with targeted ads.

We divide our findings regarding ad content into three main points:the overarching lack of representations of queerness, stereotypical-ity when such identities were seen in ads, and the particular lack of representation faced by those with multiple marginalized identities.4.1.1 Participants’ ads reflect heterosexual societal norms. Although participants did widely report receiving ads targeted to them that depicted queer people, across the board they reported that many or most of the ads they saw were instead reflective of dominant hetero-sexual societal norms. P5 summarized, “I think there is starting to become change, but I see a lot of ... stereotypically, traditionally beau-tiful [people in ads] who are tall, or thin, or white, or able-bodied,etc.” (P5). This was echoed by other participants; P16 described the people they saw as being “generally either thin white men or thin white women. Generally attractive people” (P16). Another, despite seeing some ads geared towards queer people, noted that “most of the ads I see I typically feature straight couples” (P2). This aligns with prior work about ads’ reflections of dominant culture [60].4.1.2 Representations of queerness perpetuate stereotypes. The overall lack of queer representation was exacerbated by the heavy pres-ence of stereotypes in targeted ads seemingly intended to interestqueer consumers. In line with Kates [36]’s assessment that advertis-ing as an activity reflects dominant discourses, P1 described feeling caricatured: “It’s like the stereotype of what a gay man is ... like super dramatized, a point where I’m like, I don’t know anybody who acts like that. [...] I don’t know who’s relating to that; it’s [how]straight people think gay people act” (P1).More specifically, participants mentioned seeing stereotypes relating queerness to promiscuity and substance use. P6 describe some of the ads they saw as “hypersexualized”: “The advertisements are all, like, nightclub lighting, like all of these hot 32-year-old with basically all their clothes off, dancing and making out with each other” (P6). They clarified, “I don’t think that’s bad, it looks like they’re having a great time, but it’s really weird. I’m not sure if I consider it offensive or not.” Another described the ads they saw representing queer people as “pertaining to drinking, like fo rbeers” (P15). Unfortunately, this is nothing new; as prior literature has recorded, and some of our older participants remembered, such stereotypes reflect historical patterns in advertising [60]. P13 (age41) noted, “It used to be [that] alcohol and cigarettes were the only companies [with] gay [representation in] ads, so that felt a little stigmatizing” (P13).Other participants also felt misrepresented by content that, de-spite featuring appropriate representations of queerness, did not align with their own personal queer identities. For instance, a high-femme lesbian participant pointed out that the queer-targeted ads she received made “incorrect assumptions” about her gender presentation: “While I am gay, that does not immediately imply that Iwant to dress androgynously” (P11).4.1.3 Lack of diversity especially impacts those with intersecting identities. The lack of diversity in ad content was especially notice-able for those holding multiple marginalized identities, including participants of color; trans, non-binary, and gender-nonconforming participants; those with disabilities; and fat participants. A majority of participants observed a lack of racial diversity in their targeted ads; both white and non-white participants had their targeted advertisements dominated by depictions of white people. P1, a gay Iraqi man, described his targeted ads as being centered on white Western lifestyles and perspectives, sharing,“Any identities outside of that are super hard to see, or they're super exaggerated” (P1). This was one of the most widely-reported themes; 14 out of 18 participants mentioned the overwhelming whiteness in their ads. Gender-nonconforming participants noted that even when systems accurately determined their gender identities, their targeted ads reflected heteropatriarchy assumptions about their experi-ences. P6, a non-binary lesbian, reflected on the inadequacy of the lesbian representation they saw in ads: “Where there’s a lesbian cou-ple, usually both women are white and very feminine [with] longhair—I don’t really think we’ll ever see that much butch [represen-tation] because of the way our culture constructs what a beautiful woman looks like” (P6). A non-binary participant reported, “I feel like [my ads] are targeted more towards trans men, or someonewho’s more masculine than I am” (P2). Participants also cited a lack of body diversity in the models they saw, in particular a lack of depictions of fatness and disability. Consistent with prior work [23], our participants considered this problematic: “I’m a fat person ... I’m part of a lot of groups for other fat people. I think a lot of ads show me weight loss [content]because they assume that ... I want to lose weight, so that’s one thing they get wrong” (P3). Another participant reported that their ads overlook “disability or chronic illness—I have some chronic illnesses and friends who do as well, and it can be hard to see ads that don’t represent your queer friend group” (P5). Aside from their concerns about ad content, all participants reflected some degree of awareness and discomfort with ad target-ing systems identifying them as queer, a type of inference they were easily able to identify: “[Unlike ads for straight people,] you can really tell the ad targeting is for queer people; [advertisers]make it so obvious” (P18). Their responses to these inference- and categorization-based systems’ treatment ranged from mild discom-fort to experiences of significant emotional harm.4.2.1 Ad targeting made participants feel unsettled and unsafe.While participants expressed frustration with targeted advertis-ing that missed the mark, they shared that that accurate targeting often felt “creepy” (P8), “disconcerting” (P13), and even “scary” (P3).Creepiness, in particular, was a recurring theme. P3 reported feeling torn between the desire for convenience and this creepiness: “I get kind of creeped out when [ad systems] seem like they know a lot of things about my life and my interests. [...] From convenience sake,I’ll be more likely to see things that I’d be interested in ... but then,on the other hand, I don’t like advertisements and how all these places are collecting personal data about me” (P3).Taking the same perspective from the opposite direction, P4described that misrepresentative content sometimes felt reassur-ing, in that the ad targeting system “doesn’t really know me” (P4).Feeling “seen” by targeted ad systems frequently felt as much like surveillance as inclusion. In the United Sates, where most majora's platforms are based, legal protection of queer identities is based on the right to privacy [30]; it is unsurprising, then, that queerpeople’s privacy concerns are highly specific, and connected to their larger concerns about their civil rights. P11, a lesbian transwoman who expressed a desire for ads more relevant to her transidentity, expressed simultaneous concern: “I just don’t love the idea that the internet sees me for me, because that’s kind of danger-ous sometimes. There are state legislatures and whole countries that have passed laws to try to make it difficult, if not straight-up impossible, for me to live” (P11).4.2.2 Participants made sense of ad targeting and its failures. Partic-ipants had many plausible hypotheses for the mechanisms behind their targeted ads, including their own behaviors (P18: “I like to do creative writing so I go to baby name websites to look for names for characters, and ... the ads might be thinking, oh this person is pregnant because they’re looking up baby names”), and advertisers lacking nuanced understandings of queerness (P1, a gay middle eastern man, described many of his ads as “completely alienating to other members of the community [besides white gay men]”).Another common explanation participants pointed to was the advertising industry itself. P14 described white-centric ad content as being reflective of “the nature of the advertising business”, as well as broader social norms: “A lot of the ads showcase white gay male models—cisgender, white models—which, I mean, that’s obviously problematic, but it’s also a reflection of kind of the hegemonic discourse that is almost always in queer spaces, right? Unless you’rein a particularly non-white space.” (P14)4.2.3 Corporate tokenization of queerness contributes to skepticism. I don’t want them to market toward me—like, I don't think that companies can have a genuine care about communities that I’m part of, so I’d rather they [not] before and try to just get my money. (P4)Many participants were attuned to the financial incentives for brands targeting queer customers. They found this motive oppor-tunistic and profit-seeking, describing it as undermining the value of representation: “They’re all trying to get me to buy things, that’swhat their end goal is, because capitalism. So I feel like that’s a root of problematic advertising, is that they don’t really care about the impact, they just want you to buy” (P3). In the context of trans-gender representation, P18 expressed that increased inclusion feltshallow and performative: “[Many organizations are] jumping on the bandwagon, and when it actually comes down to support trans rights, they’re not there” (P18). Several participants reported that this kind of opportunistic rep-resentation, which they described as tokenizing, insincere, or pink-washing, was especially common during Pride Month, even from brands and organizations that otherwise did not otherwise make an effort to include queer customers among their customer base: “During Pride Month in New York, where there were a lot of ads Ifelt didn’t really target me correctly—they were just like, here’s the corporation, we put a rainbow logo on it” (P5).4.2.4 Queer people suffer emotional harms due to ad targeting.I think it’s the ads that are creating unrealistic image of our community and of ourselves. (P8)As described in 4.1, participants found themselves targeted with some content that was obviously damaging, including ads for al-cohol (given that members of the LGBTQ+ community are dispro-portionately likely to suffer from substance abuse issues [50]), and those for weight loss (P3: “I would say, yeah, probably more so when I was younger than now, but still I would say [weight loss ads] probably do impact my body image issues”).Participants, especially (but not exclusively) those identifying as trans and non-binary, frequently reported feeling misgendered by their targeted ads. Misgendering—when the gendered elements of language used or the underlying inferences made about someone are incongruent with an individual’s gender identity—is a form of harm commonly experienced by transgender people, though it can occur to others as well [42]. One non-binary participant (who doesn't identify as a woman) described feeling misgendered by their ads:“I feel the misrepresentation the most when it has to do with babies,and I feel like those ads are always very gendered, very targeted towards women and society’s idea of [what] a mother or a womanist. [Those] ads make me feel very weird” (P2). Explaining the impact this has on their self-image, they said, “When I see ads, especially marriage- and pregnancy-related ads that are targeted towards women, it does make [me] feel like, oh no, is this how people[in real life] see me, if this is what my browsing data indicates?”(P2). A cisgender gay male participant also reported receiving ads targeted to women, and that this made him question his identity for a time: “I did struggle a lot with my gender identity for a while because when you’re constantly getting ... ads targeted for a female,I was like, how do I identify? [...] I think it does create a lot of confusion” (P1). This feeling of confusion was also echoed by anon-binary participant who reported that the oscillating gender essentialist extremes in their ads led them to conclude that these systems found their identity “confusing.” They explained, “For some reason I get a lot of ads related to pregnancy or having children.On the other end of the spectrum, I get a lot of ads for jocks straps,which I don’t really understand. But I think [the system is] very confused about what my gender is” (P18).In addition to these direct harms, participants also expressed experiencing more nebulous harm caused by ads acting as a reminder of power and privilege in society at large. As P12 thoughtfully put it, “If [ad targeting] took into account [queer] identities, I would feel like at least I’m recognized in society. But if they do not ... I[am reminded that] I’m left out, that many people do not accept me as who I am” (P12). In addition to understanding participants’ criticisms of ad targeting content and systems, we were interested in hearing their generative perspectives—changes they felt could improve their experiences with targeted ads. Proposed shifts included more diverse ad content,more transparency about the ad targeting process, more autonomy in the use and collection of people’s personal data, and the ability to forgo targeted advertising in its current form entirely.4.3.1 Queer people want more diversity in ad content.It has to be actually really nuanced and critical, it can't just be representation for the sake of making [brands]look better on the surface. (P4)We previously discussed participants’ frustration with the preva-lence of stereotypes in the content that they encountered. A solution many identified was to increase diverse representation in ad con-tent. Participants highlighted the need for more racially diverse depictions of queer people, and for more body diversity in general. P16 voiced a desire to see more “people of all different appearances and sizes and races and presentations. A lot of times people like myself—thin, white, [female-assigned] people ... are the kind of[non-binary] people getting attention in the media.”Even the participants most skeptical of targeted advertising impact on queer communities acknowledged the value that rep-resentation holds for queer people, especially for its role in the identity formation of queer youth:If there were to be more [queer] representation, I also think having [it normalize] our identities—how we look and how we identify, or who we are—having that normalized [for] someone who’s young, maybe younger than 12, [to] see this representation and feel some kind of connection to it. [...] That is monumental,and something I would advocate more for. (P15)Participants did, however, understand visibility as a double-edged sword, with the potential to impact public perceptions ofLGBTQ+ people and communities both positively and negatively—something supported by prior research in television and print ad-vertising [7, 64]. As P16 put it: “You have to watch what’s going on out there, because for some people that aren’t in the LGBT commu-nity their only exposure to queer people might be through these ads, and they might be basing their views off those ads”.Many participants noted that improved diversity should not bedone solely to improve a brand’s rapport with queer consumers.Instead, they expressed a desire for advertisers to include nuancedqueer representation in content with broad reach. To quote P2, “[Iwant] more queer people and queer relationship representation,just in mainstream ads—I feel like a lot of the queer ads I see are just for queer-specific things”. Moreover, they wanted advertisers to back up visual cues with action and not, in the words of P4, “before and try to just get my money.” P16 echoed the same sentiment,drawing on the idea of “rainbow capitalism” [13]: “I think if I go to the website and they were just using [queer imagery] to attract people and not following through—you know, rainbow capitalism—that would further turn me off from the product. But if they had marketing I felt represented in and also supported causes I believed in, I would be more likely to support them, for sure” (P16).4.3.2 Queer people want more transparency and autonomy.[It’s scary] how much we’re already monitored, and how much [ad systems] already know about me. [...] [I Would prefer] increasing the amount of diversity within advertisements, without necessarily needing to know for sure if somebody identifies a certain way. (P15)The current user experience of ad platforms leaves little room for direct user input, a power differential noted by our participants.They were highly critical of the inference and categorization done by these systems and the lack of room for self-determination. They Suggested alternatives, including greater transparency about how they were being targeted, the ability to express boundaries or dis-content with certain ad content, and control over which advertisers could bid for their attention. For example, P1 began, “I wish [ads]in general communicated why they’re showing an ad to you” andalso described wanting “autonomy over whether or not I want to disclose a certain part of my identity on my own terms ... rather than just being tracked” (P1).P6 picked up this theme, describing unease with “the sense of being watched, being tracked,” and pointing out the particular pri-vacy needs of many LGBT people that are not publicly out: “If You're not out yet, [you might] be afraid that your mom’s going tobe looking over your shoulder [while you are] scrolling throughInstagram” (P6). Other participants also mentioned concerns about security and privacy online, including P14: “I think in the globalInternet age everyone is very, very concerned about privacy and security. I don’t know what to do about that—and this is again working with the assumption that I must live with [targeted] ads. I Would rather have companies ask me [instead of inferring] ... so I Can just decline” (P14).4.3.3 Queer people imagine the ability to opt out entirely. Partic-ipants’ desire for autonomy frequently stemmed from a wish to escape ad targeting systems altogether. One participant made clear their desire to avoid ad targeting specifically, despite being com-fortable and even interested in other types of ads: “Get rid of [it]... I feel like people around me don’t shop based on seeing what-ever is available in ads. [Instead they] buy things because they become popular, or [when] a curator”—a “real person, influencer or otherwise”—“promotes an item” (P10). When asked what she would change about ads if she could change anything, P11 also said, “I Would probably get rid of it. If you gave me a magic wand that can change anything about online advertising, I wouldn’t have online advertising” (P11).",1713-17,"the inadequacy of the lesbian representation they saw in ads: “Where there’s a lesbian cou-ple, usually both women are white and very feminine [with] longhair—I don’t really think we’ll ever see that much butch [represen-tation] because of the way our culture constructs what a beautiful woman looks like”"
34,Advertisements,reflectsPrecept,LackOfFatRepresentation,"We conducted 18 semi-structured interviews over Zoom lasting between 30 and 45 minutes, which were recorded for transcription and analysis. Participants received a written consent form before the interviews and were compensated with a $15 Amazon gift card distributed via email afterward. Participants in this paper are identified by unique anonymous identifiers (P1 - P18) to maintain their privacy. Our study was reviewed and approved by the StanfordUniversity Institutional Review Board.In the interviews, we asked about participants’ experiences with online advertising in three parts: first asking questions about their experiences overall with online ads, second asking them to reflect on ad targeting and its relationship to various aspects of their iden-tities, and third relating to their identity as an LGBTQ+ person. The Complete interview guide is listed in Appendix A. At the close of the interview, we asked participants open-ended demographic ques-tions, having them provide any or all of the following in their own words: age, gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity, and nationality.Part 1: Online advertising. We asked participants which platforms they were most active on, how frequently they encountered ads on those platforms, and what types of advertising they encountered.We also sought to understand how and why participants engaged with ads they considered compelling, asking participants to recall an ad they had recently interacted with and reflect on the charac-teristics, including aspects of the images or text, that drew their attention.Part 2: Ad targeting. Next, to understand participants’ beliefs about what inferences ad platforms may be making and how they believe such inferences are made, we asked them to reflect on the kinds of themes, people, and other imagery they usually see in their targeted ads, and speculate as to why they receive such content. Wealso explored the relationship of this content with multiple aspects of their identities, asking about feelings of mis/representation and whether or not they wanted these identity aspects to be represented and/or inferred by ad targeting systems.Part 3: Targeted ads and LGBTQ+ identity. In our final set of interview questions, we explored participants’ perceptions of pos-itive and negative impacts on LGBTQ+ people and communities.In relation to negative impacts, we asked further questions about participants' knowledge and use of strategies for avoiding ad tar-geting, as well as what they would like to see changed (including more realistic and more speculative ideas). Though extant theoretical frameworks shaped our inquiries in this work, our goal was to let the patterns of our data guide our anal-ysis, so we chose a reflexive approach [11]. Initially, one author conducted line-by-line open coding of all transcripts to develop a codebook of keywords and sub-keywords. Using this codebook,another author took a second pass, coding the transcripts a second time and updating, replacing, or adding additional keywords as needed. The first coding pass was conducted using NVivo qual-itative analysis software, while the second was conducted usingDelve for better collaboration. After collaborative discussions of the coded content, these two authors came to a consensus about the final set of codes and coded content. Examples of codes included: “binary gender norms”, “control/autonomy”, “lacking nuance”, and“feels creepy”.Themes were collaboratively synthesized based on the most prevalent codes, developed narratively, and divided into three major sets of insights pertaining to participants’ views on ad content, ad targeting as it currently exists, and ideals and alternatives they envisioned. We re-referenced the interview transcripts to refine and finalize themes, ensuring they emerged as directly as possible from our data. This study involves data collection with LGBTQ+ individuals, a group that has specific privacy and safety concerns. This is espe-cially true given the range of risks faced by some queer people due to their nationalities (homosexuality is still criminalized in some countries [57]), gender identities (transgender people, especially transfeminine people of color, face a disproportionate risk of vio-lence [22]), and other attributes. We, the research team, took care of our recruitment, data collection, and analysis to retain their con-fidentiality, including not requiring participants to provide their legal names, compensating them using gift cards not attached to their legal identities, and ensuring that only the research team had access to the transcripts and recordings. Additionally, we acknowl-edge the tensions and risks inherent to conducting research focused on marginalized communities and individuals [40]. Our resulting analysis is not only shaped by a theoretical grounding in queer and feminist theory, but each author’s individual experiences as a per-son marginalized along the axes of gender, race, sexuality, ethnicity,and other identities (with overlaps and privileges therein).

This feeling of confusion was also echoed by anon-binary participant who reported that the oscillating gender essentialist extremes in their ads led them to conclude that these systems found their identity “confusing.” They explained, “For some reason I get a lot of ads related to pregnancy or having children.On the other end of the spectrum, I get a lot of ads for jocks straps,which I don’t really understand. But I think [the system is] very confused about what my gender is” (P18).In addition to these direct harms, participants also expressed experiencing more nebulous harm caused by ads acting as a reminder of power and privilege in society at large. As P12 thoughtfully put it, “If [ad targeting] took into account [queer] identities, I would feel like at least I’m recognized in society. But if they do not ... I[am reminded that] I’m left out, that many people do not accept me as who I am” (P12). In addition to understanding participants’ criticisms of ad targeting content and systems, we were interested in hearing their generative perspectives—changes they felt could improve their experiences with targeted ads. Proposed shifts included more diverse ad content,more transparency about the ad targeting process, more autonomy in the use and collection of people’s personal data, and the ability to forgo targeted advertising in its current form entirely.4.3.1 Queer people want more diversity in ad content.It has to be actually really nuanced and critical, it can't just be representation for the sake of making [brands]look better on the surface. (P4)We previously discussed participants’ frustration with the preva-lence of stereotypes in the content that they encountered. A solution many identified was to increase diverse representation in ad con-tent. Participants highlighted the need for more racially diverse depictions of queer people, and for more body diversity in general. P16 voiced a desire to see more “people of all different appearances and sizes and races and presentations. A lot of times people like myself—thin, white, [female-assigned] people ... are the kind of[non-binary] people getting attention in the media.”Even the participants most skeptical of targeted advertising impact on queer communities acknowledged the value that rep-resentation holds for queer people, especially for its role in the identity formation of queer youth:If there were to be more [queer] representation, I also think having [it normalize] our identities—how we look and how we identify, or who we are—having that normalized [for] someone who’s young, maybe younger than 12, [to] see this representation and feel some kind of connection to it. [...] That is monumental,and something I would advocate more for. (P15)Participants did, however, understand visibility as a double-edged sword, with the potential to impact public perceptions ofLGBTQ+ people and communities both positively and negatively—something supported by prior research in television and print ad-vertising [7, 64]. As P16 put it: “You have to watch what’s going on out there, because for some people that aren’t in the LGBT commu-nity their only exposure to queer people might be through these ads, and they might be basing their views off those ads”.Many participants noted that improved diversity should not bedone solely to improve a brand’s rapport with queer consumers.Instead, they expressed a desire for advertisers to include nuancedqueer representation in content with broad reach. To quote P2, “[Iwant] more queer people and queer relationship representation,just in mainstream ads—I feel like a lot of the queer ads I see are just for queer-specific things”. Moreover, they wanted advertisers to back up visual cues with action and not, in the words of P4, “before and try to just get my money.” P16 echoed the same sentiment,drawing on the idea of “rainbow capitalism” [13]: “I think if I go to the website and they were just using [queer imagery] to attract people and not following through—you know, rainbow capitalism—that would further turn me off from the product. But if they had marketing I felt represented in and also supported causes I believed in, I would be more likely to support them, for sure” (P16).4.3.2 Queer people want more transparency and autonomy.[It’s scary] how much we’re already monitored, and how much [ad systems] already know about me. [...] [I Would prefer] increasing the amount of diversity within advertisements, without necessarily needing to know for sure if somebody identifies a certain way. (P15)The current user experience of ad platforms leaves little room for direct user input, a power differential noted by our participants.They were highly critical of the inference and categorization done by these systems and the lack of room for self-determination. They Suggested alternatives, including greater transparency about how they were being targeted, the ability to express boundaries or dis-content with certain ad content, and control over which advertisers could bid for their attention. For example, P1 began, “I wish [ads]in general communicated why they’re showing an ad to you” andalso described wanting “autonomy over whether or not I want to disclose a certain part of my identity on my own terms ... rather than just being tracked” (P1).P6 picked up this theme, describing unease with “the sense of being watched, being tracked,” and pointing out the particular pri-vacy needs of many LGBT people that are not publicly out: “If You're not out yet, [you might] be afraid that your mom’s going tobe looking over your shoulder [while you are] scrolling throughInstagram” (P6). Other participants also mentioned concerns about security and privacy online, including P14: “I think in the globalInternet age everyone is very, very concerned about privacy and security. I don’t know what to do about that—and this is again working with the assumption that I must live with [targeted] ads. I Would rather have companies ask me [instead of inferring] ... so I Can just decline” (P14).4.3.3 Queer people imagine the ability to opt out entirely. Partic-ipants’ desire for autonomy frequently stemmed from a wish to escape ad targeting systems altogether. One participant made clear their desire to avoid ad targeting specifically, despite being com-fortable and even interested in other types of ads: “Get rid of [it]... I feel like people around me don’t shop based on seeing what-ever is available in ads. [Instead they] buy things because they become popular, or [when] a curator”—a “real person, influencer or otherwise”—“promotes an item” (P10). When asked what she would change about ads if she could change anything, P11 also said, “I Would probably get rid of it. If you gave me a magic wand that can change anything about online advertising, I wouldn’t have online advertising” (P11).",1713-17,"Participants also cited a lack of body diversity in the models they saw, in particular a lack of depictions of fatness"
35,Advertisements,reflectsPrecept,LackOfDisabledRepresentation,"We conducted 18 semi-structured interviews over Zoom lasting between 30 and 45 minutes, which were recorded for transcription and analysis. Participants received a written consent form before the interviews and were compensated with a $15 Amazon gift card distributed via email afterward. Participants in this paper are identified by unique anonymous identifiers (P1 - P18) to maintain their privacy. Our study was reviewed and approved by the StanfordUniversity Institutional Review Board.In the interviews, we asked about participants’ experiences with online advertising in three parts: first asking questions about their experiences overall with online ads, second asking them to reflect on ad targeting and its relationship to various aspects of their iden-tities, and third relating to their identity as an LGBTQ+ person. The Complete interview guide is listed in Appendix A. At the close of the interview, we asked participants open-ended demographic ques-tions, having them provide any or all of the following in their own words: age, gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity, and nationality.Part 1: Online advertising. We asked participants which platforms they were most active on, how frequently they encountered ads on those platforms, and what types of advertising they encountered.We also sought to understand how and why participants engaged with ads they considered compelling, asking participants to recall an ad they had recently interacted with and reflect on the charac-teristics, including aspects of the images or text, that drew their attention.Part 2: Ad targeting. Next, to understand participants’ beliefs about what inferences ad platforms may be making and how they believe such inferences are made, we asked them to reflect on the kinds of themes, people, and other imagery they usually see in their targeted ads, and speculate as to why they receive such content. Wealso explored the relationship of this content with multiple aspects of their identities, asking about feelings of mis/representation and whether or not they wanted these identity aspects to be represented and/or inferred by ad targeting systems.Part 3: Targeted ads and LGBTQ+ identity. In our final set of interview questions, we explored participants’ perceptions of pos-itive and negative impacts on LGBTQ+ people and communities.In relation to negative impacts, we asked further questions about participants' knowledge and use of strategies for avoiding ad tar-geting, as well as what they would like to see changed (including more realistic and more speculative ideas). Though extant theoretical frameworks shaped our inquiries in this work, our goal was to let the patterns of our data guide our anal-ysis, so we chose a reflexive approach [11]. Initially, one author conducted line-by-line open coding of all transcripts to develop a codebook of keywords and sub-keywords. Using this codebook,another author took a second pass, coding the transcripts a second time and updating, replacing, or adding additional keywords as needed. The first coding pass was conducted using NVivo qual-itative analysis software, while the second was conducted usingDelve for better collaboration. After collaborative discussions of the coded content, these two authors came to a consensus about the final set of codes and coded content. Examples of codes included: “binary gender norms”, “control/autonomy”, “lacking nuance”, and“feels creepy”.Themes were collaboratively synthesized based on the most prevalent codes, developed narratively, and divided into three major sets of insights pertaining to participants’ views on ad content, ad targeting as it currently exists, and ideals and alternatives they envisioned. We re-referenced the interview transcripts to refine and finalize themes, ensuring they emerged as directly as possible from our data. This study involves data collection with LGBTQ+ individuals, a group that has specific privacy and safety concerns. This is espe-cially true given the range of risks faced by some queer people due to their nationalities (homosexuality is still criminalized in some countries [57]), gender identities (transgender people, especially transfeminine people of color, face a disproportionate risk of vio-lence [22]), and other attributes. We, the research team, took care of our recruitment, data collection, and analysis to retain their con-fidentiality, including not requiring participants to provide their legal names, compensating them using gift cards not attached to their legal identities, and ensuring that only the research team had access to the transcripts and recordings. Additionally, we acknowl-edge the tensions and risks inherent to conducting research focused on marginalized communities and individuals [40]. Our resulting analysis is not only shaped by a theoretical grounding in queer and feminist theory, but each author’s individual experiences as a per-son marginalized along the axes of gender, race, sexuality, ethnicity,and other identities (with overlaps and privileges therein). We divide our findings regarding ad content into three main points:the overarching lack of representations of queerness, stereotypical-ity when such identities were seen in ads, and the particular lack of representation faced by those with multiple marginalized identities.4.1.1 Participants’ ads reflect heterosexual societal norms. Although participants did widely report receiving ads targeted to them that depicted queer people, across the board they reported that many or most of the ads they saw were instead reflective of dominant hetero-sexual societal norms. P5 summarized, “I think there is starting to become change, but I see a lot of ... stereotypically, traditionally beau-tiful [people in ads] who are tall, or thin, or white, or able-bodied,etc.” (P5). This was echoed by other participants; P16 described the people they saw as being “generally either thin white men or thin white women. Generally attractive people” (P16). Another, despite seeing some ads geared towards queer people, noted that “most of the ads I see I typically feature straight couples” (P2). This aligns with prior work about ads’ reflections of dominant culture [60].4.1.2 Representations of queerness perpetuate stereotypes. The overall lack of queer representation was exacerbated by the heavy pres-ence of stereotypes in targeted ads seemingly intended to interestqueer consumers. In line with Kates [36]’s assessment that advertis-ing as an activity reflects dominant discourses, P1 described feeling caricatured: “It’s like the stereotype of what a gay man is ... like super dramatized, a point where I’m like, I don’t know anybody who acts like that. [...] I don’t know who’s relating to that; it’s [how]straight people think gay people act” (P1).More specifically, participants mentioned seeing stereotypes relating queerness to promiscuity and substance use. P6 describe some of the ads they saw as “hypersexualized”: “The advertisements are all, like, nightclub lighting, like all of these hot 32-year-old with basically all their clothes off, dancing and making out with each other” (P6). They clarified, “I don’t think that’s bad, it looks like they’re having a great time, but it’s really weird. I’m not sure if I consider it offensive or not.” Another described the ads they saw representing queer people as “pertaining to drinking, like fo rbeers” (P15). Unfortunately, this is nothing new; as prior literature has recorded, and some of our older participants remembered, such stereotypes reflect historical patterns in advertising [60]. P13 (age41) noted, “It used to be [that] alcohol and cigarettes were the only companies [with] gay [representation in] ads, so that felt a little stigmatizing” (P13).Other participants also felt misrepresented by content that, de-spite featuring appropriate representations of queerness, did not align with their own personal queer identities. For instance, a high-femme lesbian participant pointed out that the queer-targeted ads she received made “incorrect assumptions” about her gender presentation: “While I am gay, that does not immediately imply that Iwant to dress androgynously” (P11).4.1.3 Lack of diversity especially impacts those with intersecting identities. The lack of diversity in ad content was especially notice-able for those holding multiple marginalized identities, including participants of color; trans, non-binary, and gender-nonconforming participants; those with disabilities; and fat participants. A majority of participants observed a lack of racial diversity in their targeted ads; both white and non-white participants had their targeted advertisements dominated by depictions of white people. P1, a gay Iraqi man, described his targeted ads as being centered on white Western lifestyles and perspectives, sharing,“Any identities outside of that are super hard to see, or they're super exaggerated” (P1). This was one of the most widely-reported themes; 14 out of 18 participants mentioned the overwhelming whiteness in their ads. Gender-nonconforming participants noted that even when systems accurately determined their gender identities, their targeted ads reflected heteropatriarchy assumptions about their experi-ences. P6, a non-binary lesbian, reflected on the inadequacy of the lesbian representation they saw in ads: “Where there’s a lesbian cou-ple, usually both women are white and very feminine [with] longhair—I don’t really think we’ll ever see that much butch [represen-tation] because of the way our culture constructs what a beautiful woman looks like” (P6). A non-binary participant reported, “I feel like [my ads] are targeted more towards trans men, or someonewho’s more masculine than I am” (P2). Participants also cited a lack of body diversity in the models they saw, in particular a lack of depictions of fatness and disability. Consistent with prior work [23], our participants considered this problematic: “I’m a fat person ... I’m part of a lot of groups for other fat people. I think a lot of ads show me weight loss [content]because they assume that ... I want to lose weight, so that’s one thing they get wrong” (P3). Another participant reported that their ads overlook “disability or chronic illness—I have some chronic illnesses and friends who do as well, and it can be hard to see ads that don’t represent your queer friend group” (P5). Aside from their concerns about ad content, all participants reflected some degree of awareness and discomfort with ad target-ing systems identifying them as queer, a type of inference they were easily able to identify: “[Unlike ads for straight people,] you can really tell the ad targeting is for queer people; [advertisers]make it so obvious” (P18). Their responses to these inference- and categorization-based systems’ treatment ranged from mild discom-fort to experiences of significant emotional harm.4.2.1 Ad targeting made participants feel unsettled and unsafe.While participants expressed frustration with targeted advertis-ing that missed the mark, they shared that that accurate targeting often felt “creepy” (P8), “disconcerting” (P13), and even “scary” (P3).Creepiness, in particular, was a recurring theme. P3 reported feeling torn between the desire for convenience and this creepiness: “I get kind of creeped out when [ad systems] seem like they know a lot of things about my life and my interests. [...] From convenience sake,I’ll be more likely to see things that I’d be interested in ... but then,on the other hand, I don’t like advertisements and how all these places are collecting personal data about me” (P3).Taking the same perspective from the opposite direction, P4described that misrepresentative content sometimes felt reassur-ing, in that the ad targeting system “doesn’t really know me” (P4).Feeling “seen” by targeted ad systems frequently felt as much like surveillance as inclusion. In the United Sates, where most majora's platforms are based, legal protection of queer identities is based on the right to privacy [30]; it is unsurprising, then, that queerpeople’s privacy concerns are highly specific, and connected to their larger concerns about their civil rights. P11, a lesbian transwoman who expressed a desire for ads more relevant to her transidentity, expressed simultaneous concern: “I just don’t love the idea that the internet sees me for me, because that’s kind of danger-ous sometimes. There are state legislatures and whole countries that have passed laws to try to make it difficult, if not straight-up impossible, for me to live” (P11).4.2.2 Participants made sense of ad targeting and its failures. Partic-ipants had many plausible hypotheses for the mechanisms behind their targeted ads, including their own behaviors (P18: “I like to do creative writing so I go to baby name websites to look for names for characters, and ... the ads might be thinking, oh this person is pregnant because they’re looking up baby names”), and advertisers lacking nuanced understandings of queerness (P1, a gay middle eastern man, described many of his ads as “completely alienating to other members of the community [besides white gay men]”).Another common explanation participants pointed to was the advertising industry itself. P14 described white-centric ad content as being reflective of “the nature of the advertising business”, as well as broader social norms: “A lot of the ads showcase white gay male models—cisgender, white models—which, I mean, that’s obviously problematic, but it’s also a reflection of kind of the hegemonic discourse that is almost always in queer spaces, right? Unless you’rein a particularly non-white space.” (P14)4.2.3 Corporate tokenization of queerness contributes to skepticism. I don’t want them to market toward me—like, I don't think that companies can have a genuine care about communities that I’m part of, so I’d rather they [not] before and try to just get my money. (P4)Many participants were attuned to the financial incentives for brands targeting queer customers. They found this motive oppor-tunistic and profit-seeking, describing it as undermining the value of representation: “They’re all trying to get me to buy things, that’swhat their end goal is, because capitalism. So I feel like that’s a root of problematic advertising, is that they don’t really care about the impact, they just want you to buy” (P3). In the context of trans-gender representation, P18 expressed that increased inclusion feltshallow and performative: “[Many organizations are] jumping on the bandwagon, and when it actually comes down to support trans rights, they’re not there” (P18). Several participants reported that this kind of opportunistic rep-resentation, which they described as tokenizing, insincere, or pink-washing, was especially common during Pride Month, even from brands and organizations that otherwise did not otherwise make an effort to include queer customers among their customer base: “During Pride Month in New York, where there were a lot of ads Ifelt didn’t really target me correctly—they were just like, here’s the corporation, we put a rainbow logo on it” (P5).4.2.4 Queer people suffer emotional harms due to ad targeting.I think it’s the ads that are creating unrealistic image of our community and of ourselves. (P8)As described in 4.1, participants found themselves targeted with some content that was obviously damaging, including ads for al-cohol (given that members of the LGBTQ+ community are dispro-portionately likely to suffer from substance abuse issues [50]), and those for weight loss (P3: “I would say, yeah, probably more so when I was younger than now, but still I would say [weight loss ads] probably do impact my body image issues”).Participants, especially (but not exclusively) those identifying as trans and non-binary, frequently reported feeling misgendered by their targeted ads. Misgendering—when the gendered elements of language used or the underlying inferences made about someone are incongruent with an individual’s gender identity—is a form of harm commonly experienced by transgender people, though it can occur to others as well [42]. One non-binary participant (who doesn't identify as a woman) described feeling misgendered by their ads:“I feel the misrepresentation the most when it has to do with babies,and I feel like those ads are always very gendered, very targeted towards women and society’s idea of [what] a mother or a womanist. [Those] ads make me feel very weird” (P2). Explaining the impact this has on their self-image, they said, “When I see ads, especially marriage- and pregnancy-related ads that are targeted towards women, it does make [me] feel like, oh no, is this how people[in real life] see me, if this is what my browsing data indicates?”(P2). A cisgender gay male participant also reported receiving ads targeted to women, and that this made him question his identity for a time: “I did struggle a lot with my gender identity for a while because when you’re constantly getting ... ads targeted for a female,I was like, how do I identify? [...] I think it does create a lot of confusion” (P1). This feeling of confusion was also echoed by anon-binary participant who reported that the oscillating gender essentialist extremes in their ads led them to conclude that these systems found their identity “confusing.” They explained, “For some reason I get a lot of ads related to pregnancy or having children.On the other end of the spectrum, I get a lot of ads for jocks straps,which I don’t really understand. But I think [the system is] very confused about what my gender is” (P18).In addition to these direct harms, participants also expressed experiencing more nebulous harm caused by ads acting as a reminder of power and privilege in society at large. As P12 thoughtfully put it, “If [ad targeting] took into account [queer] identities, I would feel like at least I’m recognized in society. But if they do not ... I[am reminded that] I’m left out, that many people do not accept me as who I am” (P12). In addition to understanding participants’ criticisms of ad targeting content and systems, we were interested in hearing their generative perspectives—changes they felt could improve their experiences with targeted ads. Proposed shifts included more diverse ad content,more transparency about the ad targeting process, more autonomy in the use and collection of people’s personal data, and the ability to forgo targeted advertising in its current form entirely.4.3.1 Queer people want more diversity in ad content.It has to be actually really nuanced and critical, it can't just be representation for the sake of making [brands]look better on the surface.

Another, despite seeing some ads geared towards queer people, noted that “most of the ads I see I typically feature straight couples” (P2). This aligns with prior work about ads’ reflections of dominant culture [60].4.1.2 Representations of queerness perpetuate stereotypes. The overall lack of queer representation was exacerbated by the heavy pres-ence of stereotypes in targeted ads seemingly intended to interestqueer consumers. In line with Kates [36]’s assessment that advertis-ing as an activity reflects dominant discourses, P1 described feeling caricatured: “It’s like the stereotype of what a gay man is ... like super dramatized, a point where I’m like, I don’t know anybody who acts like that. [...] I don’t know who’s relating to that; it’s [how]straight people think gay people act” (P1).More specifically, participants mentioned seeing stereotypes relating queerness to promiscuity and substance use. P6 describe some of the ads they saw as “hypersexualized”: “The advertisements are all, like, nightclub lighting, like all of these hot 32-year-old with basically all their clothes off, dancing and making out with each other” (P6). They clarified, “I don’t think that’s bad, it looks like they’re having a great time, but it’s really weird. I’m not sure if I consider it offensive or not.” Another described the ads they saw representing queer people as “pertaining to drinking, like fo rbeers” (P15). Unfortunately, this is nothing new; as prior literature has recorded, and some of our older participants remembered, such stereotypes reflect historical patterns in advertising [60]. P13 (age41) noted, “It used to be [that] alcohol and cigarettes were the only companies [with] gay [representation in] ads, so that felt a little stigmatizing” (P13).Other participants also felt misrepresented by content that, de-spite featuring appropriate representations of queerness, did not align with their own personal queer identities. For instance, a high-femme lesbian participant pointed out that the queer-targeted ads she received made “incorrect assumptions” about her gender presentation: “While I am gay, that does not immediately imply that Iwant to dress androgynously” (P11).4.1.3 Lack of diversity especially impacts those with intersecting identities. The lack of diversity in ad content was especially notice-able for those holding multiple marginalized identities, including participants of color; trans, non-binary, and gender-nonconforming participants; those with disabilities; and fat participants. A majority of participants observed a lack of racial diversity in their targeted ads; both white and non-white participants had their targeted advertisements dominated by depictions of white people. P1, a gay Iraqi man, described his targeted ads as being centered on white Western lifestyles and perspectives, sharing,“Any identities outside of that are super hard to see, or they're super exaggerated” (P1). This was one of the most widely-reported themes; 14 out of 18 participants mentioned the overwhelming whiteness in their ads. Gender-nonconforming participants noted that even when systems accurately determined their gender identities, their targeted ads reflected heteropatriarchy assumptions about their experi-ences. P6, a non-binary lesbian, reflected on the inadequacy of the lesbian representation they saw in ads: “Where there’s a lesbian cou-ple, usually both women are white and very feminine [with] longhair—I don’t really think we’ll ever see that much butch [represen-tation] because of the way our culture constructs what a beautiful woman looks like” (P6). A non-binary participant reported, “I feel like [my ads] are targeted more towards trans men, or someonewho’s more masculine than I am” (P2). Participants also cited a lack of body diversity in the models they saw, in particular a lack of depictions of fatness and disability. Consistent with prior work [23], our participants considered this problematic: “I’m a fat person ... I’m part of a lot of groups for other fat people. I think a lot of ads show me weight loss [content]because they assume that ... I want to lose weight, so that’s one thing they get wrong” (P3). Another participant reported that their ads overlook “disability or chronic illness—I have some chronic illnesses and friends who do as well, and it can be hard to see ads that don’t represent your queer friend group” (P5). Aside from their concerns about ad content, all participants reflected some degree of awareness and discomfort with ad target-ing systems identifying them as queer, a type of inference they were easily able to identify: “[Unlike ads for straight people,] you can really tell the ad targeting is for queer people; [advertisers]make it so obvious” (P18). Their responses to these inference- and categorization-based systems’ treatment ranged from mild discom-fort to experiences of significant emotional harm.4.2.1 Ad targeting made participants feel unsettled and unsafe.While participants expressed frustration with targeted advertis-ing that missed the mark, they shared that that accurate targeting often felt “creepy” (P8), “disconcerting” (P13), and even “scary” (P3).Creepiness, in particular, was a recurring theme. P3 reported feeling torn between the desire for convenience and this creepiness: “I get kind of creeped out when [ad systems] seem like they know a lot of things about my life and my interests. [...] From convenience sake,I’ll be more likely to see things that I’d be interested in ... but then,on the other hand, I don’t like advertisements and how all these places are collecting personal data about me” (P3).Taking the same perspective from the opposite direction, P4described that misrepresentative content sometimes felt reassur-ing, in that the ad targeting system “doesn’t really know me” (P4).Feeling “seen” by targeted ad systems frequently felt as much like surveillance as inclusion. In the United Sates, where most majora's platforms are based, legal protection of queer identities is based on the right to privacy [30]; it is unsurprising, then, that queerpeople’s privacy concerns are highly specific, and connected to their larger concerns about their civil rights. P11, a lesbian transwoman who expressed a desire for ads more relevant to her transidentity, expressed simultaneous concern: “I just don’t love the idea that the internet sees me for me, because that’s kind of danger-ous sometimes. There are state legislatures and whole countries that have passed laws to try to make it difficult, if not straight-up impossible, for me to live” (P11).4.2.2 Participants made sense of ad targeting and its failures. Partic-ipants had many plausible hypotheses for the mechanisms behind their targeted ads, including their own behaviors (P18: “I like to do creative writing so I go to baby name websites to look for names for characters, and ... the ads might be thinking, oh this person is pregnant because they’re looking up baby names”), and advertisers lacking nuanced understandings of queerness (P1, a gay middle eastern man, described many of his ads as “completely alienating to other members of the community [besides white gay men]”).Another common explanation participants pointed to was the advertising industry itself. P14 described white-centric ad content as being reflective of “the nature of the advertising business”, as well as broader social norms: “A lot of the ads showcase white gay male models—cisgender, white models—which, I mean, that’s obviously problematic, but it’s also a reflection of kind of the hegemonic discourse that is almost always in queer spaces, right? Unless you’rein a particularly non-white space.” (P14)4.2.3 Corporate tokenization of queerness contributes to skepticism. I don’t want them to market toward me—like, I don't think that companies can have a genuine care about communities that I’m part of, so I’d rather they [not] before and try to just get my money. (P4)Many participants were attuned to the financial incentives for brands targeting queer customers. They found this motive oppor-tunistic and profit-seeking, describing it as undermining the value of representation: “They’re all trying to get me to buy things, that’swhat their end goal is, because capitalism. So I feel like that’s a root of problematic advertising, is that they don’t really care about the impact, they just want you to buy” (P3). In the context of trans-gender representation, P18 expressed that increased inclusion feltshallow and performative: “[Many organizations are] jumping on the bandwagon, and when it actually comes down to support trans rights, they’re not there” (P18). Several participants reported that this kind of opportunistic rep-resentation, which they described as tokenizing, insincere, or pink-washing, was especially common during Pride Month, even from brands and organizations that otherwise did not otherwise make an effort to include queer customers among their customer base: “During Pride Month in New York, where there were a lot of ads Ifelt didn’t really target me correctly—they were just like, here’s the corporation, we put a rainbow logo on it” (P5).4.2.4 Queer people suffer emotional harms due to ad targeting.I think it’s the ads that are creating unrealistic image of our community and of ourselves. (P8)As described in 4.1, participants found themselves targeted with some content that was obviously damaging, including ads for al-cohol (given that members of the LGBTQ+ community are dispro-portionately likely to suffer from substance abuse issues [50]), and those for weight loss (P3: “I would say, yeah, probably more so when I was younger than now, but still I would say [weight loss ads] probably do impact my body image issues”).Participants, especially (but not exclusively) those identifying as trans and non-binary, frequently reported feeling misgendered by their targeted ads. Misgendering—when the gendered elements of language used or the underlying inferences made about someone are incongruent with an individual’s gender identity—is a form of harm commonly experienced by transgender people, though it can occur to others as well [42]. One non-binary participant (who doesn't identify as a woman) described feeling misgendered by their ads:“I feel the misrepresentation the most when it has to do with babies,and I feel like those ads are always very gendered, very targeted towards women and society’s idea of [what] a mother or a womanist. [Those] ads make me feel very weird” (P2). Explaining the impact this has on their self-image, they said, “When I see ads, especially marriage- and pregnancy-related ads that are targeted towards women, it does make [me] feel like, oh no, is this how people[in real life] see me, if this is what my browsing data indicates?”(P2). A cisgender gay male participant also reported receiving ads targeted to women, and that this made him question his identity for a time: “I did struggle a lot with my gender identity for a while because when you’re constantly getting ... ads targeted for a female,I was like, how do I identify? [...] I think it does create a lot of confusion” (P1). This feeling of confusion was also echoed by anon-binary participant who reported that the oscillating gender essentialist extremes in their ads led them to conclude that these systems found their identity “confusing.” They explained, “For some reason I get a lot of ads related to pregnancy or having children.On the other end of the spectrum, I get a lot of ads for jocks straps,which I don’t really understand. But I think [the system is] very confused about what my gender is” (P18).In addition to these direct harms, participants also expressed experiencing more nebulous harm caused by ads acting as a reminder of power and privilege in society at large. As P12 thoughtfully put it, “If [ad targeting] took into account [queer] identities, I would feel like at least I’m recognized in society. But if they do not ... I[am reminded that] I’m left out, that many people do not accept me as who I am” (P12). In addition to understanding participants’ criticisms of ad targeting content and systems, we were interested in hearing their generative perspectives—changes they felt could improve their experiences with targeted ads. Proposed shifts included more diverse ad content,more transparency about the ad targeting process, more autonomy in the use and collection of people’s personal data, and the ability to forgo targeted advertising in its current form entirely.4.3.1 Queer people want more diversity in ad content.It has to be actually really nuanced and critical, it can't just be representation for the sake of making [brands]look better on the surface. (P4)We previously discussed participants’ frustration with the preva-lence of stereotypes in the content that they encountered. A solution many identified was to increase diverse representation in ad con-tent. Participants highlighted the need for more racially diverse depictions of queer people, and for more body diversity in general. P16 voiced a desire to see more “people of all different appearances and sizes and races and presentations. A lot of times people like myself—thin, white, [female-assigned] people ... are the kind of[non-binary] people getting attention in the media.”Even the participants most skeptical of targeted advertising impact on queer communities acknowledged the value that rep-resentation holds for queer people, especially for its role in the identity formation of queer youth:If there were to be more [queer] representation, I also think having [it normalize] our identities—how we look and how we identify, or who we are—having that normalized [for] someone who’s young, maybe younger than 12, [to] see this representation and feel some kind of connection to it. [...] That is monumental,and something I would advocate more for. (P15)Participants did, however, understand visibility as a double-edged sword, with the potential to impact public perceptions ofLGBTQ+ people and communities both positively and negatively—something supported by prior research in television and print ad-vertising [7, 64]. As P16 put it: “You have to watch what’s going on out there, because for some people that aren’t in the LGBT commu-nity their only exposure to queer people might be through these ads, and they might be basing their views off those ads”.Many participants noted that improved diversity should not bedone solely to improve a brand’s rapport with queer consumers.Instead, they expressed a desire for advertisers to include nuancedqueer representation in content with broad reach. To quote P2, “[Iwant] more queer people and queer relationship representation,just in mainstream ads—I feel like a lot of the queer ads I see are just for queer-specific things”. Moreover, they wanted advertisers to back up visual cues with action and not, in the words of P4, “before and try to just get my money.” P16 echoed the same sentiment,drawing on the idea of “rainbow capitalism” [13]: “I think if I go to the website and they were just using [queer imagery] to attract people and not following through—you know, rainbow capitalism—that would further turn me off from the product. But if they had marketing I felt represented in and also supported causes I believed in, I would be more likely to support them, for sure” (P16).4.3.2 Queer people want more transparency and autonomy.[It’s scary] how much we’re already monitored, and how much [ad systems] already know about me. [...] [I Would prefer] increasing the amount of diversity within advertisements, without necessarily needing to know for sure if somebody identifies a certain way. (P15)The current user experience of ad platforms leaves little room for direct user input, a power differential noted by our participants.They were highly critical of the inference and categorization done by these systems and the lack of room for self-determination. They Suggested alternatives, including greater transparency about how they were being targeted, the ability to express boundaries or dis-content with certain ad content, and control over which advertisers could bid for their attention. For example, P1 began, “I wish [ads]in general communicated why they’re showing an ad to you” andalso described wanting “autonomy over whether or not I want to disclose a certain part of my identity on my own terms ... rather than just being tracked” (P1).P6 picked up this theme, describing unease with “the sense of being watched, being tracked,” and pointing out the particular pri-vacy needs of many LGBT people that are not publicly out: “If You're not out yet, [you might] be afraid that your mom’s going tobe looking over your shoulder [while you are] scrolling throughInstagram” (P6). Other participants also mentioned concerns about security and privacy online, including P14: “I think in the globalInternet age everyone is very, very concerned about privacy and security. I don’t know what to do about that—and this is again working with the assumption that I must live with [targeted] ads. I Would rather have companies ask me [instead of inferring] ... so I Can just decline” (P14).4.3.3 Queer people imagine the ability to opt out entirely. Partic-ipants’ desire for autonomy frequently stemmed from a wish to escape ad targeting systems altogether. One participant made clear their desire to avoid ad targeting specifically, despite being com-fortable and even interested in other types of ads: “Get rid of [it]... I feel like people around me don’t shop based on seeing what-ever is available in ads. [Instead they] buy things because they become popular, or [when] a curator”—a “real person, influencer or otherwise”—“promotes an item” (P10). When asked what she would change about ads if she could change anything, P11 also said, “I Would probably get rid of it. If you gave me a magic wand that can change anything about online advertising, I wouldn’t have online advertising” (P11).",1713-17,reflected some degree of awareness and discomfort with ad target-ing systems identifying them as queer
37,FinancialIncentives,constrainsAgent,Brands,"We conducted 18 semi-structured interviews over Zoom lasting between 30 and 45 minutes, which were recorded for transcription and analysis. Participants received a written consent form before the interviews and were compensated with a $15 Amazon gift card distributed via email afterward. Participants in this paper are identified by unique anonymous identifiers (P1 - P18) to maintain their privacy. Our study was reviewed and approved by the StanfordUniversity Institutional Review Board.In the interviews, we asked about participants’ experiences with online advertising in three parts: first asking questions about their experiences overall with online ads, second asking them to reflect on ad targeting and its relationship to various aspects of their iden-tities, and third relating to their identity as an LGBTQ+ person. The Complete interview guide is listed in Appendix A. At the close of the interview, we asked participants open-ended demographic ques-tions, having them provide any or all of the following in their own words: age, gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity, and nationality.Part 1: Online advertising. We asked participants which platforms they were most active on, how frequently they encountered ads on those platforms, and what types of advertising they encountered.We also sought to understand how and why participants engaged with ads they considered compelling, asking participants to recall an ad they had recently interacted with and reflect on the charac-teristics, including aspects of the images or text, that drew their attention.Part 2: Ad targeting. Next, to understand participants’ beliefs about what inferences ad platforms may be making and how they believe such inferences are made, we asked them to reflect on the kinds of themes, people, and other imagery they usually see in their targeted ads, and speculate as to why they receive such content. Wealso explored the relationship of this content with multiple aspects of their identities, asking about feelings of mis/representation and whether or not they wanted these identity aspects to be represented and/or inferred by ad targeting systems.Part 3: Targeted ads and LGBTQ+ identity. In our final set of interview questions, we explored participants’ perceptions of pos-itive and negative impacts on LGBTQ+ people and communities.In relation to negative impacts, we asked further questions about participants' knowledge and use of strategies for avoiding ad tar-geting, as well as what they would like to see changed (including more realistic and more speculative ideas). Though extant theoretical frameworks shaped our inquiries in this work, our goal was to let the patterns of our data guide our anal-ysis, so we chose a reflexive approach [11]. Initially, one author conducted line-by-line open coding of all transcripts to develop a codebook of keywords and sub-keywords. Using this codebook,another author took a second pass, coding the transcripts a second time and updating, replacing, or adding additional keywords as needed. The first coding pass was conducted using NVivo qual-itative analysis software, while the second was conducted usingDelve for better collaboration. After collaborative discussions of the coded content, these two authors came to a consensus about the final set of codes and coded content. Examples of codes included: “binary gender norms”, “control/autonomy”, “lacking nuance”, and“feels creepy”.Themes were collaboratively synthesized based on the most prevalent codes, developed narratively, and divided into three major sets of insights pertaining to participants’ views on ad content, ad targeting as it currently exists, and ideals and alternatives they envisioned. We re-referenced the interview transcripts to refine and finalize themes, ensuring they emerged as directly as possible from our data. This study involves data collection with LGBTQ+ individuals, a group that has specific privacy and safety concerns. This is espe-cially true given the range of risks faced by some queer people due to their nationalities (homosexuality is still criminalized in some countries [57]), gender identities (transgender people, especially transfeminine people of color, face a disproportionate risk of vio-lence [22]), and other attributes. We, the research team, took care of our recruitment, data collection, and analysis to retain their con-fidentiality, including not requiring participants to provide their legal names, compensating them using gift cards not attached to their legal identities, and ensuring that only the research team had access to the transcripts and recordings. Additionally, we acknowl-edge the tensions and risks inherent to conducting research focused on marginalized communities and individuals [40]. Our resulting analysis is not only shaped by a theoretical grounding in queer and feminist theory, but each author’s individual experiences as a per-son marginalized along the axes of gender, race, sexuality, ethnicity,and other identities (with overlaps and privileges therein). We divide our findings regarding ad content into three main points:the overarching lack of representations of queerness, stereotypical-ity when such identities were seen in ads, and the particular lack of representation faced by those with multiple marginalized identities.4.1.1 Participants’ ads reflect heterosexual societal norms. Although participants did widely report receiving ads targeted to them that depicted queer people, across the board they reported that many or most of the ads they saw were instead reflective of dominant hetero-sexual societal norms. P5 summarized, “I think there is starting to become change, but I see a lot of ... stereotypically, traditionally beau-tiful [people in ads] who are tall, or thin, or white, or able-bodied,etc.” (P5). This was echoed by other participants; P16 described the people they saw as being “generally either thin white men or thin white women. Generally attractive people” (P16). Another, despite seeing some ads geared towards queer people, noted that “most of the ads I see I typically feature straight couples” (P2). This aligns with prior work about ads’ reflections of dominant culture [60].4.1.2 Representations of queerness perpetuate stereotypes. The overall lack of queer representation was exacerbated by the heavy pres-ence of stereotypes in targeted ads seemingly intended to interestqueer consumers.

In addition to understanding participants’ criticisms of ad targeting content and systems, we were interested in hearing their generative perspectives—changes they felt could improve their experiences with targeted ads. Proposed shifts included more diverse ad content,more transparency about the ad targeting process, more autonomy in the use and collection of people’s personal data, and the ability to forgo targeted advertising in its current form entirely.4.3.1 Queer people want more diversity in ad content.It has to be actually really nuanced and critical, it can't just be representation for the sake of making [brands]look better on the surface. (P4)We previously discussed participants’ frustration with the preva-lence of stereotypes in the content that they encountered. A solution many identified was to increase diverse representation in ad con-tent. Participants highlighted the need for more racially diverse depictions of queer people, and for more body diversity in general. P16 voiced a desire to see more “people of all different appearances and sizes and races and presentations. A lot of times people like myself—thin, white, [female-assigned] people ... are the kind of[non-binary] people getting attention in the media.”Even the participants most skeptical of targeted advertising impact on queer communities acknowledged the value that rep-resentation holds for queer people, especially for its role in the identity formation of queer youth:If there were to be more [queer] representation, I also think having [it normalize] our identities—how we look and how we identify, or who we are—having that normalized [for] someone who’s young, maybe younger than 12, [to] see this representation and feel some kind of connection to it. [...] That is monumental,and something I would advocate more for. (P15)Participants did, however, understand visibility as a double-edged sword, with the potential to impact public perceptions ofLGBTQ+ people and communities both positively and negatively—something supported by prior research in television and print ad-vertising [7, 64]. As P16 put it: “You have to watch what’s going on out there, because for some people that aren’t in the LGBT commu-nity their only exposure to queer people might be through these ads, and they might be basing their views off those ads”.Many participants noted that improved diversity should not bedone solely to improve a brand’s rapport with queer consumers.Instead, they expressed a desire for advertisers to include nuancedqueer representation in content with broad reach. To quote P2, “[Iwant] more queer people and queer relationship representation,just in mainstream ads—I feel like a lot of the queer ads I see are just for queer-specific things”. Moreover, they wanted advertisers to back up visual cues with action and not, in the words of P4, “before and try to just get my money.” P16 echoed the same sentiment,drawing on the idea of “rainbow capitalism” [13]: “I think if I go to the website and they were just using [queer imagery] to attract people and not following through—you know, rainbow capitalism—that would further turn me off from the product. But if they had marketing I felt represented in and also supported causes I believed in, I would be more likely to support them, for sure” (P16).4.3.2 Queer people want more transparency and autonomy.[It’s scary] how much we’re already monitored, and how much [ad systems] already know about me. [...] [I Would prefer] increasing the amount of diversity within advertisements, without necessarily needing to know for sure if somebody identifies a certain way. (P15)The current user experience of ad platforms leaves little room for direct user input, a power differential noted by our participants.They were highly critical of the inference and categorization done by these systems and the lack of room for self-determination. They Suggested alternatives, including greater transparency about how they were being targeted, the ability to express boundaries or dis-content with certain ad content, and control over which advertisers could bid for their attention. For example, P1 began, “I wish [ads]in general communicated why they’re showing an ad to you” andalso described wanting “autonomy over whether or not I want to disclose a certain part of my identity on my own terms ... rather than just being tracked” (P1).P6 picked up this theme, describing unease with “the sense of being watched, being tracked,” and pointing out the particular pri-vacy needs of many LGBT people that are not publicly out: “If You're not out yet, [you might] be afraid that your mom’s going tobe looking over your shoulder [while you are] scrolling throughInstagram” (P6). Other participants also mentioned concerns about security and privacy online, including P14: “I think in the globalInternet age everyone is very, very concerned about privacy and security. I don’t know what to do about that—and this is again working with the assumption that I must live with [targeted] ads. I Would rather have companies ask me [instead of inferring] ... so I Can just decline” (P14).4.3.3 Queer people imagine the ability to opt out entirely. Partic-ipants’ desire for autonomy frequently stemmed from a wish to escape ad targeting systems altogether. One participant made clear their desire to avoid ad targeting specifically, despite being com-fortable and even interested in other types of ads: “Get rid of [it]... I feel like people around me don’t shop based on seeing what-ever is available in ads. [Instead they] buy things because they become popular, or [when] a curator”—a “real person, influencer or otherwise”—“promotes an item” (P10). When asked what she would change about ads if she could change anything, P11 also said, “I Would probably get rid of it. If you gave me a magic wand that can change anything about online advertising, I wouldn’t have online advertising” (P11).",1713-17,Many participants were attuned to the financial incentives for brands targeting queer customers.
38,Advertisements,influencesPrecept,GenderIdentityQuestioning,"We conducted 18 semi-structured interviews over Zoom lasting between 30 and 45 minutes, which were recorded for transcription and analysis. Participants received a written consent form before the interviews and were compensated with a $15 Amazon gift card distributed via email afterward. Participants in this paper are identified by unique anonymous identifiers (P1 - P18) to maintain their privacy. Our study was reviewed and approved by the StanfordUniversity Institutional Review Board.In the interviews, we asked about participants’ experiences with online advertising in three parts: first asking questions about their experiences overall with online ads, second asking them to reflect on ad targeting and its relationship to various aspects of their iden-tities, and third relating to their identity as an LGBTQ+ person. The Complete interview guide is listed in Appendix A. At the close of the interview, we asked participants open-ended demographic ques-tions, having them provide any or all of the following in their own words: age, gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity, and nationality.Part 1: Online advertising. We asked participants which platforms they were most active on, how frequently they encountered ads on those platforms, and what types of advertising they encountered.We also sought to understand how and why participants engaged with ads they considered compelling, asking participants to recall an ad they had recently interacted with and reflect on the charac-teristics, including aspects of the images or text, that drew their attention.Part 2: Ad targeting. Next, to understand participants’ beliefs about what inferences ad platforms may be making and how they believe such inferences are made, we asked them to reflect on the kinds of themes, people, and other imagery they usually see in their targeted ads, and speculate as to why they receive such content. Wealso explored the relationship of this content with multiple aspects of their identities, asking about feelings of mis/representation and whether or not they wanted these identity aspects to be represented and/or inferred by ad targeting systems.Part 3: Targeted ads and LGBTQ+ identity. In our final set of interview questions, we explored participants’ perceptions of pos-itive and negative impacts on LGBTQ+ people and communities.In relation to negative impacts, we asked further questions about participants' knowledge and use of strategies for avoiding ad tar-geting, as well as what they would like to see changed (including more realistic and more speculative ideas). Though extant theoretical frameworks shaped our inquiries in this work, our goal was to let the patterns of our data guide our anal-ysis, so we chose a reflexive approach [11]. Initially, one author conducted line-by-line open coding of all transcripts to develop a codebook of keywords and sub-keywords. Using this codebook,another author took a second pass, coding the transcripts a second time and updating, replacing, or adding additional keywords as needed. The first coding pass was conducted using NVivo qual-itative analysis software, while the second was conducted usingDelve for better collaboration. After collaborative discussions of the coded content, these two authors came to a consensus about the final set of codes and coded content. Examples of codes included: “binary gender norms”, “control/autonomy”, “lacking nuance”, and“feels creepy”.Themes were collaboratively synthesized based on the most prevalent codes, developed narratively, and divided into three major sets of insights pertaining to participants’ views on ad content, ad targeting as it currently exists, and ideals and alternatives they envisioned. We re-referenced the interview transcripts to refine and finalize themes, ensuring they emerged as directly as possible from our data. This study involves data collection with LGBTQ+ individuals, a group that has specific privacy and safety concerns. This is espe-cially true given the range of risks faced by some queer people due to their nationalities (homosexuality is still criminalized in some countries [57]), gender identities (transgender people, especially transfeminine people of color, face a disproportionate risk of vio-lence [22]), and other attributes. We, the research team, took care of our recruitment, data collection, and analysis to retain their con-fidentiality, including not requiring participants to provide their legal names, compensating them using gift cards not attached to their legal identities, and ensuring that only the research team had access to the transcripts and recordings. Additionally, we acknowl-edge the tensions and risks inherent to conducting research focused on marginalized communities and individuals [40]. Our resulting analysis is not only shaped by a theoretical grounding in queer and feminist theory, but each author’s individual experiences as a per-son marginalized along the axes of gender, race, sexuality, ethnicity,and other identities (with overlaps and privileges therein). We divide our findings regarding ad content into three main points:the overarching lack of representations of queerness, stereotypical-ity when such identities were seen in ads, and the particular lack of representation faced by those with multiple marginalized identities.4.1.1 Participants’ ads reflect heterosexual societal norms. Although participants did widely report receiving ads targeted to them that depicted queer people, across the board they reported that many or most of the ads they saw were instead reflective of dominant hetero-sexual societal norms. P5 summarized, “I think there is starting to become change, but I see a lot of ... stereotypically, traditionally beau-tiful [people in ads] who are tall, or thin, or white, or able-bodied,etc.” (P5). This was echoed by other participants; P16 described the people they saw as being “generally either thin white men or thin white women. Generally attractive people” (P16). Another, despite seeing some ads geared towards queer people, noted that “most of the ads I see I typically feature straight couples” (P2). This aligns with prior work about ads’ reflections of dominant culture [60].4.1.2 Representations of queerness perpetuate stereotypes. The overall lack of queer representation was exacerbated by the heavy pres-ence of stereotypes in targeted ads seemingly intended to interestqueer consumers. In line with Kates [36]’s assessment that advertis-ing as an activity reflects dominant discourses, P1 described feeling caricatured: “It’s like the stereotype of what a gay man is ... like super dramatized, a point where I’m like, I don’t know anybody who acts like that. [...] I don’t know who’s relating to that; it’s [how]straight people think gay people act” (P1).More specifically, participants mentioned seeing stereotypes relating queerness to promiscuity and substance use. P6 describe some of the ads they saw as “hypersexualized”: “The advertisements are all, like, nightclub lighting, like all of these hot 32-year-old with basically all their clothes off, dancing and making out with each other” (P6). They clarified, “I don’t think that’s bad, it looks like they’re having a great time, but it’s really weird. I’m not sure if I consider it offensive or not.” Another described the ads they saw representing queer people as “pertaining to drinking, like fo rbeers” (P15). Unfortunately, this is nothing new; as prior literature has recorded, and some of our older participants remembered, such stereotypes reflect historical patterns in advertising [60]. P13 (age41) noted, “It used to be [that] alcohol and cigarettes were the only companies [with] gay [representation in] ads, so that felt a little stigmatizing” (P13).Other participants also felt misrepresented by content that, de-spite featuring appropriate representations of queerness, did not align with their own personal queer identities. For instance, a high-femme lesbian participant pointed out that the queer-targeted ads she received made “incorrect assumptions” about her gender presentation: “While I am gay, that does not immediately imply that Iwant to dress androgynously” (P11).4.1.3 Lack of diversity especially impacts those with intersecting identities. The lack of diversity in ad content was especially notice-able for those holding multiple marginalized identities, including participants of color; trans, non-binary, and gender-nonconforming participants; those with disabilities; and fat participants. A majority of participants observed a lack of racial diversity in their targeted ads; both white and non-white participants had their targeted advertisements dominated by depictions of white people. P1, a gay Iraqi man, described his targeted ads as being centered on white Western lifestyles and perspectives, sharing,“Any identities outside of that are super hard to see, or they're super exaggerated” (P1). This was one of the most widely-reported themes; 14 out of 18 participants mentioned the overwhelming whiteness in their ads. Gender-nonconforming participants noted that even when systems accurately determined their gender identities, their targeted ads reflected heteropatriarchy assumptions about their experi-ences. P6, a non-binary lesbian, reflected on the inadequacy of the lesbian representation they saw in ads: “Where there’s a lesbian cou-ple, usually both women are white and very feminine [with] longhair—I don’t really think we’ll ever see that much butch [represen-tation] because of the way our culture constructs what a beautiful woman looks like” (P6). A non-binary participant reported, “I feel like [my ads] are targeted more towards trans men, or someonewho’s more masculine than I am” (P2). Participants also cited a lack of body diversity in the models they saw, in particular a lack of depictions of fatness and disability. Consistent with prior work [23], our participants considered this problematic: “I’m a fat person ... I’m part of a lot of groups for other fat people. I think a lot of ads show me weight loss [content]because they assume that ... I want to lose weight, so that’s one thing they get wrong” (P3). Another participant reported that their ads overlook “disability or chronic illness—I have some chronic illnesses and friends who do as well, and it can be hard to see ads that don’t represent your queer friend group” (P5). Aside from their concerns about ad content, all participants reflected some degree of awareness and discomfort with ad target-ing systems identifying them as queer, a type of inference they were easily able to identify: “[Unlike ads for straight people,] you can really tell the ad targeting is for queer people; [advertisers]make it so obvious” (P18). Their responses to these inference- and categorization-based systems’ treatment ranged from mild discom-fort to experiences of significant emotional harm.4.2.1 Ad targeting made participants feel unsettled and unsafe.While participants expressed frustration with targeted advertis-ing that missed the mark, they shared that that accurate targeting often felt “creepy” (P8), “disconcerting” (P13), and even “scary” (P3).Creepiness, in particular, was a recurring theme. P3 reported feeling torn between the desire for convenience and this creepiness: “I get kind of creeped out when [ad systems] seem like they know a lot of things about my life and my interests. [...] From convenience sake,I’ll be more likely to see things that I’d be interested in ... but then,on the other hand, I don’t like advertisements and how all these places are collecting personal data about me” (P3).Taking the same perspective from the opposite direction, P4described that misrepresentative content sometimes felt reassur-ing, in that the ad targeting system “doesn’t really know me” (P4).Feeling “seen” by targeted ad systems frequently felt as much like surveillance as inclusion. In the United Sates, where most majora's platforms are based, legal protection of queer identities is based on the right to privacy [30]; it is unsurprising, then, that queerpeople’s privacy concerns are highly specific, and connected to their larger concerns about their civil rights. P11, a lesbian transwoman who expressed a desire for ads more relevant to her transidentity, expressed simultaneous concern: “I just don’t love the idea that the internet sees me for me, because that’s kind of danger-ous sometimes. There are state legislatures and whole countries that have passed laws to try to make it difficult, if not straight-up impossible, for me to live” (P11).4.2.2 Participants made sense of ad targeting and its failures. Partic-ipants had many plausible hypotheses for the mechanisms behind their targeted ads, including their own behaviors (P18: “I like to do creative writing so I go to baby name websites to look for names for characters, and ... the ads might be thinking, oh this person is pregnant because they’re looking up baby names”), and advertisers lacking nuanced understandings of queerness (P1, a gay middle eastern man, described many of his ads as “completely alienating to other members of the community [besides white gay men]”).Another common explanation participants pointed to was the advertising industry itself. P14 described white-centric ad content as being reflective of “the nature of the advertising business”, as well as broader social norms: “A lot of the ads showcase white gay male models—cisgender, white models—which, I mean, that’s obviously problematic, but it’s also a reflection of kind of the hegemonic discourse that is almost always in queer spaces, right? Unless you’rein a particularly non-white space.” (P14)4.2.3 Corporate tokenization of queerness contributes to skepticism. I don’t want them to market toward me—like, I don't think that companies can have a genuine care about communities that I’m part of, so I’d rather they [not] before and try to just get my money. (P4)Many participants were attuned to the financial incentives for brands targeting queer customers. They found this motive oppor-tunistic and profit-seeking, describing it as undermining the value of representation: “They’re all trying to get me to buy things, that’swhat their end goal is, because capitalism. So I feel like that’s a root of problematic advertising, is that they don’t really care about the impact, they just want you to buy” (P3). In the context of trans-gender representation, P18 expressed that increased inclusion feltshallow and performative: “[Many organizations are] jumping on the bandwagon, and when it actually comes down to support trans rights, they’re not there” (P18). Several participants reported that this kind of opportunistic rep-resentation, which they described as tokenizing, insincere, or pink-washing, was especially common during Pride Month, even from brands and organizations that otherwise did not otherwise make an effort to include queer customers among their customer base: “During Pride Month in New York, where there were a lot of ads Ifelt didn’t really target me correctly—they were just like, here’s the corporation, we put a rainbow logo on it” (P5).4.2.4 Queer people suffer emotional harms due to ad targeting.I think it’s the ads that are creating unrealistic image of our community and of ourselves. (P8)As described in 4.1, participants found themselves targeted with some content that was obviously damaging, including ads for al-cohol (given that members of the LGBTQ+ community are dispro-portionately likely to suffer from substance abuse issues [50]), and those for weight loss (P3: “I would say, yeah, probably more so when I was younger than now, but still I would say [weight loss ads] probably do impact my body image issues”).Participants, especially (but not exclusively) those identifying as trans and non-binary, frequently reported feeling misgendered by their targeted ads. Misgendering—when the gendered elements of language used or the underlying inferences made about someone are incongruent with an individual’s gender identity—is a form of harm commonly experienced by transgender people, though it can occur to others as well [42]. One non-binary participant (who doesn't identify as a woman) described feeling misgendered by their ads:“I feel the misrepresentation the most when it has to do with babies,and I feel like those ads are always very gendered, very targeted towards women and society’s idea of [what] a mother or a womanist. [Those] ads make me feel very weird” (P2). Explaining the impact this has on their self-image, they said, “When I see ads, especially marriage- and pregnancy-related ads that are targeted towards women, it does make [me] feel like, oh no, is this how people[in real life] see me, if this is what my browsing data indicates?”(P2). A cisgender gay male participant also reported receiving ads targeted to women, and that this made him question his identity for a time: “I did struggle a lot with my gender identity for a while because when you’re constantly getting ... ads targeted for a female,I was like, how do I identify? [...] I think it does create a lot of confusion” (P1). This feeling of confusion was also echoed by anon-binary participant who reported that the oscillating gender essentialist extremes in their ads led them to conclude that these systems found their identity “confusing.” They explained, “For some reason I get a lot of ads related to pregnancy or having children.On the other end of the spectrum, I get a lot of ads for jocks straps,which I don’t really understand. But I think [the system is] very confused about what my gender is” (P18).In addition to these direct harms, participants also expressed experiencing more nebulous harm caused by ads acting as a reminder of power and privilege in society at large. As P12 thoughtfully put it, “If [ad targeting] took into account [queer] identities, I would feel like at least I’m recognized in society. But if they do not ... I[am reminded that] I’m left out, that many people do not accept me as who I am” (P12). In addition to understanding participants’ criticisms of ad targeting content and systems, we were interested in hearing their generative perspectives—changes they felt could improve their experiences with targeted ads. Proposed shifts included more diverse ad content,more transparency about the ad targeting process, more autonomy in the use and collection of people’s personal data, and the ability to forgo targeted advertising in its current form entirely.4.3.1 Queer people want more diversity in ad content.It has to be actually really nuanced and critical, it can't just be representation for the sake of making [brands]look better on the surface.

P6 describe some of the ads they saw as “hypersexualized”: “The advertisements are all, like, nightclub lighting, like all of these hot 32-year-old with basically all their clothes off, dancing and making out with each other” (P6). They clarified, “I don’t think that’s bad, it looks like they’re having a great time, but it’s really weird. I’m not sure if I consider it offensive or not.” Another described the ads they saw representing queer people as “pertaining to drinking, like fo rbeers” (P15). Unfortunately, this is nothing new; as prior literature has recorded, and some of our older participants remembered, such stereotypes reflect historical patterns in advertising [60]. P13 (age41) noted, “It used to be [that] alcohol and cigarettes were the only companies [with] gay [representation in] ads, so that felt a little stigmatizing” (P13).Other participants also felt misrepresented by content that, de-spite featuring appropriate representations of queerness, did not align with their own personal queer identities. For instance, a high-femme lesbian participant pointed out that the queer-targeted ads she received made “incorrect assumptions” about her gender presentation: “While I am gay, that does not immediately imply that Iwant to dress androgynously” (P11).4.1.3 Lack of diversity especially impacts those with intersecting identities. The lack of diversity in ad content was especially notice-able for those holding multiple marginalized identities, including participants of color; trans, non-binary, and gender-nonconforming participants; those with disabilities; and fat participants. A majority of participants observed a lack of racial diversity in their targeted ads; both white and non-white participants had their targeted advertisements dominated by depictions of white people. P1, a gay Iraqi man, described his targeted ads as being centered on white Western lifestyles and perspectives, sharing,“Any identities outside of that are super hard to see, or they're super exaggerated” (P1). This was one of the most widely-reported themes; 14 out of 18 participants mentioned the overwhelming whiteness in their ads. Gender-nonconforming participants noted that even when systems accurately determined their gender identities, their targeted ads reflected heteropatriarchy assumptions about their experi-ences. P6, a non-binary lesbian, reflected on the inadequacy of the lesbian representation they saw in ads: “Where there’s a lesbian cou-ple, usually both women are white and very feminine [with] longhair—I don’t really think we’ll ever see that much butch [represen-tation] because of the way our culture constructs what a beautiful woman looks like” (P6). A non-binary participant reported, “I feel like [my ads] are targeted more towards trans men, or someonewho’s more masculine than I am” (P2). Participants also cited a lack of body diversity in the models they saw, in particular a lack of depictions of fatness and disability. Consistent with prior work [23], our participants considered this problematic: “I’m a fat person ... I’m part of a lot of groups for other fat people. I think a lot of ads show me weight loss [content]because they assume that ... I want to lose weight, so that’s one thing they get wrong” (P3). Another participant reported that their ads overlook “disability or chronic illness—I have some chronic illnesses and friends who do as well, and it can be hard to see ads that don’t represent your queer friend group” (P5). Aside from their concerns about ad content, all participants reflected some degree of awareness and discomfort with ad target-ing systems identifying them as queer, a type of inference they were easily able to identify: “[Unlike ads for straight people,] you can really tell the ad targeting is for queer people; [advertisers]make it so obvious” (P18). Their responses to these inference- and categorization-based systems’ treatment ranged from mild discom-fort to experiences of significant emotional harm.4.2.1 Ad targeting made participants feel unsettled and unsafe.While participants expressed frustration with targeted advertis-ing that missed the mark, they shared that that accurate targeting often felt “creepy” (P8), “disconcerting” (P13), and even “scary” (P3).Creepiness, in particular, was a recurring theme. P3 reported feeling torn between the desire for convenience and this creepiness: “I get kind of creeped out when [ad systems] seem like they know a lot of things about my life and my interests. [...] From convenience sake,I’ll be more likely to see things that I’d be interested in ... but then,on the other hand, I don’t like advertisements and how all these places are collecting personal data about me” (P3).Taking the same perspective from the opposite direction, P4described that misrepresentative content sometimes felt reassur-ing, in that the ad targeting system “doesn’t really know me” (P4).Feeling “seen” by targeted ad systems frequently felt as much like surveillance as inclusion. In the United Sates, where most majora's platforms are based, legal protection of queer identities is based on the right to privacy [30]; it is unsurprising, then, that queerpeople’s privacy concerns are highly specific, and connected to their larger concerns about their civil rights. P11, a lesbian transwoman who expressed a desire for ads more relevant to her transidentity, expressed simultaneous concern: “I just don’t love the idea that the internet sees me for me, because that’s kind of danger-ous sometimes. There are state legislatures and whole countries that have passed laws to try to make it difficult, if not straight-up impossible, for me to live” (P11).4.2.2 Participants made sense of ad targeting and its failures. Partic-ipants had many plausible hypotheses for the mechanisms behind their targeted ads, including their own behaviors (P18: “I like to do creative writing so I go to baby name websites to look for names for characters, and ... the ads might be thinking, oh this person is pregnant because they’re looking up baby names”), and advertisers lacking nuanced understandings of queerness (P1, a gay middle eastern man, described many of his ads as “completely alienating to other members of the community [besides white gay men]”).Another common explanation participants pointed to was the advertising industry itself. P14 described white-centric ad content as being reflective of “the nature of the advertising business”, as well as broader social norms: “A lot of the ads showcase white gay male models—cisgender, white models—which, I mean, that’s obviously problematic, but it’s also a reflection of kind of the hegemonic discourse that is almost always in queer spaces, right? Unless you’rein a particularly non-white space.” (P14)4.2.3 Corporate tokenization of queerness contributes to skepticism. I don’t want them to market toward me—like, I don't think that companies can have a genuine care about communities that I’m part of, so I’d rather they [not] before and try to just get my money. (P4)Many participants were attuned to the financial incentives for brands targeting queer customers. They found this motive oppor-tunistic and profit-seeking, describing it as undermining the value of representation: “They’re all trying to get me to buy things, that’swhat their end goal is, because capitalism. So I feel like that’s a root of problematic advertising, is that they don’t really care about the impact, they just want you to buy” (P3). In the context of trans-gender representation, P18 expressed that increased inclusion feltshallow and performative: “[Many organizations are] jumping on the bandwagon, and when it actually comes down to support trans rights, they’re not there” (P18). Several participants reported that this kind of opportunistic rep-resentation, which they described as tokenizing, insincere, or pink-washing, was especially common during Pride Month, even from brands and organizations that otherwise did not otherwise make an effort to include queer customers among their customer base: “During Pride Month in New York, where there were a lot of ads Ifelt didn’t really target me correctly—they were just like, here’s the corporation, we put a rainbow logo on it” (P5).4.2.4 Queer people suffer emotional harms due to ad targeting.I think it’s the ads that are creating unrealistic image of our community and of ourselves. (P8)As described in 4.1, participants found themselves targeted with some content that was obviously damaging, including ads for al-cohol (given that members of the LGBTQ+ community are dispro-portionately likely to suffer from substance abuse issues [50]), and those for weight loss (P3: “I would say, yeah, probably more so when I was younger than now, but still I would say [weight loss ads] probably do impact my body image issues”).Participants, especially (but not exclusively) those identifying as trans and non-binary, frequently reported feeling misgendered by their targeted ads. Misgendering—when the gendered elements of language used or the underlying inferences made about someone are incongruent with an individual’s gender identity—is a form of harm commonly experienced by transgender people, though it can occur to others as well [42]. One non-binary participant (who doesn't identify as a woman) described feeling misgendered by their ads:“I feel the misrepresentation the most when it has to do with babies,and I feel like those ads are always very gendered, very targeted towards women and society’s idea of [what] a mother or a womanist. [Those] ads make me feel very weird” (P2). Explaining the impact this has on their self-image, they said, “When I see ads, especially marriage- and pregnancy-related ads that are targeted towards women, it does make [me] feel like, oh no, is this how people[in real life] see me, if this is what my browsing data indicates?”(P2). A cisgender gay male participant also reported receiving ads targeted to women, and that this made him question his identity for a time: “I did struggle a lot with my gender identity for a while because when you’re constantly getting ... ads targeted for a female,I was like, how do I identify? [...] I think it does create a lot of confusion” (P1). This feeling of confusion was also echoed by anon-binary participant who reported that the oscillating gender essentialist extremes in their ads led them to conclude that these systems found their identity “confusing.” They explained, “For some reason I get a lot of ads related to pregnancy or having children.On the other end of the spectrum, I get a lot of ads for jocks straps,which I don’t really understand. But I think [the system is] very confused about what my gender is” (P18).In addition to these direct harms, participants also expressed experiencing more nebulous harm caused by ads acting as a reminder of power and privilege in society at large. As P12 thoughtfully put it, “If [ad targeting] took into account [queer] identities, I would feel like at least I’m recognized in society. But if they do not ... I[am reminded that] I’m left out, that many people do not accept me as who I am” (P12). In addition to understanding participants’ criticisms of ad targeting content and systems, we were interested in hearing their generative perspectives—changes they felt could improve their experiences with targeted ads. Proposed shifts included more diverse ad content,more transparency about the ad targeting process, more autonomy in the use and collection of people’s personal data, and the ability to forgo targeted advertising in its current form entirely.4.3.1 Queer people want more diversity in ad content.It has to be actually really nuanced and critical, it can't just be representation for the sake of making [brands]look better on the surface. (P4)We previously discussed participants’ frustration with the preva-lence of stereotypes in the content that they encountered. A solution many identified was to increase diverse representation in ad con-tent. Participants highlighted the need for more racially diverse depictions of queer people, and for more body diversity in general. P16 voiced a desire to see more “people of all different appearances and sizes and races and presentations. A lot of times people like myself—thin, white, [female-assigned] people ... are the kind of[non-binary] people getting attention in the media.”Even the participants most skeptical of targeted advertising impact on queer communities acknowledged the value that rep-resentation holds for queer people, especially for its role in the identity formation of queer youth:If there were to be more [queer] representation, I also think having [it normalize] our identities—how we look and how we identify, or who we are—having that normalized [for] someone who’s young, maybe younger than 12, [to] see this representation and feel some kind of connection to it. [...] That is monumental,and something I would advocate more for. (P15)Participants did, however, understand visibility as a double-edged sword, with the potential to impact public perceptions ofLGBTQ+ people and communities both positively and negatively—something supported by prior research in television and print ad-vertising [7, 64]. As P16 put it: “You have to watch what’s going on out there, because for some people that aren’t in the LGBT commu-nity their only exposure to queer people might be through these ads, and they might be basing their views off those ads”.Many participants noted that improved diversity should not bedone solely to improve a brand’s rapport with queer consumers.Instead, they expressed a desire for advertisers to include nuancedqueer representation in content with broad reach. To quote P2, “[Iwant] more queer people and queer relationship representation,just in mainstream ads—I feel like a lot of the queer ads I see are just for queer-specific things”. Moreover, they wanted advertisers to back up visual cues with action and not, in the words of P4, “before and try to just get my money.” P16 echoed the same sentiment,drawing on the idea of “rainbow capitalism” [13]: “I think if I go to the website and they were just using [queer imagery] to attract people and not following through—you know, rainbow capitalism—that would further turn me off from the product. But if they had marketing I felt represented in and also supported causes I believed in, I would be more likely to support them, for sure” (P16).4.3.2 Queer people want more transparency and autonomy.[It’s scary] how much we’re already monitored, and how much [ad systems] already know about me. [...] [I Would prefer] increasing the amount of diversity within advertisements, without necessarily needing to know for sure if somebody identifies a certain way. (P15)The current user experience of ad platforms leaves little room for direct user input, a power differential noted by our participants.They were highly critical of the inference and categorization done by these systems and the lack of room for self-determination. They Suggested alternatives, including greater transparency about how they were being targeted, the ability to express boundaries or dis-content with certain ad content, and control over which advertisers could bid for their attention. For example, P1 began, “I wish [ads]in general communicated why they’re showing an ad to you” andalso described wanting “autonomy over whether or not I want to disclose a certain part of my identity on my own terms ... rather than just being tracked” (P1).P6 picked up this theme, describing unease with “the sense of being watched, being tracked,” and pointing out the particular pri-vacy needs of many LGBT people that are not publicly out: “If You're not out yet, [you might] be afraid that your mom’s going tobe looking over your shoulder [while you are] scrolling throughInstagram” (P6). Other participants also mentioned concerns about security and privacy online, including P14: “I think in the globalInternet age everyone is very, very concerned about privacy and security. I don’t know what to do about that—and this is again working with the assumption that I must live with [targeted] ads. I Would rather have companies ask me [instead of inferring] ... so I Can just decline” (P14).4.3.3 Queer people imagine the ability to opt out entirely. Partic-ipants’ desire for autonomy frequently stemmed from a wish to escape ad targeting systems altogether. One participant made clear their desire to avoid ad targeting specifically, despite being com-fortable and even interested in other types of ads: “Get rid of [it]... I feel like people around me don’t shop based on seeing what-ever is available in ads. [Instead they] buy things because they become popular, or [when] a curator”—a “real person, influencer or otherwise”—“promotes an item” (P10). When asked what she would change about ads if she could change anything, P11 also said, “I Would probably get rid of it. If you gave me a magic wand that can change anything about online advertising, I wouldn’t have online advertising” (P11).",1713-17,"Participants highlighted the need for more racially diverse depictions of queer people, and for more body diversity in general."
40,Advertisements,reflectsPrecept,NoRoomForUserInput,"We conducted 18 semi-structured interviews over Zoom lasting between 30 and 45 minutes, which were recorded for transcription and analysis. Participants received a written consent form before the interviews and were compensated with a $15 Amazon gift card distributed via email afterward. Participants in this paper are identified by unique anonymous identifiers (P1 - P18) to maintain their privacy. Our study was reviewed and approved by the StanfordUniversity Institutional Review Board.In the interviews, we asked about participants’ experiences with online advertising in three parts: first asking questions about their experiences overall with online ads, second asking them to reflect on ad targeting and its relationship to various aspects of their iden-tities, and third relating to their identity as an LGBTQ+ person. The Complete interview guide is listed in Appendix A. At the close of the interview, we asked participants open-ended demographic ques-tions, having them provide any or all of the following in their own words: age, gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity, and nationality.Part 1: Online advertising. We asked participants which platforms they were most active on, how frequently they encountered ads on those platforms, and what types of advertising they encountered.We also sought to understand how and why participants engaged with ads they considered compelling, asking participants to recall an ad they had recently interacted with and reflect on the charac-teristics, including aspects of the images or text, that drew their attention.Part 2: Ad targeting. Next, to understand participants’ beliefs about what inferences ad platforms may be making and how they believe such inferences are made, we asked them to reflect on the kinds of themes, people, and other imagery they usually see in their targeted ads, and speculate as to why they receive such content. Wealso explored the relationship of this content with multiple aspects of their identities, asking about feelings of mis/representation and whether or not they wanted these identity aspects to be represented and/or inferred by ad targeting systems.Part 3: Targeted ads and LGBTQ+ identity. In our final set of interview questions, we explored participants’ perceptions of pos-itive and negative impacts on LGBTQ+ people and communities.In relation to negative impacts, we asked further questions about participants' knowledge and use of strategies for avoiding ad tar-geting, as well as what they would like to see changed (including more realistic and more speculative ideas). Though extant theoretical frameworks shaped our inquiries in this work, our goal was to let the patterns of our data guide our anal-ysis, so we chose a reflexive approach [11]. Initially, one author conducted line-by-line open coding of all transcripts to develop a codebook of keywords and sub-keywords. Using this codebook,another author took a second pass, coding the transcripts a second time and updating, replacing, or adding additional keywords as needed. The first coding pass was conducted using NVivo qual-itative analysis software, while the second was conducted usingDelve for better collaboration. After collaborative discussions of the coded content, these two authors came to a consensus about the final set of codes and coded content. Examples of codes included: “binary gender norms”, “control/autonomy”, “lacking nuance”, and“feels creepy”.Themes were collaboratively synthesized based on the most prevalent codes, developed narratively, and divided into three major sets of insights pertaining to participants’ views on ad content, ad targeting as it currently exists, and ideals and alternatives they envisioned. We re-referenced the interview transcripts to refine and finalize themes, ensuring they emerged as directly as possible from our data. This study involves data collection with LGBTQ+ individuals, a group that has specific privacy and safety concerns. This is espe-cially true given the range of risks faced by some queer people due to their nationalities (homosexuality is still criminalized in some countries [57]), gender identities (transgender people, especially transfeminine people of color, face a disproportionate risk of vio-lence [22]), and other attributes. We, the research team, took care of our recruitment, data collection, and analysis to retain their con-fidentiality, including not requiring participants to provide their legal names, compensating them using gift cards not attached to their legal identities, and ensuring that only the research team had access to the transcripts and recordings. Additionally, we acknowl-edge the tensions and risks inherent to conducting research focused on marginalized communities and individuals [40]. Our resulting analysis is not only shaped by a theoretical grounding in queer and feminist theory, but each author’s individual experiences as a per-son marginalized along the axes of gender, race, sexuality, ethnicity,and other identities (with overlaps and privileges therein). We divide our findings regarding ad content into three main points:the overarching lack of representations of queerness, stereotypical-ity when such identities were seen in ads, and the particular lack of representation faced by those with multiple marginalized identities.4.1.1 Participants’ ads reflect heterosexual societal norms. Although participants did widely report receiving ads targeted to them that depicted queer people, across the board they reported that many or most of the ads they saw were instead reflective of dominant hetero-sexual societal norms. P5 summarized, “I think there is starting to become change, but I see a lot of ... stereotypically, traditionally beau-tiful [people in ads] who are tall, or thin, or white, or able-bodied,etc.” (P5). This was echoed by other participants; P16 described the people they saw as being “generally either thin white men or thin white women. Generally attractive people” (P16). Another, despite seeing some ads geared towards queer people, noted that “most of the ads I see I typically feature straight couples” (P2). This aligns with prior work about ads’ reflections of dominant culture [60].4.1.2 Representations of queerness perpetuate stereotypes. The overall lack of queer representation was exacerbated by the heavy pres-ence of stereotypes in targeted ads seemingly intended to interestqueer consumers. In line with Kates [36]’s assessment that advertis-ing as an activity reflects dominant discourses, P1 described feeling caricatured: “It’s like the stereotype of what a gay man is ... like super dramatized, a point where I’m like, I don’t know anybody who acts like that. [...] I don’t know who’s relating to that; it’s [how]straight people think gay people act” (P1).More specifically, participants mentioned seeing stereotypes relating queerness to promiscuity and substance use. P6 describe some of the ads they saw as “hypersexualized”: “The advertisements are all, like, nightclub lighting, like all of these hot 32-year-old with basically all their clothes off, dancing and making out with each other” (P6). They clarified, “I don’t think that’s bad, it looks like they’re having a great time, but it’s really weird. I’m not sure if I consider it offensive or not.” Another described the ads they saw representing queer people as “pertaining to drinking, like fo rbeers” (P15). Unfortunately, this is nothing new; as prior literature has recorded, and some of our older participants remembered, such stereotypes reflect historical patterns in advertising [60]. P13 (age41) noted, “It used to be [that] alcohol and cigarettes were the only companies [with] gay [representation in] ads, so that felt a little stigmatizing” (P13).Other participants also felt misrepresented by content that, de-spite featuring appropriate representations of queerness, did not align with their own personal queer identities.

Consistent with prior work [23], our participants considered this problematic: “I’m a fat person ... I’m part of a lot of groups for other fat people. I think a lot of ads show me weight loss [content]because they assume that ... I want to lose weight, so that’s one thing they get wrong” (P3). Another participant reported that their ads overlook “disability or chronic illness—I have some chronic illnesses and friends who do as well, and it can be hard to see ads that don’t represent your queer friend group” (P5).

P16 voiced a desire to see more “people of all different appearances and sizes and races and presentations. A lot of times people like myself—thin, white, [female-assigned] people ... are the kind of[non-binary] people getting attention in the media.”Even the participants most skeptical of targeted advertising impact on queer communities acknowledged the value that rep-resentation holds for queer people, especially for its role in the identity formation of queer youth:If there were to be more [queer] representation, I also think having [it normalize] our identities—how we look and how we identify, or who we are—having that normalized [for] someone who’s young, maybe younger than 12, [to] see this representation and feel some kind of connection to it. [...] That is monumental,and something I would advocate more for. (P15)Participants did, however, understand visibility as a double-edged sword, with the potential to impact public perceptions ofLGBTQ+ people and communities both positively and negatively—something supported by prior research in television and print ad-vertising [7, 64]. As P16 put it: “You have to watch what’s going on out there, because for some people that aren’t in the LGBT commu-nity their only exposure to queer people might be through these ads, and they might be basing their views off those ads”.Many participants noted that improved diversity should not bedone solely to improve a brand’s rapport with queer consumers.Instead, they expressed a desire for advertisers to include nuancedqueer representation in content with broad reach. To quote P2, “[Iwant] more queer people and queer relationship representation,just in mainstream ads—I feel like a lot of the queer ads I see are just for queer-specific things”. Moreover, they wanted advertisers to back up visual cues with action and not, in the words of P4, “before and try to just get my money.” P16 echoed the same sentiment,drawing on the idea of “rainbow capitalism” [13]: “I think if I go to the website and they were just using [queer imagery] to attract people and not following through—you know, rainbow capitalism—that would further turn me off from the product. But if they had marketing I felt represented in and also supported causes I believed in, I would be more likely to support them, for sure” (P16).4.3.2 Queer people want more transparency and autonomy.[It’s scary] how much we’re already monitored, and how much [ad systems] already know about me. [...] [I Would prefer] increasing the amount of diversity within advertisements, without necessarily needing to know for sure if somebody identifies a certain way. (P15)The current user experience of ad platforms leaves little room for direct user input, a power differential noted by our participants.They were highly critical of the inference and categorization done by these systems and the lack of room for self-determination. They Suggested alternatives, including greater transparency about how they were being targeted, the ability to express boundaries or dis-content with certain ad content, and control over which advertisers could bid for their attention. For example, P1 began, “I wish [ads]in general communicated why they’re showing an ad to you” andalso described wanting “autonomy over whether or not I want to disclose a certain part of my identity on my own terms ... rather than just being tracked” (P1).P6 picked up this theme, describing unease with “the sense of being watched, being tracked,” and pointing out the particular pri-vacy needs of many LGBT people that are not publicly out: “If You're not out yet, [you might] be afraid that your mom’s going tobe looking over your shoulder [while you are] scrolling throughInstagram” (P6). Other participants also mentioned concerns about security and privacy online, including P14: “I think in the globalInternet age everyone is very, very concerned about privacy and security. I don’t know what to do about that—and this is again working with the assumption that I must live with [targeted] ads. I Would rather have companies ask me [instead of inferring] ... so I Can just decline” (P14).4.3.3 Queer people imagine the ability to opt out entirely. Partic-ipants’ desire for autonomy frequently stemmed from a wish to escape ad targeting systems altogether. One participant made clear their desire to avoid ad targeting specifically, despite being com-fortable and even interested in other types of ads: “Get rid of [it]... I feel like people around me don’t shop based on seeing what-ever is available in ads. [Instead they] buy things because they become popular, or [when] a curator”—a “real person, influencer or otherwise”—“promotes an item” (P10). When asked what she would change about ads if she could change anything, P11 also said, “I Would probably get rid of it. If you gave me a magic wand that can change anything about online advertising, I wouldn’t have online advertising” (P11).",1713-17,"The current user experience of ad platforms leaves little room for direct user input, a power differential noted by our participants"
41,PrivacyNeeds,constrainsAgent,LGBTQParticipants,"We conducted 18 semi-structured interviews over Zoom lasting between 30 and 45 minutes, which were recorded for transcription and analysis. Participants received a written consent form before the interviews and were compensated with a $15 Amazon gift card distributed via email afterward. Participants in this paper are identified by unique anonymous identifiers (P1 - P18) to maintain their privacy. Our study was reviewed and approved by the StanfordUniversity Institutional Review Board.In the interviews, we asked about participants’ experiences with online advertising in three parts: first asking questions about their experiences overall with online ads, second asking them to reflect on ad targeting and its relationship to various aspects of their iden-tities, and third relating to their identity as an LGBTQ+ person. The Complete interview guide is listed in Appendix A. At the close of the interview, we asked participants open-ended demographic ques-tions, having them provide any or all of the following in their own words: age, gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity, and nationality.Part 1: Online advertising. We asked participants which platforms they were most active on, how frequently they encountered ads on those platforms, and what types of advertising they encountered.We also sought to understand how and why participants engaged with ads they considered compelling, asking participants to recall an ad they had recently interacted with and reflect on the charac-teristics, including aspects of the images or text, that drew their attention.Part 2: Ad targeting. Next, to understand participants’ beliefs about what inferences ad platforms may be making and how they believe such inferences are made, we asked them to reflect on the kinds of themes, people, and other imagery they usually see in their targeted ads, and speculate as to why they receive such content. Wealso explored the relationship of this content with multiple aspects of their identities, asking about feelings of mis/representation and whether or not they wanted these identity aspects to be represented and/or inferred by ad targeting systems.Part 3: Targeted ads and LGBTQ+ identity. In our final set of interview questions, we explored participants’ perceptions of pos-itive and negative impacts on LGBTQ+ people and communities.In relation to negative impacts, we asked further questions about participants' knowledge and use of strategies for avoiding ad tar-geting, as well as what they would like to see changed (including more realistic and more speculative ideas). Though extant theoretical frameworks shaped our inquiries in this work, our goal was to let the patterns of our data guide our anal-ysis, so we chose a reflexive approach [11]. Initially, one author conducted line-by-line open coding of all transcripts to develop a codebook of keywords and sub-keywords. Using this codebook,another author took a second pass, coding the transcripts a second time and updating, replacing, or adding additional keywords as needed. The first coding pass was conducted using NVivo qual-itative analysis software, while the second was conducted usingDelve for better collaboration. After collaborative discussions of the coded content, these two authors came to a consensus about the final set of codes and coded content. Examples of codes included: “binary gender norms”, “control/autonomy”, “lacking nuance”, and“feels creepy”.Themes were collaboratively synthesized based on the most prevalent codes, developed narratively, and divided into three major sets of insights pertaining to participants’ views on ad content, ad targeting as it currently exists, and ideals and alternatives they envisioned. We re-referenced the interview transcripts to refine and finalize themes, ensuring they emerged as directly as possible from our data. This study involves data collection with LGBTQ+ individuals, a group that has specific privacy and safety concerns. This is espe-cially true given the range of risks faced by some queer people due to their nationalities (homosexuality is still criminalized in some countries [57]), gender identities (transgender people, especially transfeminine people of color, face a disproportionate risk of vio-lence [22]), and other attributes. We, the research team, took care of our recruitment, data collection, and analysis to retain their con-fidentiality, including not requiring participants to provide their legal names, compensating them using gift cards not attached to their legal identities, and ensuring that only the research team had access to the transcripts and recordings. Additionally, we acknowl-edge the tensions and risks inherent to conducting research focused on marginalized communities and individuals [40]. Our resulting analysis is not only shaped by a theoretical grounding in queer and feminist theory, but each author’s individual experiences as a per-son marginalized along the axes of gender, race, sexuality, ethnicity,and other identities (with overlaps and privileges therein). We divide our findings regarding ad content into three main points:the overarching lack of representations of queerness, stereotypical-ity when such identities were seen in ads, and the particular lack of representation faced by those with multiple marginalized identities.4.1.1 Participants’ ads reflect heterosexual societal norms. Although participants did widely report receiving ads targeted to them that depicted queer people, across the board they reported that many or most of the ads they saw were instead reflective of dominant hetero-sexual societal norms. P5 summarized, “I think there is starting to become change, but I see a lot of ... stereotypically, traditionally beau-tiful [people in ads] who are tall, or thin, or white, or able-bodied,etc.” (P5). This was echoed by other participants; P16 described the people they saw as being “generally either thin white men or thin white women. Generally attractive people” (P16). Another, despite seeing some ads geared towards queer people, noted that “most of the ads I see I typically feature straight couples” (P2). This aligns with prior work about ads’ reflections of dominant culture [60].4.1.2 Representations of queerness perpetuate stereotypes. The overall lack of queer representation was exacerbated by the heavy pres-ence of stereotypes in targeted ads seemingly intended to interestqueer consumers. In line with Kates [36]’s assessment that advertis-ing as an activity reflects dominant discourses, P1 described feeling caricatured: “It’s like the stereotype of what a gay man is ... like super dramatized, a point where I’m like, I don’t know anybody who acts like that. [...] I don’t know who’s relating to that; it’s [how]straight people think gay people act” (P1).More specifically, participants mentioned seeing stereotypes relating queerness to promiscuity and substance use. P6 describe some of the ads they saw as “hypersexualized”: “The advertisements are all, like, nightclub lighting, like all of these hot 32-year-old with basically all their clothes off, dancing and making out with each other” (P6). They clarified, “I don’t think that’s bad, it looks like they’re having a great time, but it’s really weird. I’m not sure if I consider it offensive or not.” Another described the ads they saw representing queer people as “pertaining to drinking, like fo rbeers” (P15). Unfortunately, this is nothing new; as prior literature has recorded, and some of our older participants remembered, such stereotypes reflect historical patterns in advertising [60]. P13 (age41) noted, “It used to be [that] alcohol and cigarettes were the only companies [with] gay [representation in] ads, so that felt a little stigmatizing” (P13).Other participants also felt misrepresented by content that, de-spite featuring appropriate representations of queerness, did not align with their own personal queer identities. For instance, a high-femme lesbian participant pointed out that the queer-targeted ads she received made “incorrect assumptions” about her gender presentation: “While I am gay, that does not immediately imply that Iwant to dress androgynously” (P11).4.1.3 Lack of diversity especially impacts those with intersecting identities. The lack of diversity in ad content was especially notice-able for those holding multiple marginalized identities, including participants of color; trans, non-binary, and gender-nonconforming participants; those with disabilities; and fat participants. A majority of participants observed a lack of racial diversity in their targeted ads; both white and non-white participants had their targeted advertisements dominated by depictions of white people. P1, a gay Iraqi man, described his targeted ads as being centered on white Western lifestyles and perspectives, sharing,“Any identities outside of that are super hard to see, or they're super exaggerated” (P1). This was one of the most widely-reported themes; 14 out of 18 participants mentioned the overwhelming whiteness in their ads. Gender-nonconforming participants noted that even when systems accurately determined their gender identities, their targeted ads reflected heteropatriarchy assumptions about their experi-ences. P6, a non-binary lesbian, reflected on the inadequacy of the lesbian representation they saw in ads: “Where there’s a lesbian cou-ple, usually both women are white and very feminine [with] longhair—I don’t really think we’ll ever see that much butch [represen-tation] because of the way our culture constructs what a beautiful woman looks like” (P6). A non-binary participant reported, “I feel like [my ads] are targeted more towards trans men, or someonewho’s more masculine than I am” (P2). Participants also cited a lack of body diversity in the models they saw, in particular a lack of depictions of fatness and disability. Consistent with prior work [23], our participants considered this problematic: “I’m a fat person ... I’m part of a lot of groups for other fat people. I think a lot of ads show me weight loss [content]because they assume that ... I want to lose weight, so that’s one thing they get wrong” (P3). Another participant reported that their ads overlook “disability or chronic illness—I have some chronic illnesses and friends who do as well, and it can be hard to see ads that don’t represent your queer friend group” (P5). Aside from their concerns about ad content, all participants reflected some degree of awareness and discomfort with ad target-ing systems identifying them as queer, a type of inference they were easily able to identify: “[Unlike ads for straight people,] you can really tell the ad targeting is for queer people; [advertisers]make it so obvious” (P18). Their responses to these inference- and categorization-based systems’ treatment ranged from mild discom-fort to experiences of significant emotional harm.4.2.1 Ad targeting made participants feel unsettled and unsafe.While participants expressed frustration with targeted advertis-ing that missed the mark, they shared that that accurate targeting often felt “creepy” (P8), “disconcerting” (P13), and even “scary” (P3).Creepiness, in particular, was a recurring theme. P3 reported feeling torn between the desire for convenience and this creepiness: “I get kind of creeped out when [ad systems] seem like they know a lot of things about my life and my interests. [...] From convenience sake,I’ll be more likely to see things that I’d be interested in ... but then,on the other hand, I don’t like advertisements and how all these places are collecting personal data about me” (P3).Taking the same perspective from the opposite direction, P4described that misrepresentative content sometimes felt reassur-ing, in that the ad targeting system “doesn’t really know me” (P4).Feeling “seen” by targeted ad systems frequently felt as much like surveillance as inclusion. In the United Sates, where most majora's platforms are based, legal protection of queer identities is based on the right to privacy [30]; it is unsurprising, then, that queerpeople’s privacy concerns are highly specific, and connected to their larger concerns about their civil rights. P11, a lesbian transwoman who expressed a desire for ads more relevant to her transidentity, expressed simultaneous concern: “I just don’t love the idea that the internet sees me for me, because that’s kind of danger-ous sometimes. There are state legislatures and whole countries that have passed laws to try to make it difficult, if not straight-up impossible, for me to live” (P11).4.2.2 Participants made sense of ad targeting and its failures. Partic-ipants had many plausible hypotheses for the mechanisms behind their targeted ads, including their own behaviors (P18: “I like to do creative writing so I go to baby name websites to look for names for characters, and ... the ads might be thinking, oh this person is pregnant because they’re looking up baby names”), and advertisers lacking nuanced understandings of queerness (P1, a gay middle eastern man, described many of his ads as “completely alienating to other members of the community [besides white gay men]”).Another common explanation participants pointed to was the advertising industry itself. P14 described white-centric ad content as being reflective of “the nature of the advertising business”, as well as broader social norms: “A lot of the ads showcase white gay male models—cisgender, white models—which, I mean, that’s obviously problematic, but it’s also a reflection of kind of the hegemonic discourse that is almost always in queer spaces, right? Unless you’rein a particularly non-white space.” (P14)4.2.3 Corporate tokenization of queerness contributes to skepticism. I don’t want them to market toward me—like, I don't think that companies can have a genuine care about communities that I’m part of, so I’d rather they [not] before and try to just get my money. (P4)Many participants were attuned to the financial incentives for brands targeting queer customers. They found this motive oppor-tunistic and profit-seeking, describing it as undermining the value of representation: “They’re all trying to get me to buy things, that’swhat their end goal is, because capitalism. So I feel like that’s a root of problematic advertising, is that they don’t really care about the impact, they just want you to buy” (P3). In the context of trans-gender representation, P18 expressed that increased inclusion feltshallow and performative: “[Many organizations are] jumping on the bandwagon, and when it actually comes down to support trans rights, they’re not there” (P18). Several participants reported that this kind of opportunistic rep-resentation, which they described as tokenizing, insincere, or pink-washing, was especially common during Pride Month, even from brands and organizations that otherwise did not otherwise make an effort to include queer customers among their customer base: “During Pride Month in New York, where there were a lot of ads Ifelt didn’t really target me correctly—they were just like, here’s the corporation, we put a rainbow logo on it” (P5).4.2.4 Queer people suffer emotional harms due to ad targeting.I think it’s the ads that are creating unrealistic image of our community and of ourselves. (P8)As described in 4.1, participants found themselves targeted with some content that was obviously damaging, including ads for al-cohol (given that members of the LGBTQ+ community are dispro-portionately likely to suffer from substance abuse issues [50]), and those for weight loss (P3: “I would say, yeah, probably more so when I was younger than now, but still I would say [weight loss ads] probably do impact my body image issues”).Participants, especially (but not exclusively) those identifying as trans and non-binary, frequently reported feeling misgendered by their targeted ads. Misgendering—when the gendered elements of language used or the underlying inferences made about someone are incongruent with an individual’s gender identity—is a form of harm commonly experienced by transgender people, though it can occur to others as well [42]. One non-binary participant (who doesn't identify as a woman) described feeling misgendered by their ads:“I feel the misrepresentation the most when it has to do with babies,and I feel like those ads are always very gendered, very targeted towards women and society’s idea of [what] a mother or a womanist. [Those] ads make me feel very weird” (P2). Explaining the impact this has on their self-image, they said, “When I see ads, especially marriage- and pregnancy-related ads that are targeted towards women, it does make [me] feel like, oh no, is this how people[in real life] see me, if this is what my browsing data indicates?”(P2). A cisgender gay male participant also reported receiving ads targeted to women, and that this made him question his identity for a time: “I did struggle a lot with my gender identity for a while because when you’re constantly getting ... ads targeted for a female,I was like, how do I identify? [...] I think it does create a lot of confusion” (P1). This feeling of confusion was also echoed by anon-binary participant who reported that the oscillating gender essentialist extremes in their ads led them to conclude that these systems found their identity “confusing.” They explained, “For some reason I get a lot of ads related to pregnancy or having children.On the other end of the spectrum, I get a lot of ads for jocks straps,which I don’t really understand. But I think [the system is] very confused about what my gender is” (P18).In addition to these direct harms, participants also expressed experiencing more nebulous harm caused by ads acting as a reminder of power and privilege in society at large. As P12 thoughtfully put it, “If [ad targeting] took into account [queer] identities, I would feel like at least I’m recognized in society. But if they do not ... I[am reminded that] I’m left out, that many people do not accept me as who I am” (P12). In addition to understanding participants’ criticisms of ad targeting content and systems, we were interested in hearing their generative perspectives—changes they felt could improve their experiences with targeted ads. Proposed shifts included more diverse ad content,more transparency about the ad targeting process, more autonomy in the use and collection of people’s personal data, and the ability to forgo targeted advertising in its current form entirely.4.3.1 Queer people want more diversity in ad content.It has to be actually really nuanced and critical, it can't just be representation for the sake of making [brands]look better on the surface. (P4)We previously discussed participants’ frustration with the preva-lence of stereotypes in the content that they encountered. A solution many identified was to increase diverse representation in ad con-tent. Participants highlighted the need for more racially diverse depictions of queer people, and for more body diversity in general. P16 voiced a desire to see more “people of all different appearances and sizes and races and presentations. A lot of times people like myself—thin, white, [female-assigned] people ... are the kind of[non-binary] people getting attention in the media.”Even the participants most skeptical of targeted advertising impact on queer communities acknowledged the value that rep-resentation holds for queer people, especially for its role in the identity formation of queer youth:If there were to be more [queer] representation, I also think having [it normalize] our identities—how we look and how we identify, or who we are—having that normalized [for] someone who’s young, maybe younger than 12, [to] see this representation and feel some kind of connection to it.
