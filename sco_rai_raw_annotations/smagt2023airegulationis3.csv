9,EU,Agent,"To address such concerns, regulatory proposals have started to emerge around the world, such as the horizontal approach adopted by the European Union (EU) for the proposal for an AI regulation (AI Act) [17], the Bills proposed by the Canadian Government [55]. Moreover, the vertical approach adopted by the Chinese government, where specific applications of AI are subject to regulatory requirements when deployed in certain contexts has been proposed, such as recommendation systems or generative AI models [59]. Whereas other governments around the world have been signaling their intent to endeavor into AI regulation, such as the Blueprint on an AI Bill of Rights, published by the White House [56]. Whilst the policy landscape around the world is rapidly evolving, the issues emerging with the deployment of AI are also increasing. This paper shows that the current governance landscape is inadequate to address all the challenges throughout the lifecycle of AI systems. Hence, regulation will not be enough. Ensuring that AI contributes to humans and the environment’s well-being will depend on many factors such as the capacity to properly regulate its deployment, but also, by mandating necessary internal best practices along its lifecycle.",1267-8,European Union,
