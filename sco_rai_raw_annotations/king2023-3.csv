9,WorriesAboutPublicPerceptionOfThreat,Perceived_Problem,"While data sharing with other agencies is cumbersome, direct data collection raises concerns that the public may respond negatively. Even if individual privacy is not substantively threatened and collection would be permitted by law, agencies worry the public may feel threatened due to unfamiliarity with existing privacy protections, a lack of awareness of the collective benefits of demographic data collection, or distrust of the data collectors. When the justification for data collection under privacy law is murky, agencies are especially likely to behave conservatively to maintain public trust.The USPTO sought public comment on a data collection proposal for bias assessment for a 2012 study on diversity among patent applicants. It found that “the ability of mandatory surveys to generate individual demographic diversity data of acceptable quality and reliability is in tension with the lack of public support for manda-tory surveys due to privacy concerns under current law” [135, p.3] One commenter noted that voluntary surveys would “reassure”respondents about their privacy [135, p.3].Although voluntary survey questions may maintain respondents sense of trust, they also pose the risk of lower response rates. USDA report on the Market Facilitation Program (MFP), a program that distributed $25 billion to farmers hurt by retaliatory tariffs in2018 and 2019, found that less than a third of recipients self-reported their race [99]. Minority groups often exhibit higher nonresponse rates for surveys in general [7, 50, 72] (though see Lee et al. 76), val-idating the USPTO’s concern that voluntary response may produce“statistical bias arising from self-selection among respondents” if the non-response is not random [135, p.3]. CMS Survey and FocusGroups document high levels of mistrust in the government and public institutions, particularly among marginalized groups, offer-ing one explanation for low response rates and suggesting disparate nonresponse bias [81]. Some have suggested offering monetary in-centives to boost response rates for government surveys, though this solution comes with its own set of problems [128].For these reasons, mandatory data collection does not appear to be a favored choice amongst agencies. As USDA moves away from using visual observation when respondents do not self-identify,it has suggested states should “encourage [participants] to self-identify and self-report” through education about the use of demographic data for bias assessment, and should find “other data sources or statistical tools to account for the times when partici-pants choose not to self-identify” [53].Mandatory data collection is seen to create risk with program participation. Tax experts, for instance, agree that adding demographic data questions to Form 1040 risks reduced tax compliance[58]. Even if tax auditors are denied access to race data, eliminating any possibility of express discrimination, interviewees concur that people may not file taxes if they perceive the government to be overreaching and potentially discriminating [58, p. 14]. Comments From a Treasury statistician suggest the need to manage public perception may affect Treasury particularly acutely; other agencies worry that even sharing data with Treasury could depress survey response rates by creating a perception that responses could be used to enforce tax compliance [115]. The effect of demographic questions on response rates to government surveys is difficult to predict and likely varies by context and demographic characteristics of interest. Based on research conducted by the Census Bureau,questions asking about sexual orientation and gender identity don’tsignificantly depress responses [112], but serious concern about the safety, security, and integrity of the Census does exist, particularly amongst racial and ethnic minority groups [81]. Finally, a 2018 study by the Census Bureau identified the proposed reintroduction of a citizenship question on the 2020 census as a “major barrier”to participation, due to the political discourse surrounding immi-gration, and fears of retaliation against specific ethnic groups by the government [140]. Multiple studies suggest that a citizenship question would induce significant non-response [65]. Other agen-cies like the Center for Medicare Services intend to explore the impact of demographic questions on non-response and program participation, but this research is not yet complete [102].Direct data collection demonstrates the challenge of public trust and privacy. Generalized distrust of the federal government, on-going concerns about government surveillance, and perhaps, lack of public awareness of federal privacy protections, especially in comparison to the private sector’s lack of privacy regulation, allpose challenges to federal agencies navigating the requirements of the EO while maintaining public trust.",499-500,"direct data collection raises concerns that the public may respond negatively.

When the justification for data collection under privacy law is murky, agencies are especially likely to behave conservatively to maintain public trust.The USPTO sought public comment on a data collection proposal for bias assessment for a 2012 study on diversity among patent applicants. It found that “the ability of mandatory surveys to generate individual demographic diversity data of acceptable quality and reliability is in tension with the lack of public support for manda-tory surveys due to privacy concerns under current law” [135, p.3] One commenter noted that voluntary surveys would “reassure”respondents about their privacy [135, p.3].Although voluntary survey questions may maintain respondents sense of trust, they also pose the risk of lower response rates. USDA report on the Market Facilitation Program (MFP), a program that distributed $25 billion to farmers hurt by retaliatory tariffs in2018 and 2019, found that less than a third of recipients self-reported their race [99].

Some have suggested offering monetary in-centives to boost response rates for government surveys, though this solution comes with its own set of problems [128].For these reasons, mandatory data collection does not appear to be a favored choice amongst agencies. As USDA moves away from using visual observation when respondents do not self-identify,it has suggested states should “encourage [participants] to self-identify and self-report” through education about the use of demographic data for bias assessment, and should find “other data sources or statistical tools to account for the times when partici-pants choose not to self-identify” [53].Mandatory data collection is seen to create risk with program participation. Tax experts, for instance, agree that adding demographic data questions to Form 1040 risks reduced tax compliance[58].

Even if tax auditors are denied access to race data, eliminating any possibility of express discrimination, interviewees concur that people may not file taxes if they perceive the government to be overreaching and potentially discriminating [58, p. 14]. Comments From a Treasury statistician suggest the need to manage public perception may affect Treasury particularly acutely; other agencies worry that even sharing data with Treasury could depress survey response rates by creating a perception that responses could be used to enforce tax compliance [115]. The effect of demographic questions on response rates to government surveys is difficult to predict and likely varies by context and demographic characteristics of interest. Based on research conducted by the Census Bureau,questions asking about sexual orientation and gender identity don’tsignificantly depress responses [112], but serious concern about the safety, security, and integrity of the Census does exist, particularly amongst racial and ethnic minority groups [81]. Finally, a 2018 study by the Census Bureau identified the proposed reintroduction of a citizenship question on the 2020 census as a “major barrier”to participation, due to the political discourse surrounding immi-gration, and fears of retaliation against specific ethnic groups by the government [140]. Multiple studies suggest that a citizenship question would induce significant non-response [65]. Other agen-cies like the Center for Medicare Services intend to explore the impact of demographic questions on non-response and program participation, but this research is not yet complete [102].Direct data collection demonstrates the challenge of public trust and privacy. Generalized distrust of the federal government, on-going concerns about government surveillance, and perhaps, lack of public awareness of federal privacy protections, especially in comparison to the private sector’s lack of privacy regulation, allpose challenges to federal agencies navigating the requirements of the EO while maintaining public trust.",499-500,"a 2018 study by the Census Bureau identified the proposed reintroduction of a citizenship question on the 2020 census as a “major barrier”to participation, due to the political discourse surrounding immi-gration, and fears of retaliation against specific ethnic groups by the government"
