9,OpenLicenses,Artifact,"Open software licenses can be conceived as social institutions setting the norms in specific communities and/or markets, see [82]. The license plays a core role, it carries specifications from the licensor - e.g., an individual, or a company - on how the licensed material can be used. Thus, the license is a carrier of norms to respect by the public when using the licensed material. Over time, open software licenses, such as open-source licenses, have become a licensing standard among scientific communities and companies. These are nowadays massively adopted and have been standardized as social institutions governing the economic interactions between market actors. Each license represents a particular set of economic interests transposed into a very specific set of clauses. For instance, when stakeholders release source code with a GPL2 license, they want the public to benefit from their innovation while requiring the public to share under the same terms their incremental innovation. In other words, the community gives you and you give back to the community, a social trade-off. On the other end of the spectrum, when stakeholders release source code under the MIT license, they are willing to share their innovation with the public enabling it to do whatever it wants with the licensed material. The only thing the licensor asks in return is to include a copyright notice and a permission notice.Licenses like GPL2 and MIT have become the de facto standard way of sharing software-related material in the Information andCommunications Technologies (ICT) industry. Corollary to it, the messages conveyed by each license have transcended as community norms, as behavioral standards which, despite the specific legal terms present in the license, are widely understood and respected by most market actors. Consequently, it seems probable that when software developers choose a GPL license to release their code, they consider the GPL license as a set of values part of the software-sharing community that has to be respected. Thedeveloper chooses the license due to the message it conveys to the public, as a community norm and value carrier Taking a similar value-based and community approach, Open And Responsible AI Licenses (OpenRAIL [18]) are AI-specific li-censes allowing open access to the licensed AI material while set-ting restrictions on its use [59] [17] [33]. These type of licenses seek to tackle (i) growing concerns about the open distribution and use of ML models via open-source or creative commons licenses [82];and (ii), legal uncertainty on how to design specific contractual tools for AI features [7]. Open & Responsible AI licenses are also conceived and designed as value carriers. OpenRAILs were designed to include specific provisions enabling widespread adoption of the informed use restrictions embedded in the genesis license. These Provisions require subsequent re-distributions of the licensed MLartifact or distributions of derivatives of it to include - at minimum- the same use restrictions. As a result, the set of informed restrictions, stemming from licensor's concerns and technical understanding of their artifacts capabilities and limitations, are passed on from user to user, from license to license, all the way down the value chain. In the long run, this set of informed use restrictions aims to become a well-established community norm in the AI space, so users may know what values they have to respect when using an ML artifact licensed under a RAIL or OpenRAIL license. The goal is not to harmonize values but rather to standardize how ethical concerns tied to the technical capabilities and limitations of ML artifacts can inform the open licensing of ML artifacts, in order to foster new community norms around the respect of the licensed artifact by means of use-based restrictions acting as informed value carriers.Examples of RAIL licenses include BigScience OpenRAIL-M [6],SIL AI RAIL-M [32], and the new BigCode OpenRAIL-M [31]. Thelatter also promotes AI documentation across the value chain by requiring users to retain the original model card of the model when sharing it, or, when sharing a modified version of the model (e.g. a fine tuned version) also share a model card with same or better qual-ity than the original one and documenting the modifications made to the original model (see paragraph 5.2(b) of the license agreement).AI documentation requirements embedded in contractual clauses are well aligned with upcoming regulatory requirements for AIsystems under the EU AI Act, as pointed out in the next subsection.",350-1,Open software licenses ,
