9,XboxUsers,Agent,"To illustrate how we examine the consistent conceptualization of labels, we present a case study of video game labels. Game la-bels are not only pertinent for understanding the landscape of the video game industry (forecasted to grow by 50% over the next five years [17]), but also lead to better user experiences on gaming plat-forms [2]. Appropriate game labels allow for more direct searches,and can feed into more accurate recommendation systems for users.We conducted a large-scale survey in the Xbox gaming ecosystem wherein respondents annotated different games using given labels(e.g., “Is [game] an action game?”). Our analysis reveals that we can identify inconsistently conceptualized labels across countries, and we use one such label as a running example throughout the case study. We then present two explanations for why certain labels are inconsistently conceptualized, based on (1) cultural differences and (2) translation differences. Finally, we show that label predic-tions can be improved if trained on a dataset of a heterogeneous global population of annotators rather than a small homogeneous population from a single country.3.1 DataOur analysis is based on an email survey conducted in May-June2022 targeting Xbox gamers. The survey was run in 16 countries:Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Brazil, Germany, Greece, Japan,Poland, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, India, Nigeria, Singapore, SouthAfrica, and the United States. These countries were selected to provide coverage of all distinct regions in the Inglehart–Welzel Cultural Map [35].The survey first allowed the respondent to select which of 11 popular video games they had played in the past year. Then, for the games the respondent selected, they were asked to annotate the game using any of 28 labels presented (such as “action”, “cozy”,etc.). We also collected respondent demographic information such as age, gender, gaming frequency, and gaming device.For respondents in countries where English is not an official lan-guage, the entire survey text was translated to their local language.1 In this process, we performed translation and back-translation by native speakers to ensure translation consistency across lan-guages [8]. We additionally recruited a smaller sample of globalXbox Ambassadors [84]—individuals who are known to be bilingual and opt-in to additional communications from Xbox—to respond to the survey in English; the Xbox Ambassadors were primarily based in the US, Brazil, German, Mexico, and Poland. To summa-rize, all individuals with IP addresses in India, Nigeria, Singapore,South Africa, and the US were served only surveys in English; indi-viduals in all other countries were served surveys either in their local language or—if they are an Xbox Ambassador known to bebilingual—English.In total, we received 5,174 survey responses with complete demo-graphic information; the dominant respondent demographic wasUS-based men in the 25-44 age range, which is reflective of both the demographics of individuals who opt in to receive emails fromXbox, and the selection bias arising from individuals who choose to proactively fill out the survey for no reward. We explore and statistically correct for the respondents’ demographic skew relative to overall gamer populations in subsection 3.2. We begin by examining game labels that are inconsistently concep-tualized across different demographic groups, and to what extent.To do so, we perform multilevel regression and poststratification(MRP) [51, 80] to address the imbalanced nature of our dataset. Wefirst run a Bayesian logistic regression using survey respondents demographic attributes as covariates to generate a distribution of predictions for whether or not a certain label would be anno-tated for each game. Then, the ensuing predictions are weighted via post-stratification to resemble the known joint distribution of age, gender, and country demographics for Xbox players writ large.2 In doing so, our post-stratified estimates of label selection are more accurate over subgroups [62]—specifically, upweighting respondents with smaller sample sizes such as female or non-USrespondents [41, 80]. Note that for the ensuing analyses, we remove respondents from India and Saudi Arabia, as well as non-binary in-dividuals, due to recruiting only 1 or fewer respondents answering the survey for multiple games; however, we comment on extensions of our model to these subgroups in subsection 3.4. We similarly exclude anonymized Game 11 from our analysis due to low survey response rates detailed in Appendix A.As a running example, in Figure 2 we show the post-stratified predictions of the “high replayability” label for each demographic subgroup regarding a certain popular action game (anonymized in this paper). We consider the “high replayability” label for this game to be inconsistently conceptualized per the green line in Figure 2:our model estimates less than a 39% probability that gender- and age-representative Korean gamers would consider the game to be highly replayable; in a majority vote among Koreans, this game would not be given the “high replayability” label. In contrast, we estimate a 59%probability that gender- and age-representative American gamers would consider the game to be highly replayable; in a majority vote among Americans, the game would be labeled with the inverse of the Korean consensus.3 A majority vote would result in this action game being annotated with the “high replayability” label in some countries (Poland, Nigeria, Germany, Colombia, Greece, Mexico,Brazil, and the US), but not it would not be annotated as such in other countries (Korea, Japan, Singapore, South Africa, Chile, andArgentina).In contrast, Figure 2 also presents an example of a consistently conceptualized label, “zen” (red line): all country subgroups—and gender and age subgroups—agree that the action game should not be annotated with this label. We further note that consistent con-ceptualization of labels is dependent on game. For example, the“zen” label is more likely to be consistently conceptualized (and not be annotated) for an action game than, say, a cozy game. As such,we consider inconsistently and consistently conceptualized labels on the basis of game-label pairs (of which there are 280 in total). We Recognize that deciding whether a label is inconsistently concep-tualized is inherently a source of bias, given that the practitioner must decide which subgroups to examine for inconsistency, and what threshold cutoffs are relevant. While we cannot provide a one-size-fits-all formal mathematical definition for inconsistent conceptualization for all domains, we use this terminology to describe labels that have high variance across and within demographic subgroups, and when the subgroup mean straddles the 50% mark for binary labels. For the ensuing analyses in this paper, we categorize 55 game-label pairs as “in-consistently conceptualized” labels, having cross-country standard deviations greater than 0.05 among post-stratified estimates (calcu-lated from the “Country” facet of Figure 2) and with post-stratified country-level estimates both over and under the majority 50% line.Cross-country standard deviations for our surveyed labels and anonymized games are presented in Figure 10 in Appendix D.Our designation of inconsistent labels is robust across reasonable definitions. The post-stratified estimates presented in Figure 2 are similar to the unweighted raw survey results (Figure 7 in Appen-dix B), indicating that our survey respondent pool is reflective of the true underlying gamer demographic distribution from which we sampled.4Our case study focuses on the inconsistent conceptualizations across countries, where there tends to be higher variance across game labels relative to age- or gender-groups of label annotations. For example, in the “high replayability” example in Figure 2, we see a 20-percentage-point spread of estimates across countries versus a roughly 10-percentage-point spread of estimates by gender. We Now turn to understanding why country-level differences arise. We present two explanations for the country-level differences in label conceptualization across our surveyed labels. The first invokes cultural frameworks from the sociology literature, and the second involves semantic differences in language translations.3.3.1 Cultural Distances. Much prior work has been conducted across sociology to measure cross-cultural similarities via indices,including the World Value Survey [35] used for our country se-lection process per Section 3.1, and the Hofstede Model of Cul-ture [32]. The Hofstede Model of Culture consists of six dimensions of national cultures (developed over the course of 1991 [32] to2010 [7, 33]): power distance, uncertainty avoidance, individual-ism/collectivism, masculinity/feminity, long/short-term orientation and indulgence/restraints. Each country is mapped to six numeric indices ranging from 0 to 100%.First, we generate a Cultural Distance Index based on the subset of Hofstede dimensions that we hypothesize can explain different countries' label annotations. To determine which dimensions are relevant, we run a logistic regression similar to subsection 3.2 across all survey responses on all games and labels, but replace the country categorical covariate with the six Hofstede dimensions. We find that the coefficients on two dimensions are significant at the p < 0.001level and have the highest magnitude of all dimensions; these two dimensions are “uncertainty” and “orientation” (regression results are presented in Table 3 in Appendix C).5The uncertainty Hofstede dimension is based on the concept of “uncertainty avoidance,” defined as “the extent to which the members of a culture feel threatened by ambiguous or unknown situations” [32] under the premise that “extreme ambiguity creates intolerable anxiety.” Hofstede’s uncertainty dimension measures how much or little a society copes with anxiety by minimizing uncertainty (a high Hofstede uncertainty dimension indicates low tolerance for uncertainty). This is considered a proxy for the threat of change to a culture. Meanwhile, the orientation Hofstede dimen-sion is on the spectrum between short-term and long-term orienta-tion. Short-term orientation is defined as “the fostering of virtues related to the past and present—in particular, respect for tradition,preservation of ‘face,’ and fulfilling social obligations”; meanwhile,long-term orientation is defined as “the fostering of virtues oriented towards future rewards—in particular, perseverance and thrift.” [32]. Both uncertainty and orientation dimensions are highly relevant to the labels with which one might annotate video games, where ambiguity, surprise, patience, and reward-seeking behaviors are often key components [45, 52].We hence calculate a Cultural Distance Index (CDI) defined as theEuclidean distance between country pairs in the uncertainty and orientation dimensions; for example, Argentina and Mexico have avery close CDI of 0.06, whereas Korea and Nigeria have a nearly polar opposite CDI of 0.92. We then explore whether countries that are more culturally similar—i.e., have a smaller CDI—also annotate game labels more similarly.To determine game label annotation similarity by country pairs,we calculate the Pearson correlation between each country’s post-stratified estimates across games and labels. Specifically, for each game and label combination, we calculate one post-stratified esti-mate of each country’s likelihood of annotating the game with that label (e.g., roughly 60% for the US, for a specific action game with the “high replayability” label, per Figure 2). We then compare esti-mates for “inconsistently” and “consistently” conceptualized labels in aggregate. Hence, for each country, we generate one 55-length vector of “inconsistently conceptualized” game-label annotation estimates, and another vector of the remaining 225 “consistently conceptualized” game-label annotation estimates. For each pair of countries, we calculate the Pearson correlation between their two55-length “inconsistently conceptualized” vectors, and the Pearson Correlation between their two 225-length “consistently conceptual-ized” vectors. The relationship between CDI and label similarity,stratified by label consistency, is plotted in Figure 3.The first takeaway is a confirmation of our definition of “in-consistently conceptualized” labels in subsection 3.2: indeed, the game-label pairs we deem to be consistently conceptualized yield high (often close to perfect) annotation correlation regardless of country pair. Meanwhile, inconsistently conceptualized labels have much lower between-country agreement. The second takeaways that as cultural distance (CDI) increases—that is, cultural simi-larity decreases—game label annotation similarity also decreases.While this is a weak decreasing effect among consistently concep-tualized labels, we in contrast see a stronger negative relationship (slope -0.3, with a weakly negative Spearman correlation of -0.4) for inconsistently conceptualized labels. For example, the culturally close countries of Mexico and Argentina have a perfect annotation correlation of 1.0 for consistently conceptualized labels, and lower but still high correlation of 0.8 for inconsistently conceptualized labels. Meanwhile, the culturally distant countries of Korea andNigeria have a high annotation correlation of 0.9 for consistently conceptualized labels and the lowest (0.0) annotation correlation for inconsistently conceptualized labels.To summarize, we find that the lower the CDI (i.e., the more“culturally similar” a pair of countries are per the Hofstede model),the more similarly respondents from those countries tend to an-notate game labels. While we cannot draw concrete causal con-clusions from specific cultural differences to general game-label conceptualization consistency, we do find that culture may play a non-negligible role in understanding country-based differences in game label annotations.3.3.2 Lost in Translation. In addition to modeling culture, an-other explanation for inconsistently conceptualized labels across countries lies in the label text itself. Translation to a different lan-guage can lead to the loss of semantic precision [67, 75], even if professionally translated, due to the fundamental difference in cul-tural conceptualization of a word. To determine whether language itself has an impact on game label annotations within a country,we compare respondents surveyed in English to a demographically-similar set of respondents surveyed in their local language, usingMahalanobis distance matching [13, 53, 72]. To ensure we capture differences in semantics and not differences in player experience,we subset to respondents who play games in English “frequently” or even more often. We then match the Xbox ambassadors (surveyed in English) to their compatriots (surveyed in their local language)on dimensions of age, gender, and gaming experience.6 Covariate balance was confirmed between the English and local survey language respondents (balance plots are reported in Figure 8 inAppendix C). We then estimate the effect of survey language on label annotation using a logistic regression on the matched sample,estimating standard error with cluster-robust variance.Overall, we find that the share of significant survey language effects is slightly higher among inconsistent labels (36%) relatively consistent labels (34%). To showcase the variability in language effects, we turn to another inconsistent label as an example: “makes me feel amused or laugh” for a specific action game.7 In Figure 4,we present the grouped mean differences for individuals annotating a certain action game as such. For demographically matched respondents in Brazil, those surveyed in English had a 21 percentage point lower respondent share answering that the game made them“feel amused or laugh,” relative to being surveyed in Portuguese. Asimilar decrease, though with a larger magnitude and statistically significant, was observed between Polish respondents answering inEnglish (63 percentage points lower) relative to Polish. Meanwhile,for demographically matched respondents in Germany, those sur-veyed in English had a statistically significant 38 percentage point higher respondent share agreeing with the label, relative to being surveyed in German. A similar increase, though not statistically significant, was observed among Mexican respondents answering in English (22 percentage points higher) relative to Spanish.We make several notes on the directions of English language effects on bilingual respondents. First, the English effect is indepen-dent across countries; for a specific label for a specific game, there is no reason to expect that all languages’ translations of that label would consistently yield either all increases, or all decreases, in the probability of annotation relative to English. Second, there is no rea-son that the direction of the English effect must persist across labels for a local language (e.g., there may be some labels that lose mean-ing when translated to that language, but other labels may have no translational difference; furthermore, some label translations may yield a higher probability of label annotation, whereas other label translations may yield a lower probability of label annotation).Third, language-based differences in a label need not persist across games (e.g., if a label—even conceptualized differently—is clearly not relevant to the game being annotated, the language differences may not be as strong).Overall, we find that differences in label translation do contribute in varying degrees to the inconsistent conceptualization of labels across countries, but are highly dependent on both the label itself and the language (as well as, of course, the quality of translation).

Then, for the games the respondent selected, they were asked to annotate the game using any of 28 labels presented (such as “action”, “cozy”,etc.). We also collected respondent demographic information such as age, gender, gaming frequency, and gaming device.For respondents in countries where English is not an official lan-guage, the entire survey text was translated to their local language.1 In this process, we performed translation and back-translation by native speakers to ensure translation consistency across lan-guages [8]. We additionally recruited a smaller sample of globalXbox Ambassadors [84]—individuals who are known to be bilingual and opt-in to additional communications from Xbox—to respond to the survey in English; the Xbox Ambassadors were primarily based in the US, Brazil, German, Mexico, and Poland. To summa-rize, all individuals with IP addresses in India, Nigeria, Singapore,South Africa, and the US were served only surveys in English; indi-viduals in all other countries were served surveys either in their local language or—if they are an Xbox Ambassador known to bebilingual—English.In total, we received 5,174 survey responses with complete demo-graphic information; the dominant respondent demographic wasUS-based men in the 25-44 age range, which is reflective of both the demographics of individuals who opt in to receive emails fromXbox, and the selection bias arising from individuals who choose to proactively fill out the survey for no reward. We explore and statistically correct for the respondents’ demographic skew relative to overall gamer populations in subsection 3.2. We begin by examining game labels that are inconsistently concep-tualized across different demographic groups, and to what extent.To do so, we perform multilevel regression and poststratification(MRP) [51, 80] to address the imbalanced nature of our dataset. Wefirst run a Bayesian logistic regression using survey respondents demographic attributes as covariates to generate a distribution of predictions for whether or not a certain label would be anno-tated for each game. Then, the ensuing predictions are weighted via post-stratification to resemble the known joint distribution of age, gender, and country demographics for Xbox players writ large.2 In doing so, our post-stratified estimates of label selection are more accurate over subgroups [62]—specifically, upweighting respondents with smaller sample sizes such as female or non-USrespondents [41, 80]. Note that for the ensuing analyses, we remove respondents from India and Saudi Arabia, as well as non-binary in-dividuals, due to recruiting only 1 or fewer respondents answering the survey for multiple games; however, we comment on extensions of our model to these subgroups in subsection 3.4. We similarly exclude anonymized Game 11 from our analysis due to low survey response rates detailed in Appendix A.As a running example, in Figure 2 we show the post-stratified predictions of the “high replayability” label for each demographic subgroup regarding a certain popular action game (anonymized in this paper). We consider the “high replayability” label for this game to be inconsistently conceptualized per the green line in Figure 2:our model estimates less than a 39% probability that gender- and age-representative Korean gamers would consider the game to be highly replayable; in a majority vote among Koreans, this game would not be given the “high replayability” label. In contrast, we estimate a 59%probability that gender- and age-representative American gamers would consider the game to be highly replayable; in a majority vote among Americans, the game would be labeled with the inverse of the Korean consensus.3 A majority vote would result in this action game being annotated with the “high replayability” label in some countries (Poland, Nigeria, Germany, Colombia, Greece, Mexico,Brazil, and the US), but not it would not be annotated as such in other countries (Korea, Japan, Singapore, South Africa, Chile, andArgentina).In contrast, Figure 2 also presents an example of a consistently conceptualized label, “zen” (red line): all country subgroups—and gender and age subgroups—agree that the action game should not be annotated with this label. We further note that consistent con-ceptualization of labels is dependent on game. For example, the“zen” label is more likely to be consistently conceptualized (and not be annotated) for an action game than, say, a cozy game. As such,we consider inconsistently and consistently conceptualized labels on the basis of game-label pairs (of which there are 280 in total). We Recognize that deciding whether a label is inconsistently concep-tualized is inherently a source of bias, given that the practitioner must decide which subgroups to examine for inconsistency, and what threshold cutoffs are relevant. While we cannot provide a one-size-fits-all formal mathematical definition for inconsistent conceptualization for all domains, we use this terminology to describe labels that have high variance across and within demographic subgroups, and when the subgroup mean straddles the 50% mark for binary labels. For the ensuing analyses in this paper, we categorize 55 game-label pairs as “in-consistently conceptualized” labels, having cross-country standard deviations greater than 0.05 among post-stratified estimates (calcu-lated from the “Country” facet of Figure 2) and with post-stratified country-level estimates both over and under the majority 50% line.Cross-country standard deviations for our surveyed labels and anonymized games are presented in Figure 10 in Appendix D.Our designation of inconsistent labels is robust across reasonable definitions. The post-stratified estimates presented in Figure 2 are similar to the unweighted raw survey results (Figure 7 in Appen-dix B), indicating that our survey respondent pool is reflective of the true underlying gamer demographic distribution from which we sampled.4Our case study focuses on the inconsistent conceptualizations across countries, where there tends to be higher variance across game labels relative to age- or gender-groups of label annotations. For example, in the “high replayability” example in Figure 2, we see a 20-percentage-point spread of estimates across countries versus a roughly 10-percentage-point spread of estimates by gender. We Now turn to understanding why country-level differences arise. We present two explanations for the country-level differences in label conceptualization across our surveyed labels. The first invokes cultural frameworks from the sociology literature, and the second involves semantic differences in language translations.3.3.1 Cultural Distances. Much prior work has been conducted across sociology to measure cross-cultural similarities via indices,including the World Value Survey [35] used for our country se-lection process per Section 3.1, and the Hofstede Model of Cul-ture [32]. The Hofstede Model of Culture consists of six dimensions of national cultures (developed over the course of 1991 [32] to2010 [7, 33]): power distance, uncertainty avoidance, individual-ism/collectivism, masculinity/feminity, long/short-term orientation and indulgence/restraints. Each country is mapped to six numeric indices ranging from 0 to 100%.First, we generate a Cultural Distance Index based on the subset of Hofstede dimensions that we hypothesize can explain different countries' label annotations. To determine which dimensions are relevant, we run a logistic regression similar to subsection 3.2 across all survey responses on all games and labels, but replace the country categorical covariate with the six Hofstede dimensions. We find that the coefficients on two dimensions are significant at the p < 0.001level and have the highest magnitude of all dimensions; these two dimensions are “uncertainty” and “orientation” (regression results are presented in Table 3 in Appendix C).5The uncertainty Hofstede dimension is based on the concept of “uncertainty avoidance,” defined as “the extent to which the members of a culture feel threatened by ambiguous or unknown situations” [32] under the premise that “extreme ambiguity creates intolerable anxiety.” Hofstede’s uncertainty dimension measures how much or little a society copes with anxiety by minimizing uncertainty (a high Hofstede uncertainty dimension indicates low tolerance for uncertainty). This is considered a proxy for the threat of change to a culture. Meanwhile, the orientation Hofstede dimen-sion is on the spectrum between short-term and long-term orienta-tion. Short-term orientation is defined as “the fostering of virtues related to the past and present—in particular, respect for tradition,preservation of ‘face,’ and fulfilling social obligations”; meanwhile,long-term orientation is defined as “the fostering of virtues oriented towards future rewards—in particular, perseverance and thrift.” [32]. Both uncertainty and orientation dimensions are highly relevant to the labels with which one might annotate video games, where ambiguity, surprise, patience, and reward-seeking behaviors are often key components [45, 52].We hence calculate a Cultural Distance Index (CDI) defined as theEuclidean distance between country pairs in the uncertainty and orientation dimensions; for example, Argentina and Mexico have avery close CDI of 0.06, whereas Korea and Nigeria have a nearly polar opposite CDI of 0.92. We then explore whether countries that are more culturally similar—i.e., have a smaller CDI—also annotate game labels more similarly.To determine game label annotation similarity by country pairs,we calculate the Pearson correlation between each country’s post-stratified estimates across games and labels. Specifically, for each game and label combination, we calculate one post-stratified esti-mate of each country’s likelihood of annotating the game with that label (e.g., roughly 60% for the US, for a specific action game with the “high replayability” label, per Figure 2). We then compare esti-mates for “inconsistently” and “consistently” conceptualized labels in aggregate. Hence, for each country, we generate one 55-length vector of “inconsistently conceptualized” game-label annotation estimates, and another vector of the remaining 225 “consistently conceptualized” game-label annotation estimates. For each pair of countries, we calculate the Pearson correlation between their two55-length “inconsistently conceptualized” vectors, and the Pearson Correlation between their two 225-length “consistently conceptual-ized” vectors. The relationship between CDI and label similarity,stratified by label consistency, is plotted in Figure 3.The first takeaway is a confirmation of our definition of “in-consistently conceptualized” labels in subsection 3.2: indeed, the game-label pairs we deem to be consistently conceptualized yield high (often close to perfect) annotation correlation regardless of country pair. Meanwhile, inconsistently conceptualized labels have much lower between-country agreement. The second takeaways that as cultural distance (CDI) increases—that is, cultural simi-larity decreases—game label annotation similarity also decreases.While this is a weak decreasing effect among consistently concep-tualized labels, we in contrast see a stronger negative relationship (slope -0.3, with a weakly negative Spearman correlation of -0.4) for inconsistently conceptualized labels. For example, the culturally close countries of Mexico and Argentina have a perfect annotation correlation of 1.0 for consistently conceptualized labels, and lower but still high correlation of 0.8 for inconsistently conceptualized labels. Meanwhile, the culturally distant countries of Korea andNigeria have a high annotation correlation of 0.9 for consistently conceptualized labels and the lowest (0.0) annotation correlation for inconsistently conceptualized labels.To summarize, we find that the lower the CDI (i.e., the more“culturally similar” a pair of countries are per the Hofstede model),the more similarly respondents from those countries tend to an-notate game labels. While we cannot draw concrete causal con-clusions from specific cultural differences to general game-label conceptualization consistency, we do find that culture may play a non-negligible role in understanding country-based differences in game label annotations.3.3.2 Lost in Translation. In addition to modeling culture, an-other explanation for inconsistently conceptualized labels across countries lies in the label text itself. Translation to a different lan-guage can lead to the loss of semantic precision [67, 75], even if professionally translated, due to the fundamental difference in cul-tural conceptualization of a word. To determine whether language itself has an impact on game label annotations within a country,we compare respondents surveyed in English to a demographically-similar set of respondents surveyed in their local language, usingMahalanobis distance matching [13, 53, 72]. To ensure we capture differences in semantics and not differences in player experience,we subset to respondents who play games in English “frequently” or even more often. We then match the Xbox ambassadors (surveyed in English) to their compatriots (surveyed in their local language)on dimensions of age, gender, and gaming experience.6 Covariate balance was confirmed between the English and local survey language respondents (balance plots are reported in Figure 8 inAppendix C). We then estimate the effect of survey language on label annotation using a logistic regression on the matched sample,estimating standard error with cluster-robust variance.Overall, we find that the share of significant survey language effects is slightly higher among inconsistent labels (36%) relatively consistent labels (34%). To showcase the variability in language effects, we turn to another inconsistent label as an example: “makes me feel amused or laugh” for a specific action game.7 In Figure 4,we present the grouped mean differences for individuals annotating a certain action game as such. For demographically matched respondents in Brazil, those surveyed in English had a 21 percentage point lower respondent share answering that the game made them“feel amused or laugh,” relative to being surveyed in Portuguese. Asimilar decrease, though with a larger magnitude and statistically significant, was observed between Polish respondents answering inEnglish (63 percentage points lower) relative to Polish. Meanwhile,for demographically matched respondents in Germany, those sur-veyed in English had a statistically significant 38 percentage point higher respondent share agreeing with the label, relative to being surveyed in German. A similar increase, though not statistically significant, was observed among Mexican respondents answering in English (22 percentage points higher) relative to Spanish.We make several notes on the directions of English language effects on bilingual respondents. First, the English effect is indepen-dent across countries; for a specific label for a specific game, there is no reason to expect that all languages’ translations of that label would consistently yield either all increases, or all decreases, in the probability of annotation relative to English. Second, there is no rea-son that the direction of the English effect must persist across labels for a local language (e.g., there may be some labels that lose mean-ing when translated to that language, but other labels may have no translational difference; furthermore, some label translations may yield a higher probability of label annotation, whereas other label translations may yield a lower probability of label annotation).Third, language-based differences in a label need not persist across games (e.g., if a label—even conceptualized differently—is clearly not relevant to the game being annotated, the language differences may not be as strong).Overall, we find that differences in label translation do contribute in varying degrees to the inconsistent conceptualization of labels across countries, but are highly dependent on both the label itself and the language (as well as, of course, the quality of translation). ",1533-7,in the “high replayability” example,
12,HighReplayabilityJudgment,Artifact,"To illustrate how we examine the consistent conceptualization of labels, we present a case study of video game labels. Game la-bels are not only pertinent for understanding the landscape of the video game industry (forecasted to grow by 50% over the next five years [17]), but also lead to better user experiences on gaming plat-forms [2]. Appropriate game labels allow for more direct searches,and can feed into more accurate recommendation systems for users.We conducted a large-scale survey in the Xbox gaming ecosystem wherein respondents annotated different games using given labels(e.g., “Is [game] an action game?”). Our analysis reveals that we can identify inconsistently conceptualized labels across countries, and we use one such label as a running example throughout the case study. We then present two explanations for why certain labels are inconsistently conceptualized, based on (1) cultural differences and (2) translation differences. Finally, we show that label predic-tions can be improved if trained on a dataset of a heterogeneous global population of annotators rather than a small homogeneous population from a single country.3.1 DataOur analysis is based on an email survey conducted in May-June2022 targeting Xbox gamers.

Then, the ensuing predictions are weighted via post-stratification to resemble the known joint distribution of age, gender, and country demographics for Xbox players writ large.2 In doing so, our post-stratified estimates of label selection are more accurate over subgroups [62]—specifically, upweighting respondents with smaller sample sizes such as female or non-USrespondents [41, 80]. Note that for the ensuing analyses, we remove respondents from India and Saudi Arabia, as well as non-binary in-dividuals, due to recruiting only 1 or fewer respondents answering the survey for multiple games; however, we comment on extensions of our model to these subgroups in subsection 3.4. We similarly exclude anonymized Game 11 from our analysis due to low survey response rates detailed in Appendix A.As a running example, in Figure 2 we show the post-stratified predictions of the “high replayability” label for each demographic subgroup regarding a certain popular action game (anonymized in this paper). We consider the “high replayability” label for this game to be inconsistently conceptualized per the green line in Figure 2:our model estimates less than a 39% probability that gender- and age-representative Korean gamers would consider the game to be highly replayable; in a majority vote among Koreans, this game would not be given the “high replayability” label. In contrast, we estimate a 59%probability that gender- and age-representative American gamers would consider the game to be highly replayable; in a majority vote among Americans, the game would be labeled with the inverse of the Korean consensus.3 A majority vote would result in this action game being annotated with the “high replayability” label in some countries (Poland, Nigeria, Germany, Colombia, Greece, Mexico,Brazil, and the US), but not it would not be annotated as such in other countries (Korea, Japan, Singapore, South Africa, Chile, andArgentina).In contrast, Figure 2 also presents an example of a consistently conceptualized label, “zen” (red line): all country subgroups—and gender and age subgroups—agree that the action game should not be annotated with this label. We further note that consistent con-ceptualization of labels is dependent on game. For example, the“zen” label is more likely to be consistently conceptualized (and not be annotated) for an action game than, say, a cozy game. As such,we consider inconsistently and consistently conceptualized labels on the basis of game-label pairs (of which there are 280 in total). We Recognize that deciding whether a label is inconsistently concep-tualized is inherently a source of bias, given that the practitioner must decide which subgroups to examine for inconsistency, and what threshold cutoffs are relevant. While we cannot provide a one-size-fits-all formal mathematical definition for inconsistent conceptualization for all domains, we use this terminology to describe labels that have high variance across and within demographic subgroups, and when the subgroup mean straddles the 50% mark for binary labels. For the ensuing analyses in this paper, we categorize 55 game-label pairs as “in-consistently conceptualized” labels, having cross-country standard deviations greater than 0.05 among post-stratified estimates (calcu-lated from the “Country” facet of Figure 2) and with post-stratified country-level estimates both over and under the majority 50% line.Cross-country standard deviations for our surveyed labels and anonymized games are presented in Figure 10 in Appendix D.Our designation of inconsistent labels is robust across reasonable definitions. The post-stratified estimates presented in Figure 2 are similar to the unweighted raw survey results (Figure 7 in Appen-dix B), indicating that our survey respondent pool is reflective of the true underlying gamer demographic distribution from which we sampled.4Our case study focuses on the inconsistent conceptualizations across countries, where there tends to be higher variance across game labels relative to age- or gender-groups of label annotations. For example, in the “high replayability” example in Figure 2, we see a 20-percentage-point spread of estimates across countries versus a roughly 10-percentage-point spread of estimates by gender. We Now turn to understanding why country-level differences arise. We present two explanations for the country-level differences in label conceptualization across our surveyed labels. The first invokes cultural frameworks from the sociology literature, and the second involves semantic differences in language translations.3.3.1 Cultural Distances. Much prior work has been conducted across sociology to measure cross-cultural similarities via indices,including the World Value Survey [35] used for our country se-lection process per Section 3.1, and the Hofstede Model of Cul-ture [32]. The Hofstede Model of Culture consists of six dimensions of national cultures (developed over the course of 1991 [32] to2010 [7, 33]): power distance, uncertainty avoidance, individual-ism/collectivism, masculinity/feminity, long/short-term orientation and indulgence/restraints. Each country is mapped to six numeric indices ranging from 0 to 100%.First, we generate a Cultural Distance Index based on the subset of Hofstede dimensions that we hypothesize can explain different countries' label annotations. To determine which dimensions are relevant, we run a logistic regression similar to subsection 3.2 across all survey responses on all games and labels, but replace the country categorical covariate with the six Hofstede dimensions. We find that the coefficients on two dimensions are significant at the p < 0.001level and have the highest magnitude of all dimensions; these two dimensions are “uncertainty” and “orientation” (regression results are presented in Table 3 in Appendix C).5The uncertainty Hofstede dimension is based on the concept of “uncertainty avoidance,” defined as “the extent to which the members of a culture feel threatened by ambiguous or unknown situations” [32] under the premise that “extreme ambiguity creates intolerable anxiety.” Hofstede’s uncertainty dimension measures how much or little a society copes with anxiety by minimizing uncertainty (a high Hofstede uncertainty dimension indicates low tolerance for uncertainty). This is considered a proxy for the threat of change to a culture. Meanwhile, the orientation Hofstede dimen-sion is on the spectrum between short-term and long-term orienta-tion. Short-term orientation is defined as “the fostering of virtues related to the past and present—in particular, respect for tradition,preservation of ‘face,’ and fulfilling social obligations”; meanwhile,long-term orientation is defined as “the fostering of virtues oriented towards future rewards—in particular, perseverance and thrift.” [32]. Both uncertainty and orientation dimensions are highly relevant to the labels with which one might annotate video games, where ambiguity, surprise, patience, and reward-seeking behaviors are often key components [45, 52].We hence calculate a Cultural Distance Index (CDI) defined as theEuclidean distance between country pairs in the uncertainty and orientation dimensions; for example, Argentina and Mexico have avery close CDI of 0.06, whereas Korea and Nigeria have a nearly polar opposite CDI of 0.92. We then explore whether countries that are more culturally similar—i.e., have a smaller CDI—also annotate game labels more similarly.To determine game label annotation similarity by country pairs,we calculate the Pearson correlation between each country’s post-stratified estimates across games and labels. Specifically, for each game and label combination, we calculate one post-stratified esti-mate of each country’s likelihood of annotating the game with that label (e.g., roughly 60% for the US, for a specific action game with the “high replayability” label, per Figure 2). We then compare esti-mates for “inconsistently” and “consistently” conceptualized labels in aggregate. Hence, for each country, we generate one 55-length vector of “inconsistently conceptualized” game-label annotation estimates, and another vector of the remaining 225 “consistently conceptualized” game-label annotation estimates. For each pair of countries, we calculate the Pearson correlation between their two55-length “inconsistently conceptualized” vectors, and the Pearson Correlation between their two 225-length “consistently conceptual-ized” vectors. The relationship between CDI and label similarity,stratified by label consistency, is plotted in Figure 3.The first takeaway is a confirmation of our definition of “in-consistently conceptualized” labels in subsection 3.2: indeed, the game-label pairs we deem to be consistently conceptualized yield high (often close to perfect) annotation correlation regardless of country pair. Meanwhile, inconsistently conceptualized labels have much lower between-country agreement. The second takeaways that as cultural distance (CDI) increases—that is, cultural simi-larity decreases—game label annotation similarity also decreases.While this is a weak decreasing effect among consistently concep-tualized labels, we in contrast see a stronger negative relationship (slope -0.3, with a weakly negative Spearman correlation of -0.4) for inconsistently conceptualized labels. For example, the culturally close countries of Mexico and Argentina have a perfect annotation correlation of 1.0 for consistently conceptualized labels, and lower but still high correlation of 0.8 for inconsistently conceptualized labels. Meanwhile, the culturally distant countries of Korea andNigeria have a high annotation correlation of 0.9 for consistently conceptualized labels and the lowest (0.0) annotation correlation for inconsistently conceptualized labels.To summarize, we find that the lower the CDI (i.e., the more“culturally similar” a pair of countries are per the Hofstede model),the more similarly respondents from those countries tend to an-notate game labels. While we cannot draw concrete causal con-clusions from specific cultural differences to general game-label conceptualization consistency, we do find that culture may play a non-negligible role in understanding country-based differences in game label annotations.3.3.2 Lost in Translation. In addition to modeling culture, an-other explanation for inconsistently conceptualized labels across countries lies in the label text itself. Translation to a different lan-guage can lead to the loss of semantic precision [67, 75], even if professionally translated, due to the fundamental difference in cul-tural conceptualization of a word. To determine whether language itself has an impact on game label annotations within a country,we compare respondents surveyed in English to a demographically-similar set of respondents surveyed in their local language, usingMahalanobis distance matching [13, 53, 72]. To ensure we capture differences in semantics and not differences in player experience,we subset to respondents who play games in English “frequently” or even more often. We then match the Xbox ambassadors (surveyed in English) to their compatriots (surveyed in their local language)on dimensions of age, gender, and gaming experience.6 Covariate balance was confirmed between the English and local survey language respondents (balance plots are reported in Figure 8 inAppendix C). We then estimate the effect of survey language on label annotation using a logistic regression on the matched sample,estimating standard error with cluster-robust variance.Overall, we find that the share of significant survey language effects is slightly higher among inconsistent labels (36%) relatively consistent labels (34%). To showcase the variability in language effects, we turn to another inconsistent label as an example: “makes me feel amused or laugh” for a specific action game.7 In Figure 4,we present the grouped mean differences for individuals annotating a certain action game as such. For demographically matched respondents in Brazil, those surveyed in English had a 21 percentage point lower respondent share answering that the game made them“feel amused or laugh,” relative to being surveyed in Portuguese. Asimilar decrease, though with a larger magnitude and statistically significant, was observed between Polish respondents answering inEnglish (63 percentage points lower) relative to Polish. Meanwhile,for demographically matched respondents in Germany, those sur-veyed in English had a statistically significant 38 percentage point higher respondent share agreeing with the label, relative to being surveyed in German. A similar increase, though not statistically significant, was observed among Mexican respondents answering in English (22 percentage points higher) relative to Spanish.We make several notes on the directions of English language effects on bilingual respondents. First, the English effect is indepen-dent across countries; for a specific label for a specific game, there is no reason to expect that all languages’ translations of that label would consistently yield either all increases, or all decreases, in the probability of annotation relative to English. Second, there is no rea-son that the direction of the English effect must persist across labels for a local language (e.g., there may be some labels that lose mean-ing when translated to that language, but other labels may have no translational difference; furthermore, some label translations may yield a higher probability of label annotation, whereas other label translations may yield a lower probability of label annotation).Third, language-based differences in a label need not persist across games (e.g., if a label—even conceptualized differently—is clearly not relevant to the game being annotated, the language differences may not be as strong).Overall, we find that differences in label translation do contribute in varying degrees to the inconsistent conceptualization of labels across countries, but are highly dependent on both the label itself and the language (as well as, of course, the quality of translation).

14,SemanticImprecision,Artifact,"To illustrate how we examine the consistent conceptualization of labels, we present a case study of video game labels. Game la-bels are not only pertinent for understanding the landscape of the video game industry (forecasted to grow by 50% over the next five years [17]), but also lead to better user experiences on gaming plat-forms [2]. Appropriate game labels allow for more direct searches,and can feed into more accurate recommendation systems for users.We conducted a large-scale survey in the Xbox gaming ecosystem wherein respondents annotated different games using given labels(e.g., “Is [game] an action game?”). Our analysis reveals that we can identify inconsistently conceptualized labels across countries, and we use one such label as a running example throughout the case study. We then present two explanations for why certain labels are inconsistently conceptualized, based on (1) cultural differences and (2) translation differences. Finally, we show that label predic-tions can be improved if trained on a dataset of a heterogeneous global population of annotators rather than a small homogeneous population from a single country.3.1 DataOur analysis is based on an email survey conducted in May-June2022 targeting Xbox gamers. The survey was run in 16 countries:Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Brazil, Germany, Greece, Japan,Poland, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, India, Nigeria, Singapore, SouthAfrica, and the United States. These countries were selected to provide coverage of all distinct regions in the Inglehart–Welzel Cultural Map [35].The survey first allowed the respondent to select which of 11 popular video games they had played in the past year. Then, for the games the respondent selected, they were asked to annotate the game using any of 28 labels presented (such as “action”, “cozy”,etc.). We also collected respondent demographic information such as age, gender, gaming frequency, and gaming device.For respondents in countries where English is not an official lan-guage, the entire survey text was translated to their local language.1 In this process, we performed translation and back-translation by native speakers to ensure translation consistency across lan-guages [8]. We additionally recruited a smaller sample of globalXbox Ambassadors [84]—individuals who are known to be bilingual and opt-in to additional communications from Xbox—to respond to the survey in English; the Xbox Ambassadors were primarily based in the US, Brazil, German, Mexico, and Poland. To summa-rize, all individuals with IP addresses in India, Nigeria, Singapore,South Africa, and the US were served only surveys in English; indi-viduals in all other countries were served surveys either in their local language or—if they are an Xbox Ambassador known to bebilingual—English.In total, we received 5,174 survey responses with complete demo-graphic information; the dominant respondent demographic wasUS-based men in the 25-44 age range, which is reflective of both the demographics of individuals who opt in to receive emails fromXbox, and the selection bias arising from individuals who choose to proactively fill out the survey for no reward. We explore and statistically correct for the respondents’ demographic skew relative to overall gamer populations in subsection 3.2.

For example, the“zen” label is more likely to be consistently conceptualized (and not be annotated) for an action game than, say, a cozy game. As such,we consider inconsistently and consistently conceptualized labels on the basis of game-label pairs (of which there are 280 in total). We Recognize that deciding whether a label is inconsistently concep-tualized is inherently a source of bias, given that the practitioner must decide which subgroups to examine for inconsistency, and what threshold cutoffs are relevant. While we cannot provide a one-size-fits-all formal mathematical definition for inconsistent conceptualization for all domains, we use this terminology to describe labels that have high variance across and within demographic subgroups, and when the subgroup mean straddles the 50% mark for binary labels. For the ensuing analyses in this paper, we categorize 55 game-label pairs as “in-consistently conceptualized” labels, having cross-country standard deviations greater than 0.05 among post-stratified estimates (calcu-lated from the “Country” facet of Figure 2) and with post-stratified country-level estimates both over and under the majority 50% line.Cross-country standard deviations for our surveyed labels and anonymized games are presented in Figure 10 in Appendix D.Our designation of inconsistent labels is robust across reasonable definitions. The post-stratified estimates presented in Figure 2 are similar to the unweighted raw survey results (Figure 7 in Appen-dix B), indicating that our survey respondent pool is reflective of the true underlying gamer demographic distribution from which we sampled.4Our case study focuses on the inconsistent conceptualizations across countries, where there tends to be higher variance across game labels relative to age- or gender-groups of label annotations. For example, in the “high replayability” example in Figure 2, we see a 20-percentage-point spread of estimates across countries versus a roughly 10-percentage-point spread of estimates by gender. We Now turn to understanding why country-level differences arise. We present two explanations for the country-level differences in label conceptualization across our surveyed labels. The first invokes cultural frameworks from the sociology literature, and the second involves semantic differences in language translations.3.3.1 Cultural Distances. Much prior work has been conducted across sociology to measure cross-cultural similarities via indices,including the World Value Survey [35] used for our country se-lection process per Section 3.1, and the Hofstede Model of Cul-ture [32]. The Hofstede Model of Culture consists of six dimensions of national cultures (developed over the course of 1991 [32] to2010 [7, 33]): power distance, uncertainty avoidance, individual-ism/collectivism, masculinity/feminity, long/short-term orientation and indulgence/restraints. Each country is mapped to six numeric indices ranging from 0 to 100%.First, we generate a Cultural Distance Index based on the subset of Hofstede dimensions that we hypothesize can explain different countries' label annotations. To determine which dimensions are relevant, we run a logistic regression similar to subsection 3.2 across all survey responses on all games and labels, but replace the country categorical covariate with the six Hofstede dimensions. We find that the coefficients on two dimensions are significant at the p < 0.001level and have the highest magnitude of all dimensions; these two dimensions are “uncertainty” and “orientation” (regression results are presented in Table 3 in Appendix C).5The uncertainty Hofstede dimension is based on the concept of “uncertainty avoidance,” defined as “the extent to which the members of a culture feel threatened by ambiguous or unknown situations” [32] under the premise that “extreme ambiguity creates intolerable anxiety.” Hofstede’s uncertainty dimension measures how much or little a society copes with anxiety by minimizing uncertainty (a high Hofstede uncertainty dimension indicates low tolerance for uncertainty). This is considered a proxy for the threat of change to a culture. Meanwhile, the orientation Hofstede dimen-sion is on the spectrum between short-term and long-term orienta-tion. Short-term orientation is defined as “the fostering of virtues related to the past and present—in particular, respect for tradition,preservation of ‘face,’ and fulfilling social obligations”; meanwhile,long-term orientation is defined as “the fostering of virtues oriented towards future rewards—in particular, perseverance and thrift.” [32]. Both uncertainty and orientation dimensions are highly relevant to the labels with which one might annotate video games, where ambiguity, surprise, patience, and reward-seeking behaviors are often key components [45, 52].We hence calculate a Cultural Distance Index (CDI) defined as theEuclidean distance between country pairs in the uncertainty and orientation dimensions; for example, Argentina and Mexico have avery close CDI of 0.06, whereas Korea and Nigeria have a nearly polar opposite CDI of 0.92. We then explore whether countries that are more culturally similar—i.e., have a smaller CDI—also annotate game labels more similarly.To determine game label annotation similarity by country pairs,we calculate the Pearson correlation between each country’s post-stratified estimates across games and labels. Specifically, for each game and label combination, we calculate one post-stratified esti-mate of each country’s likelihood of annotating the game with that label (e.g., roughly 60% for the US, for a specific action game with the “high replayability” label, per Figure 2). We then compare esti-mates for “inconsistently” and “consistently” conceptualized labels in aggregate. Hence, for each country, we generate one 55-length vector of “inconsistently conceptualized” game-label annotation estimates, and another vector of the remaining 225 “consistently conceptualized” game-label annotation estimates. For each pair of countries, we calculate the Pearson correlation between their two55-length “inconsistently conceptualized” vectors, and the Pearson Correlation between their two 225-length “consistently conceptual-ized” vectors. The relationship between CDI and label similarity,stratified by label consistency, is plotted in Figure 3.The first takeaway is a confirmation of our definition of “in-consistently conceptualized” labels in subsection 3.2: indeed, the game-label pairs we deem to be consistently conceptualized yield high (often close to perfect) annotation correlation regardless of country pair. Meanwhile, inconsistently conceptualized labels have much lower between-country agreement. The second takeaways that as cultural distance (CDI) increases—that is, cultural simi-larity decreases—game label annotation similarity also decreases.While this is a weak decreasing effect among consistently concep-tualized labels, we in contrast see a stronger negative relationship (slope -0.3, with a weakly negative Spearman correlation of -0.4) for inconsistently conceptualized labels. For example, the culturally close countries of Mexico and Argentina have a perfect annotation correlation of 1.0 for consistently conceptualized labels, and lower but still high correlation of 0.8 for inconsistently conceptualized labels. Meanwhile, the culturally distant countries of Korea andNigeria have a high annotation correlation of 0.9 for consistently conceptualized labels and the lowest (0.0) annotation correlation for inconsistently conceptualized labels.To summarize, we find that the lower the CDI (i.e., the more“culturally similar” a pair of countries are per the Hofstede model),the more similarly respondents from those countries tend to an-notate game labels. While we cannot draw concrete causal con-clusions from specific cultural differences to general game-label conceptualization consistency, we do find that culture may play a non-negligible role in understanding country-based differences in game label annotations.3.3.2 Lost in Translation. In addition to modeling culture, an-other explanation for inconsistently conceptualized labels across countries lies in the label text itself. Translation to a different lan-guage can lead to the loss of semantic precision [67, 75], even if professionally translated, due to the fundamental difference in cul-tural conceptualization of a word. To determine whether language itself has an impact on game label annotations within a country,we compare respondents surveyed in English to a demographically-similar set of respondents surveyed in their local language, usingMahalanobis distance matching [13, 53, 72]. To ensure we capture differences in semantics and not differences in player experience,we subset to respondents who play games in English “frequently” or even more often. We then match the Xbox ambassadors (surveyed in English) to their compatriots (surveyed in their local language)on dimensions of age, gender, and gaming experience.6 Covariate balance was confirmed between the English and local survey language respondents (balance plots are reported in Figure 8 inAppendix C). We then estimate the effect of survey language on label annotation using a logistic regression on the matched sample,estimating standard error with cluster-robust variance.Overall, we find that the share of significant survey language effects is slightly higher among inconsistent labels (36%) relatively consistent labels (34%). To showcase the variability in language effects, we turn to another inconsistent label as an example: “makes me feel amused or laugh” for a specific action game.7 In Figure 4,we present the grouped mean differences for individuals annotating a certain action game as such. For demographically matched respondents in Brazil, those surveyed in English had a 21 percentage point lower respondent share answering that the game made them“feel amused or laugh,” relative to being surveyed in Portuguese. Asimilar decrease, though with a larger magnitude and statistically significant, was observed between Polish respondents answering inEnglish (63 percentage points lower) relative to Polish. Meanwhile,for demographically matched respondents in Germany, those sur-veyed in English had a statistically significant 38 percentage point higher respondent share agreeing with the label, relative to being surveyed in German. A similar increase, though not statistically significant, was observed among Mexican respondents answering in English (22 percentage points higher) relative to Spanish.We make several notes on the directions of English language effects on bilingual respondents. First, the English effect is indepen-dent across countries; for a specific label for a specific game, there is no reason to expect that all languages’ translations of that label would consistently yield either all increases, or all decreases, in the probability of annotation relative to English. Second, there is no rea-son that the direction of the English effect must persist across labels for a local language (e.g., there may be some labels that lose mean-ing when translated to that language, but other labels may have no translational difference; furthermore, some label translations may yield a higher probability of label annotation, whereas other label translations may yield a lower probability of label annotation).Third, language-based differences in a label need not persist across games (e.g., if a label—even conceptualized differently—is clearly not relevant to the game being annotated, the language differences may not be as strong).Overall, we find that differences in label translation do contribute in varying degrees to the inconsistent conceptualization of labels across countries, but are highly dependent on both the label itself and the language (as well as, of course, the quality of translation).

16,Bias,Causal_Theory,"To illustrate how we examine the consistent conceptualization of labels, we present a case study of video game labels. Game la-bels are not only pertinent for understanding the landscape of the video game industry (forecasted to grow by 50% over the next five years [17]), but also lead to better user experiences on gaming plat-forms [2]. Appropriate game labels allow for more direct searches,and can feed into more accurate recommendation systems for users.We conducted a large-scale survey in the Xbox gaming ecosystem wherein respondents annotated different games using given labels(e.g., “Is [game] an action game?”). Our analysis reveals that we can identify inconsistently conceptualized labels across countries, and we use one such label as a running example throughout the case study. We then present two explanations for why certain labels are inconsistently conceptualized, based on (1) cultural differences and (2) translation differences. Finally, we show that label predic-tions can be improved if trained on a dataset of a heterogeneous global population of annotators rather than a small homogeneous population from a single country.3.1 DataOur analysis is based on an email survey conducted in May-June2022 targeting Xbox gamers. The survey was run in 16 countries:Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Brazil, Germany, Greece, Japan,Poland, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, India, Nigeria, Singapore, SouthAfrica, and the United States. These countries were selected to provide coverage of all distinct regions in the Inglehart–Welzel Cultural Map [35].The survey first allowed the respondent to select which of 11 popular video games they had played in the past year. Then, for the games the respondent selected, they were asked to annotate the game using any of 28 labels presented (such as “action”, “cozy”,etc.). We also collected respondent demographic information such as age, gender, gaming frequency, and gaming device.For respondents in countries where English is not an official lan-guage, the entire survey text was translated to their local language.1 In this process, we performed translation and back-translation by native speakers to ensure translation consistency across lan-guages [8]. We additionally recruited a smaller sample of globalXbox Ambassadors [84]—individuals who are known to be bilingual and opt-in to additional communications from Xbox—to respond to the survey in English; the Xbox Ambassadors were primarily based in the US, Brazil, German, Mexico, and Poland. To summa-rize, all individuals with IP addresses in India, Nigeria, Singapore,South Africa, and the US were served only surveys in English; indi-viduals in all other countries were served surveys either in their local language or—if they are an Xbox Ambassador known to bebilingual—English.In total, we received 5,174 survey responses with complete demo-graphic information; the dominant respondent demographic wasUS-based men in the 25-44 age range, which is reflective of both the demographics of individuals who opt in to receive emails fromXbox, and the selection bias arising from individuals who choose to proactively fill out the survey for no reward. We explore and statistically correct for the respondents’ demographic skew relative to overall gamer populations in subsection 3.2. We begin by examining game labels that are inconsistently concep-tualized across different demographic groups, and to what extent.To do so, we perform multilevel regression and poststratification(MRP) [51, 80] to address the imbalanced nature of our dataset. Wefirst run a Bayesian logistic regression using survey respondents demographic attributes as covariates to generate a distribution of predictions for whether or not a certain label would be anno-tated for each game. Then, the ensuing predictions are weighted via post-stratification to resemble the known joint distribution of age, gender, and country demographics for Xbox players writ large.2 In doing so, our post-stratified estimates of label selection are more accurate over subgroups [62]—specifically, upweighting respondents with smaller sample sizes such as female or non-USrespondents [41, 80]. Note that for the ensuing analyses, we remove respondents from India and Saudi Arabia, as well as non-binary in-dividuals, due to recruiting only 1 or fewer respondents answering the survey for multiple games; however, we comment on extensions of our model to these subgroups in subsection 3.4. We similarly exclude anonymized Game 11 from our analysis due to low survey response rates detailed in Appendix A.As a running example, in Figure 2 we show the post-stratified predictions of the “high replayability” label for each demographic subgroup regarding a certain popular action game (anonymized in this paper). We consider the “high replayability” label for this game to be inconsistently conceptualized per the green line in Figure 2:our model estimates less than a 39% probability that gender- and age-representative Korean gamers would consider the game to be highly replayable; in a majority vote among Koreans, this game would not be given the “high replayability” label. In contrast, we estimate a 59%probability that gender- and age-representative American gamers would consider the game to be highly replayable; in a majority vote among Americans, the game would be labeled with the inverse of the Korean consensus.3 A majority vote would result in this action game being annotated with the “high replayability” label in some countries (Poland, Nigeria, Germany, Colombia, Greece, Mexico,Brazil, and the US), but not it would not be annotated as such in other countries (Korea, Japan, Singapore, South Africa, Chile, andArgentina).In contrast, Figure 2 also presents an example of a consistently conceptualized label, “zen” (red line): all country subgroups—and gender and age subgroups—agree that the action game should not be annotated with this label.

For example, in the “high replayability” example in Figure 2, we see a 20-percentage-point spread of estimates across countries versus a roughly 10-percentage-point spread of estimates by gender. We Now turn to understanding why country-level differences arise. We present two explanations for the country-level differences in label conceptualization across our surveyed labels. The first invokes cultural frameworks from the sociology literature, and the second involves semantic differences in language translations.3.3.1 Cultural Distances. Much prior work has been conducted across sociology to measure cross-cultural similarities via indices,including the World Value Survey [35] used for our country se-lection process per Section 3.1, and the Hofstede Model of Cul-ture [32]. The Hofstede Model of Culture consists of six dimensions of national cultures (developed over the course of 1991 [32] to2010 [7, 33]): power distance, uncertainty avoidance, individual-ism/collectivism, masculinity/feminity, long/short-term orientation and indulgence/restraints. Each country is mapped to six numeric indices ranging from 0 to 100%.First, we generate a Cultural Distance Index based on the subset of Hofstede dimensions that we hypothesize can explain different countries' label annotations. To determine which dimensions are relevant, we run a logistic regression similar to subsection 3.2 across all survey responses on all games and labels, but replace the country categorical covariate with the six Hofstede dimensions. We find that the coefficients on two dimensions are significant at the p < 0.001level and have the highest magnitude of all dimensions; these two dimensions are “uncertainty” and “orientation” (regression results are presented in Table 3 in Appendix C).5The uncertainty Hofstede dimension is based on the concept of “uncertainty avoidance,” defined as “the extent to which the members of a culture feel threatened by ambiguous or unknown situations” [32] under the premise that “extreme ambiguity creates intolerable anxiety.” Hofstede’s uncertainty dimension measures how much or little a society copes with anxiety by minimizing uncertainty (a high Hofstede uncertainty dimension indicates low tolerance for uncertainty). This is considered a proxy for the threat of change to a culture. Meanwhile, the orientation Hofstede dimen-sion is on the spectrum between short-term and long-term orienta-tion. Short-term orientation is defined as “the fostering of virtues related to the past and present—in particular, respect for tradition,preservation of ‘face,’ and fulfilling social obligations”; meanwhile,long-term orientation is defined as “the fostering of virtues oriented towards future rewards—in particular, perseverance and thrift.” [32]. Both uncertainty and orientation dimensions are highly relevant to the labels with which one might annotate video games, where ambiguity, surprise, patience, and reward-seeking behaviors are often key components [45, 52].We hence calculate a Cultural Distance Index (CDI) defined as theEuclidean distance between country pairs in the uncertainty and orientation dimensions; for example, Argentina and Mexico have avery close CDI of 0.06, whereas Korea and Nigeria have a nearly polar opposite CDI of 0.92. We then explore whether countries that are more culturally similar—i.e., have a smaller CDI—also annotate game labels more similarly.To determine game label annotation similarity by country pairs,we calculate the Pearson correlation between each country’s post-stratified estimates across games and labels. Specifically, for each game and label combination, we calculate one post-stratified esti-mate of each country’s likelihood of annotating the game with that label (e.g., roughly 60% for the US, for a specific action game with the “high replayability” label, per Figure 2). We then compare esti-mates for “inconsistently” and “consistently” conceptualized labels in aggregate. Hence, for each country, we generate one 55-length vector of “inconsistently conceptualized” game-label annotation estimates, and another vector of the remaining 225 “consistently conceptualized” game-label annotation estimates. For each pair of countries, we calculate the Pearson correlation between their two55-length “inconsistently conceptualized” vectors, and the Pearson Correlation between their two 225-length “consistently conceptual-ized” vectors. The relationship between CDI and label similarity,stratified by label consistency, is plotted in Figure 3.The first takeaway is a confirmation of our definition of “in-consistently conceptualized” labels in subsection 3.2: indeed, the game-label pairs we deem to be consistently conceptualized yield high (often close to perfect) annotation correlation regardless of country pair. Meanwhile, inconsistently conceptualized labels have much lower between-country agreement. The second takeaways that as cultural distance (CDI) increases—that is, cultural simi-larity decreases—game label annotation similarity also decreases.While this is a weak decreasing effect among consistently concep-tualized labels, we in contrast see a stronger negative relationship (slope -0.3, with a weakly negative Spearman correlation of -0.4) for inconsistently conceptualized labels. For example, the culturally close countries of Mexico and Argentina have a perfect annotation correlation of 1.0 for consistently conceptualized labels, and lower but still high correlation of 0.8 for inconsistently conceptualized labels. Meanwhile, the culturally distant countries of Korea andNigeria have a high annotation correlation of 0.9 for consistently conceptualized labels and the lowest (0.0) annotation correlation for inconsistently conceptualized labels.To summarize, we find that the lower the CDI (i.e., the more“culturally similar” a pair of countries are per the Hofstede model),the more similarly respondents from those countries tend to an-notate game labels. While we cannot draw concrete causal con-clusions from specific cultural differences to general game-label conceptualization consistency, we do find that culture may play a non-negligible role in understanding country-based differences in game label annotations.3.3.2 Lost in Translation. In addition to modeling culture, an-other explanation for inconsistently conceptualized labels across countries lies in the label text itself. Translation to a different lan-guage can lead to the loss of semantic precision [67, 75], even if professionally translated, due to the fundamental difference in cul-tural conceptualization of a word. To determine whether language itself has an impact on game label annotations within a country,we compare respondents surveyed in English to a demographically-similar set of respondents surveyed in their local language, usingMahalanobis distance matching [13, 53, 72]. To ensure we capture differences in semantics and not differences in player experience,we subset to respondents who play games in English “frequently” or even more often. We then match the Xbox ambassadors (surveyed in English) to their compatriots (surveyed in their local language)on dimensions of age, gender, and gaming experience.6 Covariate balance was confirmed between the English and local survey language respondents (balance plots are reported in Figure 8 inAppendix C). We then estimate the effect of survey language on label annotation using a logistic regression on the matched sample,estimating standard error with cluster-robust variance.Overall, we find that the share of significant survey language effects is slightly higher among inconsistent labels (36%) relatively consistent labels (34%). To showcase the variability in language effects, we turn to another inconsistent label as an example: “makes me feel amused or laugh” for a specific action game.7 In Figure 4,we present the grouped mean differences for individuals annotating a certain action game as such. For demographically matched respondents in Brazil, those surveyed in English had a 21 percentage point lower respondent share answering that the game made them“feel amused or laugh,” relative to being surveyed in Portuguese. Asimilar decrease, though with a larger magnitude and statistically significant, was observed between Polish respondents answering inEnglish (63 percentage points lower) relative to Polish. Meanwhile,for demographically matched respondents in Germany, those sur-veyed in English had a statistically significant 38 percentage point higher respondent share agreeing with the label, relative to being surveyed in German. A similar increase, though not statistically significant, was observed among Mexican respondents answering in English (22 percentage points higher) relative to Spanish.We make several notes on the directions of English language effects on bilingual respondents. First, the English effect is indepen-dent across countries; for a specific label for a specific game, there is no reason to expect that all languages’ translations of that label would consistently yield either all increases, or all decreases, in the probability of annotation relative to English. Second, there is no rea-son that the direction of the English effect must persist across labels for a local language (e.g., there may be some labels that lose mean-ing when translated to that language, but other labels may have no translational difference; furthermore, some label translations may yield a higher probability of label annotation, whereas other label translations may yield a lower probability of label annotation).Third, language-based differences in a label need not persist across games (e.g., if a label—even conceptualized differently—is clearly not relevant to the game being annotated, the language differences may not be as strong).Overall, we find that differences in label translation do contribute in varying degrees to the inconsistent conceptualization of labels across countries, but are highly dependent on both the label itself and the language (as well as, of course, the quality of translation).

18,Orientation,Causal_Theory,"To illustrate how we examine the consistent conceptualization of labels, we present a case study of video game labels. Game la-bels are not only pertinent for understanding the landscape of the video game industry (forecasted to grow by 50% over the next five years [17]), but also lead to better user experiences on gaming plat-forms [2]. Appropriate game labels allow for more direct searches,and can feed into more accurate recommendation systems for users.We conducted a large-scale survey in the Xbox gaming ecosystem wherein respondents annotated different games using given labels(e.g., “Is [game] an action game?”). Our analysis reveals that we can identify inconsistently conceptualized labels across countries, and we use one such label as a running example throughout the case study. We then present two explanations for why certain labels are inconsistently conceptualized, based on (1) cultural differences and (2) translation differences. Finally, we show that label predic-tions can be improved if trained on a dataset of a heterogeneous global population of annotators rather than a small homogeneous population from a single country.3.1 DataOur analysis is based on an email survey conducted in May-June2022 targeting Xbox gamers. The survey was run in 16 countries:Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Brazil, Germany, Greece, Japan,Poland, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, India, Nigeria, Singapore, SouthAfrica, and the United States. These countries were selected to provide coverage of all distinct regions in the Inglehart–Welzel Cultural Map [35].The survey first allowed the respondent to select which of 11 popular video games they had played in the past year. Then, for the games the respondent selected, they were asked to annotate the game using any of 28 labels presented (such as “action”, “cozy”,etc.). We also collected respondent demographic information such as age, gender, gaming frequency, and gaming device.For respondents in countries where English is not an official lan-guage, the entire survey text was translated to their local language.1 In this process, we performed translation and back-translation by native speakers to ensure translation consistency across lan-guages [8]. We additionally recruited a smaller sample of globalXbox Ambassadors [84]—individuals who are known to be bilingual and opt-in to additional communications from Xbox—to respond to the survey in English; the Xbox Ambassadors were primarily based in the US, Brazil, German, Mexico, and Poland. To summa-rize, all individuals with IP addresses in India, Nigeria, Singapore,South Africa, and the US were served only surveys in English; indi-viduals in all other countries were served surveys either in their local language or—if they are an Xbox Ambassador known to bebilingual—English.In total, we received 5,174 survey responses with complete demo-graphic information; the dominant respondent demographic wasUS-based men in the 25-44 age range, which is reflective of both the demographics of individuals who opt in to receive emails fromXbox, and the selection bias arising from individuals who choose to proactively fill out the survey for no reward. We explore and statistically correct for the respondents’ demographic skew relative to overall gamer populations in subsection 3.2. We begin by examining game labels that are inconsistently concep-tualized across different demographic groups, and to what extent.To do so, we perform multilevel regression and poststratification(MRP) [51, 80] to address the imbalanced nature of our dataset. Wefirst run a Bayesian logistic regression using survey respondents demographic attributes as covariates to generate a distribution of predictions for whether or not a certain label would be anno-tated for each game. Then, the ensuing predictions are weighted via post-stratification to resemble the known joint distribution of age, gender, and country demographics for Xbox players writ large.2 In doing so, our post-stratified estimates of label selection are more accurate over subgroups [62]—specifically, upweighting respondents with smaller sample sizes such as female or non-USrespondents [41, 80]. Note that for the ensuing analyses, we remove respondents from India and Saudi Arabia, as well as non-binary in-dividuals, due to recruiting only 1 or fewer respondents answering the survey for multiple games; however, we comment on extensions of our model to these subgroups in subsection 3.4. We similarly exclude anonymized Game 11 from our analysis due to low survey response rates detailed in Appendix A.As a running example, in Figure 2 we show the post-stratified predictions of the “high replayability” label for each demographic subgroup regarding a certain popular action game (anonymized in this paper). We consider the “high replayability” label for this game to be inconsistently conceptualized per the green line in Figure 2:our model estimates less than a 39% probability that gender- and age-representative Korean gamers would consider the game to be highly replayable; in a majority vote among Koreans, this game would not be given the “high replayability” label. In contrast, we estimate a 59%probability that gender- and age-representative American gamers would consider the game to be highly replayable; in a majority vote among Americans, the game would be labeled with the inverse of the Korean consensus.3 A majority vote would result in this action game being annotated with the “high replayability” label in some countries (Poland, Nigeria, Germany, Colombia, Greece, Mexico,Brazil, and the US), but not it would not be annotated as such in other countries (Korea, Japan, Singapore, South Africa, Chile, andArgentina).In contrast, Figure 2 also presents an example of a consistently conceptualized label, “zen” (red line): all country subgroups—and gender and age subgroups—agree that the action game should not be annotated with this label. We further note that consistent con-ceptualization of labels is dependent on game. For example, the“zen” label is more likely to be consistently conceptualized (and not be annotated) for an action game than, say, a cozy game. As such,we consider inconsistently and consistently conceptualized labels on the basis of game-label pairs (of which there are 280 in total). We Recognize that deciding whether a label is inconsistently concep-tualized is inherently a source of bias, given that the practitioner must decide which subgroups to examine for inconsistency, and what threshold cutoffs are relevant. While we cannot provide a one-size-fits-all formal mathematical definition for inconsistent conceptualization for all domains, we use this terminology to describe labels that have high variance across and within demographic subgroups, and when the subgroup mean straddles the 50% mark for binary labels. For the ensuing analyses in this paper, we categorize 55 game-label pairs as “in-consistently conceptualized” labels, having cross-country standard deviations greater than 0.05 among post-stratified estimates (calcu-lated from the “Country” facet of Figure 2) and with post-stratified country-level estimates both over and under the majority 50% line.Cross-country standard deviations for our surveyed labels and anonymized games are presented in Figure 10 in Appendix D.Our designation of inconsistent labels is robust across reasonable definitions.

We find that the coefficients on two dimensions are significant at the p < 0.001level and have the highest magnitude of all dimensions; these two dimensions are “uncertainty” and “orientation” (regression results are presented in Table 3 in Appendix C).5The uncertainty Hofstede dimension is based on the concept of “uncertainty avoidance,” defined as “the extent to which the members of a culture feel threatened by ambiguous or unknown situations” [32] under the premise that “extreme ambiguity creates intolerable anxiety.” Hofstede’s uncertainty dimension measures how much or little a society copes with anxiety by minimizing uncertainty (a high Hofstede uncertainty dimension indicates low tolerance for uncertainty). This is considered a proxy for the threat of change to a culture. Meanwhile, the orientation Hofstede dimen-sion is on the spectrum between short-term and long-term orienta-tion. Short-term orientation is defined as “the fostering of virtues related to the past and present—in particular, respect for tradition,preservation of ‘face,’ and fulfilling social obligations”; meanwhile,long-term orientation is defined as “the fostering of virtues oriented towards future rewards—in particular, perseverance and thrift.” [32]. Both uncertainty and orientation dimensions are highly relevant to the labels with which one might annotate video games, where ambiguity, surprise, patience, and reward-seeking behaviors are often key components [45, 52].We hence calculate a Cultural Distance Index (CDI) defined as theEuclidean distance between country pairs in the uncertainty and orientation dimensions; for example, Argentina and Mexico have avery close CDI of 0.06, whereas Korea and Nigeria have a nearly polar opposite CDI of 0.92. We then explore whether countries that are more culturally similar—i.e., have a smaller CDI—also annotate game labels more similarly.To determine game label annotation similarity by country pairs,we calculate the Pearson correlation between each country’s post-stratified estimates across games and labels. Specifically, for each game and label combination, we calculate one post-stratified esti-mate of each country’s likelihood of annotating the game with that label (e.g., roughly 60% for the US, for a specific action game with the “high replayability” label, per Figure 2). We then compare esti-mates for “inconsistently” and “consistently” conceptualized labels in aggregate. Hence, for each country, we generate one 55-length vector of “inconsistently conceptualized” game-label annotation estimates, and another vector of the remaining 225 “consistently conceptualized” game-label annotation estimates. For each pair of countries, we calculate the Pearson correlation between their two55-length “inconsistently conceptualized” vectors, and the Pearson Correlation between their two 225-length “consistently conceptual-ized” vectors. The relationship between CDI and label similarity,stratified by label consistency, is plotted in Figure 3.The first takeaway is a confirmation of our definition of “in-consistently conceptualized” labels in subsection 3.2: indeed, the game-label pairs we deem to be consistently conceptualized yield high (often close to perfect) annotation correlation regardless of country pair. Meanwhile, inconsistently conceptualized labels have much lower between-country agreement. The second takeaways that as cultural distance (CDI) increases—that is, cultural simi-larity decreases—game label annotation similarity also decreases.While this is a weak decreasing effect among consistently concep-tualized labels, we in contrast see a stronger negative relationship (slope -0.3, with a weakly negative Spearman correlation of -0.4) for inconsistently conceptualized labels. For example, the culturally close countries of Mexico and Argentina have a perfect annotation correlation of 1.0 for consistently conceptualized labels, and lower but still high correlation of 0.8 for inconsistently conceptualized labels. Meanwhile, the culturally distant countries of Korea andNigeria have a high annotation correlation of 0.9 for consistently conceptualized labels and the lowest (0.0) annotation correlation for inconsistently conceptualized labels.To summarize, we find that the lower the CDI (i.e., the more“culturally similar” a pair of countries are per the Hofstede model),the more similarly respondents from those countries tend to an-notate game labels. While we cannot draw concrete causal con-clusions from specific cultural differences to general game-label conceptualization consistency, we do find that culture may play a non-negligible role in understanding country-based differences in game label annotations.3.3.2 Lost in Translation. In addition to modeling culture, an-other explanation for inconsistently conceptualized labels across countries lies in the label text itself. Translation to a different lan-guage can lead to the loss of semantic precision [67, 75], even if professionally translated, due to the fundamental difference in cul-tural conceptualization of a word. To determine whether language itself has an impact on game label annotations within a country,we compare respondents surveyed in English to a demographically-similar set of respondents surveyed in their local language, usingMahalanobis distance matching [13, 53, 72]. To ensure we capture differences in semantics and not differences in player experience,we subset to respondents who play games in English “frequently” or even more often. We then match the Xbox ambassadors (surveyed in English) to their compatriots (surveyed in their local language)on dimensions of age, gender, and gaming experience.6 Covariate balance was confirmed between the English and local survey language respondents (balance plots are reported in Figure 8 inAppendix C). We then estimate the effect of survey language on label annotation using a logistic regression on the matched sample,estimating standard error with cluster-robust variance.Overall, we find that the share of significant survey language effects is slightly higher among inconsistent labels (36%) relatively consistent labels (34%). To showcase the variability in language effects, we turn to another inconsistent label as an example: “makes me feel amused or laugh” for a specific action game.7 In Figure 4,we present the grouped mean differences for individuals annotating a certain action game as such. For demographically matched respondents in Brazil, those surveyed in English had a 21 percentage point lower respondent share answering that the game made them“feel amused or laugh,” relative to being surveyed in Portuguese. Asimilar decrease, though with a larger magnitude and statistically significant, was observed between Polish respondents answering inEnglish (63 percentage points lower) relative to Polish. Meanwhile,for demographically matched respondents in Germany, those sur-veyed in English had a statistically significant 38 percentage point higher respondent share agreeing with the label, relative to being surveyed in German. A similar increase, though not statistically significant, was observed among Mexican respondents answering in English (22 percentage points higher) relative to Spanish.We make several notes on the directions of English language effects on bilingual respondents. First, the English effect is indepen-dent across countries; for a specific label for a specific game, there is no reason to expect that all languages’ translations of that label would consistently yield either all increases, or all decreases, in the probability of annotation relative to English. Second, there is no rea-son that the direction of the English effect must persist across labels for a local language (e.g., there may be some labels that lose mean-ing when translated to that language, but other labels may have no translational difference; furthermore, some label translations may yield a higher probability of label annotation, whereas other label translations may yield a lower probability of label annotation).Third, language-based differences in a label need not persist across games (e.g., if a label—even conceptualized differently—is clearly not relevant to the game being annotated, the language differences may not be as strong).Overall, we find that differences in label translation do contribute in varying degrees to the inconsistent conceptualization of labels across countries, but are highly dependent on both the label itself and the language (as well as, of course, the quality of translation).

23,XboxUsers,hasProducedArtifact,GameAnnotations,"To illustrate how we examine the consistent conceptualization of labels, we present a case study of video game labels. Game la-bels are not only pertinent for understanding the landscape of the video game industry (forecasted to grow by 50% over the next five years [17]), but also lead to better user experiences on gaming plat-forms [2]. Appropriate game labels allow for more direct searches,and can feed into more accurate recommendation systems for users.We conducted a large-scale survey in the Xbox gaming ecosystem wherein respondents annotated different games using given labels(e.g., “Is [game] an action game?”). Our analysis reveals that we can identify inconsistently conceptualized labels across countries, and we use one such label as a running example throughout the case study. We then present two explanations for why certain labels are inconsistently conceptualized, based on (1) cultural differences and (2) translation differences. Finally, we show that label predic-tions can be improved if trained on a dataset of a heterogeneous global population of annotators rather than a small homogeneous population from a single country.3.1 DataOur analysis is based on an email survey conducted in May-June2022 targeting Xbox gamers. The survey was run in 16 countries:Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Brazil, Germany, Greece, Japan,Poland, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, India, Nigeria, Singapore, SouthAfrica, and the United States. These countries were selected to provide coverage of all distinct regions in the Inglehart–Welzel Cultural Map [35].The survey first allowed the respondent to select which of 11 popular video games they had played in the past year. Then, for the games the respondent selected, they were asked to annotate the game using any of 28 labels presented (such as “action”, “cozy”,etc.). We also collected respondent demographic information such as age, gender, gaming frequency, and gaming device.For respondents in countries where English is not an official lan-guage, the entire survey text was translated to their local language.1 In this process, we performed translation and back-translation by native speakers to ensure translation consistency across lan-guages [8]. We additionally recruited a smaller sample of globalXbox Ambassadors [84]—individuals who are known to be bilingual and opt-in to additional communications from Xbox—to respond to the survey in English; the Xbox Ambassadors were primarily based in the US, Brazil, German, Mexico, and Poland. To summa-rize, all individuals with IP addresses in India, Nigeria, Singapore,South Africa, and the US were served only surveys in English; indi-viduals in all other countries were served surveys either in their local language or—if they are an Xbox Ambassador known to bebilingual—English.In total, we received 5,174 survey responses with complete demo-graphic information; the dominant respondent demographic wasUS-based men in the 25-44 age range, which is reflective of both the demographics of individuals who opt in to receive emails fromXbox, and the selection bias arising from individuals who choose to proactively fill out the survey for no reward. We explore and statistically correct for the respondents’ demographic skew relative to overall gamer populations in subsection 3.2. We begin by examining game labels that are inconsistently concep-tualized across different demographic groups, and to what extent.To do so, we perform multilevel regression and poststratification(MRP) [51, 80] to address the imbalanced nature of our dataset. Wefirst run a Bayesian logistic regression using survey respondents demographic attributes as covariates to generate a distribution of predictions for whether or not a certain label would be anno-tated for each game. Then, the ensuing predictions are weighted via post-stratification to resemble the known joint distribution of age, gender, and country demographics for Xbox players writ large.2 In doing so, our post-stratified estimates of label selection are more accurate over subgroups [62]—specifically, upweighting respondents with smaller sample sizes such as female or non-USrespondents [41, 80]. Note that for the ensuing analyses, we remove respondents from India and Saudi Arabia, as well as non-binary in-dividuals, due to recruiting only 1 or fewer respondents answering the survey for multiple games; however, we comment on extensions of our model to these subgroups in subsection 3.4. We similarly exclude anonymized Game 11 from our analysis due to low survey response rates detailed in Appendix A.As a running example, in Figure 2 we show the post-stratified predictions of the “high replayability” label for each demographic subgroup regarding a certain popular action game (anonymized in this paper). We consider the “high replayability” label for this game to be inconsistently conceptualized per the green line in Figure 2:our model estimates less than a 39% probability that gender- and age-representative Korean gamers would consider the game to be highly replayable; in a majority vote among Koreans, this game would not be given the “high replayability” label. In contrast, we estimate a 59%probability that gender- and age-representative American gamers would consider the game to be highly replayable; in a majority vote among Americans, the game would be labeled with the inverse of the Korean consensus.3 A majority vote would result in this action game being annotated with the “high replayability” label in some countries (Poland, Nigeria, Germany, Colombia, Greece, Mexico,Brazil, and the US), but not it would not be annotated as such in other countries (Korea, Japan, Singapore, South Africa, Chile, andArgentina).In contrast, Figure 2 also presents an example of a consistently conceptualized label, “zen” (red line): all country subgroups—and gender and age subgroups—agree that the action game should not be annotated with this label. We further note that consistent con-ceptualization of labels is dependent on game. For example, the“zen” label is more likely to be consistently conceptualized (and not be annotated) for an action game than, say, a cozy game. As such,we consider inconsistently and consistently conceptualized labels on the basis of game-label pairs (of which there are 280 in total). We Recognize that deciding whether a label is inconsistently concep-tualized is inherently a source of bias, given that the practitioner must decide which subgroups to examine for inconsistency, and what threshold cutoffs are relevant. While we cannot provide a one-size-fits-all formal mathematical definition for inconsistent conceptualization for all domains, we use this terminology to describe labels that have high variance across and within demographic subgroups, and when the subgroup mean straddles the 50% mark for binary labels. For the ensuing analyses in this paper, we categorize 55 game-label pairs as “in-consistently conceptualized” labels, having cross-country standard deviations greater than 0.05 among post-stratified estimates (calcu-lated from the “Country” facet of Figure 2) and with post-stratified country-level estimates both over and under the majority 50% line.Cross-country standard deviations for our surveyed labels and anonymized games are presented in Figure 10 in Appendix D.Our designation of inconsistent labels is robust across reasonable definitions. The post-stratified estimates presented in Figure 2 are similar to the unweighted raw survey results (Figure 7 in Appen-dix B), indicating that our survey respondent pool is reflective of the true underlying gamer demographic distribution from which we sampled.4Our case study focuses on the inconsistent conceptualizations across countries, where there tends to be higher variance across game labels relative to age- or gender-groups of label annotations. For example, in the “high replayability” example in Figure 2, we see a 20-percentage-point spread of estimates across countries versus a roughly 10-percentage-point spread of estimates by gender. We Now turn to understanding why country-level differences arise. We present two explanations for the country-level differences in label conceptualization across our surveyed labels. The first invokes cultural frameworks from the sociology literature, and the second involves semantic differences in language translations.3.3.1 Cultural Distances. Much prior work has been conducted across sociology to measure cross-cultural similarities via indices,including the World Value Survey [35] used for our country se-lection process per Section 3.1, and the Hofstede Model of Cul-ture [32]. The Hofstede Model of Culture consists of six dimensions of national cultures (developed over the course of 1991 [32] to2010 [7, 33]): power distance, uncertainty avoidance, individual-ism/collectivism, masculinity/feminity, long/short-term orientation and indulgence/restraints. Each country is mapped to six numeric indices ranging from 0 to 100%.First, we generate a Cultural Distance Index based on the subset of Hofstede dimensions that we hypothesize can explain different countries' label annotations. To determine which dimensions are relevant, we run a logistic regression similar to subsection 3.2 across all survey responses on all games and labels, but replace the country categorical covariate with the six Hofstede dimensions. We find that the coefficients on two dimensions are significant at the p < 0.001level and have the highest magnitude of all dimensions; these two dimensions are “uncertainty” and “orientation” (regression results are presented in Table 3 in Appendix C).5The uncertainty Hofstede dimension is based on the concept of “uncertainty avoidance,” defined as “the extent to which the members of a culture feel threatened by ambiguous or unknown situations” [32] under the premise that “extreme ambiguity creates intolerable anxiety.” Hofstede’s uncertainty dimension measures how much or little a society copes with anxiety by minimizing uncertainty (a high Hofstede uncertainty dimension indicates low tolerance for uncertainty). This is considered a proxy for the threat of change to a culture. Meanwhile, the orientation Hofstede dimen-sion is on the spectrum between short-term and long-term orienta-tion. Short-term orientation is defined as “the fostering of virtues related to the past and present—in particular, respect for tradition,preservation of ‘face,’ and fulfilling social obligations”; meanwhile,long-term orientation is defined as “the fostering of virtues oriented towards future rewards—in particular, perseverance and thrift.” [32]. Both uncertainty and orientation dimensions are highly relevant to the labels with which one might annotate video games, where ambiguity, surprise, patience, and reward-seeking behaviors are often key components [45, 52].We hence calculate a Cultural Distance Index (CDI) defined as theEuclidean distance between country pairs in the uncertainty and orientation dimensions; for example, Argentina and Mexico have avery close CDI of 0.06, whereas Korea and Nigeria have a nearly polar opposite CDI of 0.92.

Specifically, for each game and label combination, we calculate one post-stratified esti-mate of each country’s likelihood of annotating the game with that label (e.g., roughly 60% for the US, for a specific action game with the “high replayability” label, per Figure 2). We then compare esti-mates for “inconsistently” and “consistently” conceptualized labels in aggregate. Hence, for each country, we generate one 55-length vector of “inconsistently conceptualized” game-label annotation estimates, and another vector of the remaining 225 “consistently conceptualized” game-label annotation estimates. For each pair of countries, we calculate the Pearson correlation between their two55-length “inconsistently conceptualized” vectors, and the Pearson Correlation between their two 225-length “consistently conceptual-ized” vectors. The relationship between CDI and label similarity,stratified by label consistency, is plotted in Figure 3.The first takeaway is a confirmation of our definition of “in-consistently conceptualized” labels in subsection 3.2: indeed, the game-label pairs we deem to be consistently conceptualized yield high (often close to perfect) annotation correlation regardless of country pair. Meanwhile, inconsistently conceptualized labels have much lower between-country agreement. The second takeaways that as cultural distance (CDI) increases—that is, cultural simi-larity decreases—game label annotation similarity also decreases.While this is a weak decreasing effect among consistently concep-tualized labels, we in contrast see a stronger negative relationship (slope -0.3, with a weakly negative Spearman correlation of -0.4) for inconsistently conceptualized labels. For example, the culturally close countries of Mexico and Argentina have a perfect annotation correlation of 1.0 for consistently conceptualized labels, and lower but still high correlation of 0.8 for inconsistently conceptualized labels. Meanwhile, the culturally distant countries of Korea andNigeria have a high annotation correlation of 0.9 for consistently conceptualized labels and the lowest (0.0) annotation correlation for inconsistently conceptualized labels.To summarize, we find that the lower the CDI (i.e., the more“culturally similar” a pair of countries are per the Hofstede model),the more similarly respondents from those countries tend to an-notate game labels. While we cannot draw concrete causal con-clusions from specific cultural differences to general game-label conceptualization consistency, we do find that culture may play a non-negligible role in understanding country-based differences in game label annotations.3.3.2 Lost in Translation. In addition to modeling culture, an-other explanation for inconsistently conceptualized labels across countries lies in the label text itself. Translation to a different lan-guage can lead to the loss of semantic precision [67, 75], even if professionally translated, due to the fundamental difference in cul-tural conceptualization of a word. To determine whether language itself has an impact on game label annotations within a country,we compare respondents surveyed in English to a demographically-similar set of respondents surveyed in their local language, usingMahalanobis distance matching [13, 53, 72]. To ensure we capture differences in semantics and not differences in player experience,we subset to respondents who play games in English “frequently” or even more often. We then match the Xbox ambassadors (surveyed in English) to their compatriots (surveyed in their local language)on dimensions of age, gender, and gaming experience.6 Covariate balance was confirmed between the English and local survey language respondents (balance plots are reported in Figure 8 inAppendix C). We then estimate the effect of survey language on label annotation using a logistic regression on the matched sample,estimating standard error with cluster-robust variance.Overall, we find that the share of significant survey language effects is slightly higher among inconsistent labels (36%) relatively consistent labels (34%). To showcase the variability in language effects, we turn to another inconsistent label as an example: “makes me feel amused or laugh” for a specific action game.7 In Figure 4,we present the grouped mean differences for individuals annotating a certain action game as such. For demographically matched respondents in Brazil, those surveyed in English had a 21 percentage point lower respondent share answering that the game made them“feel amused or laugh,” relative to being surveyed in Portuguese. Asimilar decrease, though with a larger magnitude and statistically significant, was observed between Polish respondents answering inEnglish (63 percentage points lower) relative to Polish. Meanwhile,for demographically matched respondents in Germany, those sur-veyed in English had a statistically significant 38 percentage point higher respondent share agreeing with the label, relative to being surveyed in German. A similar increase, though not statistically significant, was observed among Mexican respondents answering in English (22 percentage points higher) relative to Spanish.We make several notes on the directions of English language effects on bilingual respondents. First, the English effect is indepen-dent across countries; for a specific label for a specific game, there is no reason to expect that all languages’ translations of that label would consistently yield either all increases, or all decreases, in the probability of annotation relative to English. Second, there is no rea-son that the direction of the English effect must persist across labels for a local language (e.g., there may be some labels that lose mean-ing when translated to that language, but other labels may have no translational difference; furthermore, some label translations may yield a higher probability of label annotation, whereas other label translations may yield a lower probability of label annotation).Third, language-based differences in a label need not persist across games (e.g., if a label—even conceptualized differently—is clearly not relevant to the game being annotated, the language differences may not be as strong).Overall, we find that differences in label translation do contribute in varying degrees to the inconsistent conceptualization of labels across countries, but are highly dependent on both the label itself and the language (as well as, of course, the quality of translation). ",1533-7,analysis reveals that we can identify inconsistently conceptualized labels across countries
25,GameAnnotations,reflectsPrecept,Bias,"To illustrate how we examine the consistent conceptualization of labels, we present a case study of video game labels. Game la-bels are not only pertinent for understanding the landscape of the video game industry (forecasted to grow by 50% over the next five years [17]), but also lead to better user experiences on gaming plat-forms [2]. Appropriate game labels allow for more direct searches,and can feed into more accurate recommendation systems for users.We conducted a large-scale survey in the Xbox gaming ecosystem wherein respondents annotated different games using given labels(e.g., “Is [game] an action game?”). Our analysis reveals that we can identify inconsistently conceptualized labels across countries, and we use one such label as a running example throughout the case study. We then present two explanations for why certain labels are inconsistently conceptualized, based on (1) cultural differences and (2) translation differences. Finally, we show that label predic-tions can be improved if trained on a dataset of a heterogeneous global population of annotators rather than a small homogeneous population from a single country.3.1 DataOur analysis is based on an email survey conducted in May-June2022 targeting Xbox gamers. The survey was run in 16 countries:Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Brazil, Germany, Greece, Japan,Poland, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, India, Nigeria, Singapore, SouthAfrica, and the United States. These countries were selected to provide coverage of all distinct regions in the Inglehart–Welzel Cultural Map [35].The survey first allowed the respondent to select which of 11 popular video games they had played in the past year. Then, for the games the respondent selected, they were asked to annotate the game using any of 28 labels presented (such as “action”, “cozy”,etc.). We also collected respondent demographic information such as age, gender, gaming frequency, and gaming device.For respondents in countries where English is not an official lan-guage, the entire survey text was translated to their local language.1 In this process, we performed translation and back-translation by native speakers to ensure translation consistency across lan-guages [8]. We additionally recruited a smaller sample of globalXbox Ambassadors [84]—individuals who are known to be bilingual and opt-in to additional communications from Xbox—to respond to the survey in English; the Xbox Ambassadors were primarily based in the US, Brazil, German, Mexico, and Poland. To summa-rize, all individuals with IP addresses in India, Nigeria, Singapore,South Africa, and the US were served only surveys in English; indi-viduals in all other countries were served surveys either in their local language or—if they are an Xbox Ambassador known to bebilingual—English.In total, we received 5,174 survey responses with complete demo-graphic information; the dominant respondent demographic wasUS-based men in the 25-44 age range, which is reflective of both the demographics of individuals who opt in to receive emails fromXbox, and the selection bias arising from individuals who choose to proactively fill out the survey for no reward. We explore and statistically correct for the respondents’ demographic skew relative to overall gamer populations in subsection 3.2. We begin by examining game labels that are inconsistently concep-tualized across different demographic groups, and to what extent.To do so, we perform multilevel regression and poststratification(MRP) [51, 80] to address the imbalanced nature of our dataset. Wefirst run a Bayesian logistic regression using survey respondents demographic attributes as covariates to generate a distribution of predictions for whether or not a certain label would be anno-tated for each game. Then, the ensuing predictions are weighted via post-stratification to resemble the known joint distribution of age, gender, and country demographics for Xbox players writ large.2 In doing so, our post-stratified estimates of label selection are more accurate over subgroups [62]—specifically, upweighting respondents with smaller sample sizes such as female or non-USrespondents [41, 80]. Note that for the ensuing analyses, we remove respondents from India and Saudi Arabia, as well as non-binary in-dividuals, due to recruiting only 1 or fewer respondents answering the survey for multiple games; however, we comment on extensions of our model to these subgroups in subsection 3.4. We similarly exclude anonymized Game 11 from our analysis due to low survey response rates detailed in Appendix A.As a running example, in Figure 2 we show the post-stratified predictions of the “high replayability” label for each demographic subgroup regarding a certain popular action game (anonymized in this paper). We consider the “high replayability” label for this game to be inconsistently conceptualized per the green line in Figure 2:our model estimates less than a 39% probability that gender- and age-representative Korean gamers would consider the game to be highly replayable; in a majority vote among Koreans, this game would not be given the “high replayability” label. In contrast, we estimate a 59%probability that gender- and age-representative American gamers would consider the game to be highly replayable; in a majority vote among Americans, the game would be labeled with the inverse of the Korean consensus.3 A majority vote would result in this action game being annotated with the “high replayability” label in some countries (Poland, Nigeria, Germany, Colombia, Greece, Mexico,Brazil, and the US), but not it would not be annotated as such in other countries (Korea, Japan, Singapore, South Africa, Chile, andArgentina).In contrast, Figure 2 also presents an example of a consistently conceptualized label, “zen” (red line): all country subgroups—and gender and age subgroups—agree that the action game should not be annotated with this label. We further note that consistent con-ceptualization of labels is dependent on game. For example, the“zen” label is more likely to be consistently conceptualized (and not be annotated) for an action game than, say, a cozy game. As such,we consider inconsistently and consistently conceptualized labels on the basis of game-label pairs (of which there are 280 in total). We Recognize that deciding whether a label is inconsistently concep-tualized is inherently a source of bias, given that the practitioner must decide which subgroups to examine for inconsistency, and what threshold cutoffs are relevant. While we cannot provide a one-size-fits-all formal mathematical definition for inconsistent conceptualization for all domains, we use this terminology to describe labels that have high variance across and within demographic subgroups, and when the subgroup mean straddles the 50% mark for binary labels. For the ensuing analyses in this paper, we categorize 55 game-label pairs as “in-consistently conceptualized” labels, having cross-country standard deviations greater than 0.05 among post-stratified estimates (calcu-lated from the “Country” facet of Figure 2) and with post-stratified country-level estimates both over and under the majority 50% line.Cross-country standard deviations for our surveyed labels and anonymized games are presented in Figure 10 in Appendix D.Our designation of inconsistent labels is robust across reasonable definitions. The post-stratified estimates presented in Figure 2 are similar to the unweighted raw survey results (Figure 7 in Appen-dix B), indicating that our survey respondent pool is reflective of the true underlying gamer demographic distribution from which we sampled.4Our case study focuses on the inconsistent conceptualizations across countries, where there tends to be higher variance across game labels relative to age- or gender-groups of label annotations. For example, in the “high replayability” example in Figure 2, we see a 20-percentage-point spread of estimates across countries versus a roughly 10-percentage-point spread of estimates by gender. We Now turn to understanding why country-level differences arise. We present two explanations for the country-level differences in label conceptualization across our surveyed labels. The first invokes cultural frameworks from the sociology literature, and the second involves semantic differences in language translations.3.3.1 Cultural Distances. Much prior work has been conducted across sociology to measure cross-cultural similarities via indices,including the World Value Survey [35] used for our country se-lection process per Section 3.1, and the Hofstede Model of Cul-ture [32]. The Hofstede Model of Culture consists of six dimensions of national cultures (developed over the course of 1991 [32] to2010 [7, 33]): power distance, uncertainty avoidance, individual-ism/collectivism, masculinity/feminity, long/short-term orientation and indulgence/restraints. Each country is mapped to six numeric indices ranging from 0 to 100%.First, we generate a Cultural Distance Index based on the subset of Hofstede dimensions that we hypothesize can explain different countries' label annotations. To determine which dimensions are relevant, we run a logistic regression similar to subsection 3.2 across all survey responses on all games and labels, but replace the country categorical covariate with the six Hofstede dimensions. We find that the coefficients on two dimensions are significant at the p < 0.001level and have the highest magnitude of all dimensions; these two dimensions are “uncertainty” and “orientation” (regression results are presented in Table 3 in Appendix C).5The uncertainty Hofstede dimension is based on the concept of “uncertainty avoidance,” defined as “the extent to which the members of a culture feel threatened by ambiguous or unknown situations” [32] under the premise that “extreme ambiguity creates intolerable anxiety.” Hofstede’s uncertainty dimension measures how much or little a society copes with anxiety by minimizing uncertainty (a high Hofstede uncertainty dimension indicates low tolerance for uncertainty). This is considered a proxy for the threat of change to a culture. Meanwhile, the orientation Hofstede dimen-sion is on the spectrum between short-term and long-term orienta-tion. Short-term orientation is defined as “the fostering of virtues related to the past and present—in particular, respect for tradition,preservation of ‘face,’ and fulfilling social obligations”; meanwhile,long-term orientation is defined as “the fostering of virtues oriented towards future rewards—in particular, perseverance and thrift.” [32]. Both uncertainty and orientation dimensions are highly relevant to the labels with which one might annotate video games, where ambiguity, surprise, patience, and reward-seeking behaviors are often key components [45, 52].We hence calculate a Cultural Distance Index (CDI) defined as theEuclidean distance between country pairs in the uncertainty and orientation dimensions; for example, Argentina and Mexico have avery close CDI of 0.06, whereas Korea and Nigeria have a nearly polar opposite CDI of 0.92.

For example, the culturally close countries of Mexico and Argentina have a perfect annotation correlation of 1.0 for consistently conceptualized labels, and lower but still high correlation of 0.8 for inconsistently conceptualized labels. Meanwhile, the culturally distant countries of Korea andNigeria have a high annotation correlation of 0.9 for consistently conceptualized labels and the lowest (0.0) annotation correlation for inconsistently conceptualized labels.To summarize, we find that the lower the CDI (i.e., the more“culturally similar” a pair of countries are per the Hofstede model),the more similarly respondents from those countries tend to an-notate game labels. While we cannot draw concrete causal con-clusions from specific cultural differences to general game-label conceptualization consistency, we do find that culture may play a non-negligible role in understanding country-based differences in game label annotations.3.3.2 Lost in Translation. In addition to modeling culture, an-other explanation for inconsistently conceptualized labels across countries lies in the label text itself. Translation to a different lan-guage can lead to the loss of semantic precision [67, 75], even if professionally translated, due to the fundamental difference in cul-tural conceptualization of a word. To determine whether language itself has an impact on game label annotations within a country,we compare respondents surveyed in English to a demographically-similar set of respondents surveyed in their local language, usingMahalanobis distance matching [13, 53, 72]. To ensure we capture differences in semantics and not differences in player experience,we subset to respondents who play games in English “frequently” or even more often. We then match the Xbox ambassadors (surveyed in English) to their compatriots (surveyed in their local language)on dimensions of age, gender, and gaming experience.6 Covariate balance was confirmed between the English and local survey language respondents (balance plots are reported in Figure 8 inAppendix C). We then estimate the effect of survey language on label annotation using a logistic regression on the matched sample,estimating standard error with cluster-robust variance.Overall, we find that the share of significant survey language effects is slightly higher among inconsistent labels (36%) relatively consistent labels (34%). To showcase the variability in language effects, we turn to another inconsistent label as an example: “makes me feel amused or laugh” for a specific action game.7 In Figure 4,we present the grouped mean differences for individuals annotating a certain action game as such. For demographically matched respondents in Brazil, those surveyed in English had a 21 percentage point lower respondent share answering that the game made them“feel amused or laugh,” relative to being surveyed in Portuguese. Asimilar decrease, though with a larger magnitude and statistically significant, was observed between Polish respondents answering inEnglish (63 percentage points lower) relative to Polish. Meanwhile,for demographically matched respondents in Germany, those sur-veyed in English had a statistically significant 38 percentage point higher respondent share agreeing with the label, relative to being surveyed in German. A similar increase, though not statistically significant, was observed among Mexican respondents answering in English (22 percentage points higher) relative to Spanish.We make several notes on the directions of English language effects on bilingual respondents. First, the English effect is indepen-dent across countries; for a specific label for a specific game, there is no reason to expect that all languages’ translations of that label would consistently yield either all increases, or all decreases, in the probability of annotation relative to English. Second, there is no rea-son that the direction of the English effect must persist across labels for a local language (e.g., there may be some labels that lose mean-ing when translated to that language, but other labels may have no translational difference; furthermore, some label translations may yield a higher probability of label annotation, whereas other label translations may yield a lower probability of label annotation).Third, language-based differences in a label need not persist across games (e.g., if a label—even conceptualized differently—is clearly not relevant to the game being annotated, the language differences may not be as strong).Overall, we find that differences in label translation do contribute in varying degrees to the inconsistent conceptualization of labels across countries, but are highly dependent on both the label itself and the language (as well as, of course, the quality of translation).

27,GameAnnotations,reflectsPrecept,Uncertainty,"To illustrate how we examine the consistent conceptualization of labels, we present a case study of video game labels. Game la-bels are not only pertinent for understanding the landscape of the video game industry (forecasted to grow by 50% over the next five years [17]), but also lead to better user experiences on gaming plat-forms [2]. Appropriate game labels allow for more direct searches,and can feed into more accurate recommendation systems for users.We conducted a large-scale survey in the Xbox gaming ecosystem wherein respondents annotated different games using given labels(e.g., “Is [game] an action game?”). Our analysis reveals that we can identify inconsistently conceptualized labels across countries, and we use one such label as a running example throughout the case study. We then present two explanations for why certain labels are inconsistently conceptualized, based on (1) cultural differences and (2) translation differences. Finally, we show that label predic-tions can be improved if trained on a dataset of a heterogeneous global population of annotators rather than a small homogeneous population from a single country.3.1 DataOur analysis is based on an email survey conducted in May-June2022 targeting Xbox gamers. The survey was run in 16 countries:Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Brazil, Germany, Greece, Japan,Poland, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, India, Nigeria, Singapore, SouthAfrica, and the United States. These countries were selected to provide coverage of all distinct regions in the Inglehart–Welzel Cultural Map [35].The survey first allowed the respondent to select which of 11 popular video games they had played in the past year. Then, for the games the respondent selected, they were asked to annotate the game using any of 28 labels presented (such as “action”, “cozy”,etc.). We also collected respondent demographic information such as age, gender, gaming frequency, and gaming device.For respondents in countries where English is not an official lan-guage, the entire survey text was translated to their local language.1 In this process, we performed translation and back-translation by native speakers to ensure translation consistency across lan-guages [8]. We additionally recruited a smaller sample of globalXbox Ambassadors [84]—individuals who are known to be bilingual and opt-in to additional communications from Xbox—to respond to the survey in English; the Xbox Ambassadors were primarily based in the US, Brazil, German, Mexico, and Poland. To summa-rize, all individuals with IP addresses in India, Nigeria, Singapore,South Africa, and the US were served only surveys in English; indi-viduals in all other countries were served surveys either in their local language or—if they are an Xbox Ambassador known to bebilingual—English.In total, we received 5,174 survey responses with complete demo-graphic information; the dominant respondent demographic wasUS-based men in the 25-44 age range, which is reflective of both the demographics of individuals who opt in to receive emails fromXbox, and the selection bias arising from individuals who choose to proactively fill out the survey for no reward. We explore and statistically correct for the respondents’ demographic skew relative to overall gamer populations in subsection 3.2. We begin by examining game labels that are inconsistently concep-tualized across different demographic groups, and to what extent.To do so, we perform multilevel regression and poststratification(MRP) [51, 80] to address the imbalanced nature of our dataset. Wefirst run a Bayesian logistic regression using survey respondents demographic attributes as covariates to generate a distribution of predictions for whether or not a certain label would be anno-tated for each game. Then, the ensuing predictions are weighted via post-stratification to resemble the known joint distribution of age, gender, and country demographics for Xbox players writ large.2 In doing so, our post-stratified estimates of label selection are more accurate over subgroups [62]—specifically, upweighting respondents with smaller sample sizes such as female or non-USrespondents [41, 80]. Note that for the ensuing analyses, we remove respondents from India and Saudi Arabia, as well as non-binary in-dividuals, due to recruiting only 1 or fewer respondents answering the survey for multiple games; however, we comment on extensions of our model to these subgroups in subsection 3.4. We similarly exclude anonymized Game 11 from our analysis due to low survey response rates detailed in Appendix A.As a running example, in Figure 2 we show the post-stratified predictions of the “high replayability” label for each demographic subgroup regarding a certain popular action game (anonymized in this paper). We consider the “high replayability” label for this game to be inconsistently conceptualized per the green line in Figure 2:our model estimates less than a 39% probability that gender- and age-representative Korean gamers would consider the game to be highly replayable; in a majority vote among Koreans, this game would not be given the “high replayability” label. In contrast, we estimate a 59%probability that gender- and age-representative American gamers would consider the game to be highly replayable; in a majority vote among Americans, the game would be labeled with the inverse of the Korean consensus.3 A majority vote would result in this action game being annotated with the “high replayability” label in some countries (Poland, Nigeria, Germany, Colombia, Greece, Mexico,Brazil, and the US), but not it would not be annotated as such in other countries (Korea, Japan, Singapore, South Africa, Chile, andArgentina).In contrast, Figure 2 also presents an example of a consistently conceptualized label, “zen” (red line): all country subgroups—and gender and age subgroups—agree that the action game should not be annotated with this label. We further note that consistent con-ceptualization of labels is dependent on game. For example, the“zen” label is more likely to be consistently conceptualized (and not be annotated) for an action game than, say, a cozy game. As such,we consider inconsistently and consistently conceptualized labels on the basis of game-label pairs (of which there are 280 in total). We Recognize that deciding whether a label is inconsistently concep-tualized is inherently a source of bias, given that the practitioner must decide which subgroups to examine for inconsistency, and what threshold cutoffs are relevant. While we cannot provide a one-size-fits-all formal mathematical definition for inconsistent conceptualization for all domains, we use this terminology to describe labels that have high variance across and within demographic subgroups, and when the subgroup mean straddles the 50% mark for binary labels. For the ensuing analyses in this paper, we categorize 55 game-label pairs as “in-consistently conceptualized” labels, having cross-country standard deviations greater than 0.05 among post-stratified estimates (calcu-lated from the “Country” facet of Figure 2) and with post-stratified country-level estimates both over and under the majority 50% line.Cross-country standard deviations for our surveyed labels and anonymized games are presented in Figure 10 in Appendix D.Our designation of inconsistent labels is robust across reasonable definitions. The post-stratified estimates presented in Figure 2 are similar to the unweighted raw survey results (Figure 7 in Appen-dix B), indicating that our survey respondent pool is reflective of the true underlying gamer demographic distribution from which we sampled.4Our case study focuses on the inconsistent conceptualizations across countries, where there tends to be higher variance across game labels relative to age- or gender-groups of label annotations. For example, in the “high replayability” example in Figure 2, we see a 20-percentage-point spread of estimates across countries versus a roughly 10-percentage-point spread of estimates by gender. We Now turn to understanding why country-level differences arise. We present two explanations for the country-level differences in label conceptualization across our surveyed labels. The first invokes cultural frameworks from the sociology literature, and the second involves semantic differences in language translations.3.3.1 Cultural Distances. Much prior work has been conducted across sociology to measure cross-cultural similarities via indices,including the World Value Survey [35] used for our country se-lection process per Section 3.1, and the Hofstede Model of Cul-ture [32]. The Hofstede Model of Culture consists of six dimensions of national cultures (developed over the course of 1991 [32] to2010 [7, 33]): power distance, uncertainty avoidance, individual-ism/collectivism, masculinity/feminity, long/short-term orientation and indulgence/restraints. Each country is mapped to six numeric indices ranging from 0 to 100%.First, we generate a Cultural Distance Index based on the subset of Hofstede dimensions that we hypothesize can explain different countries' label annotations. To determine which dimensions are relevant, we run a logistic regression similar to subsection 3.2 across all survey responses on all games and labels, but replace the country categorical covariate with the six Hofstede dimensions. We find that the coefficients on two dimensions are significant at the p < 0.001level and have the highest magnitude of all dimensions; these two dimensions are “uncertainty” and “orientation” (regression results are presented in Table 3 in Appendix C).5The uncertainty Hofstede dimension is based on the concept of “uncertainty avoidance,” defined as “the extent to which the members of a culture feel threatened by ambiguous or unknown situations” [32] under the premise that “extreme ambiguity creates intolerable anxiety.” Hofstede’s uncertainty dimension measures how much or little a society copes with anxiety by minimizing uncertainty (a high Hofstede uncertainty dimension indicates low tolerance for uncertainty). This is considered a proxy for the threat of change to a culture. Meanwhile, the orientation Hofstede dimen-sion is on the spectrum between short-term and long-term orienta-tion. Short-term orientation is defined as “the fostering of virtues related to the past and present—in particular, respect for tradition,preservation of ‘face,’ and fulfilling social obligations”; meanwhile,long-term orientation is defined as “the fostering of virtues oriented towards future rewards—in particular, perseverance and thrift.” [32]. Both uncertainty and orientation dimensions are highly relevant to the labels with which one might annotate video games, where ambiguity, surprise, patience, and reward-seeking behaviors are often key components [45, 52].We hence calculate a Cultural Distance Index (CDI) defined as theEuclidean distance between country pairs in the uncertainty and orientation dimensions; for example, Argentina and Mexico have avery close CDI of 0.06, whereas Korea and Nigeria have a nearly polar opposite CDI of 0.92. We then explore whether countries that are more culturally similar—i.e., have a smaller CDI—also annotate game labels more similarly.To determine game label annotation similarity by country pairs,we calculate the Pearson correlation between each country’s post-stratified estimates across games and labels. Specifically, for each game and label combination, we calculate one post-stratified esti-mate of each country’s likelihood of annotating the game with that label (e.g., roughly 60% for the US, for a specific action game with the “high replayability” label, per Figure 2). We then compare esti-mates for “inconsistently” and “consistently” conceptualized labels in aggregate. Hence, for each country, we generate one 55-length vector of “inconsistently conceptualized” game-label annotation estimates, and another vector of the remaining 225 “consistently conceptualized” game-label annotation estimates. For each pair of countries, we calculate the Pearson correlation between their two55-length “inconsistently conceptualized” vectors, and the Pearson Correlation between their two 225-length “consistently conceptual-ized” vectors. The relationship between CDI and label similarity,stratified by label consistency, is plotted in Figure 3.The first takeaway is a confirmation of our definition of “in-consistently conceptualized” labels in subsection 3.2: indeed, the game-label pairs we deem to be consistently conceptualized yield high (often close to perfect) annotation correlation regardless of country pair. Meanwhile, inconsistently conceptualized labels have much lower between-country agreement. The second takeaways that as cultural distance (CDI) increases—that is, cultural simi-larity decreases—game label annotation similarity also decreases.While this is a weak decreasing effect among consistently concep-tualized labels, we in contrast see a stronger negative relationship (slope -0.3, with a weakly negative Spearman correlation of -0.4) for inconsistently conceptualized labels. For example, the culturally close countries of Mexico and Argentina have a perfect annotation correlation of 1.0 for consistently conceptualized labels, and lower but still high correlation of 0.8 for inconsistently conceptualized labels. Meanwhile, the culturally distant countries of Korea andNigeria have a high annotation correlation of 0.9 for consistently conceptualized labels and the lowest (0.0) annotation correlation for inconsistently conceptualized labels.To summarize, we find that the lower the CDI (i.e., the more“culturally similar” a pair of countries are per the Hofstede model),the more similarly respondents from those countries tend to an-notate game labels.

We then estimate the effect of survey language on label annotation using a logistic regression on the matched sample,estimating standard error with cluster-robust variance.Overall, we find that the share of significant survey language effects is slightly higher among inconsistent labels (36%) relatively consistent labels (34%). To showcase the variability in language effects, we turn to another inconsistent label as an example: “makes me feel amused or laugh” for a specific action game.7 In Figure 4,we present the grouped mean differences for individuals annotating a certain action game as such. For demographically matched respondents in Brazil, those surveyed in English had a 21 percentage point lower respondent share answering that the game made them“feel amused or laugh,” relative to being surveyed in Portuguese. Asimilar decrease, though with a larger magnitude and statistically significant, was observed between Polish respondents answering inEnglish (63 percentage points lower) relative to Polish. Meanwhile,for demographically matched respondents in Germany, those sur-veyed in English had a statistically significant 38 percentage point higher respondent share agreeing with the label, relative to being surveyed in German. A similar increase, though not statistically significant, was observed among Mexican respondents answering in English (22 percentage points higher) relative to Spanish.We make several notes on the directions of English language effects on bilingual respondents. First, the English effect is indepen-dent across countries; for a specific label for a specific game, there is no reason to expect that all languages’ translations of that label would consistently yield either all increases, or all decreases, in the probability of annotation relative to English. Second, there is no rea-son that the direction of the English effect must persist across labels for a local language (e.g., there may be some labels that lose mean-ing when translated to that language, but other labels may have no translational difference; furthermore, some label translations may yield a higher probability of label annotation, whereas other label translations may yield a lower probability of label annotation).Third, language-based differences in a label need not persist across games (e.g., if a label—even conceptualized differently—is clearly not relevant to the game being annotated, the language differences may not be as strong).Overall, we find that differences in label translation do contribute in varying degrees to the inconsistent conceptualization of labels across countries, but are highly dependent on both the label itself and the language (as well as, of course, the quality of translation). ",1533-7,"Both uncertainty and orientation dimensions are highly relevant to the labels with which one might annotate video games, where ambiguity, surprise, patience, and reward-seeking behaviors are often key components [45, 52]."
29,CulturalSimilarity,constrainsAgent,XboxUsers,"To illustrate how we examine the consistent conceptualization of labels, we present a case study of video game labels. Game la-bels are not only pertinent for understanding the landscape of the video game industry (forecasted to grow by 50% over the next five years [17]), but also lead to better user experiences on gaming plat-forms [2]. Appropriate game labels allow for more direct searches,and can feed into more accurate recommendation systems for users.We conducted a large-scale survey in the Xbox gaming ecosystem wherein respondents annotated different games using given labels(e.g., “Is [game] an action game?”). Our analysis reveals that we can identify inconsistently conceptualized labels across countries, and we use one such label as a running example throughout the case study. We then present two explanations for why certain labels are inconsistently conceptualized, based on (1) cultural differences and (2) translation differences. Finally, we show that label predic-tions can be improved if trained on a dataset of a heterogeneous global population of annotators rather than a small homogeneous population from a single country.3.1 DataOur analysis is based on an email survey conducted in May-June2022 targeting Xbox gamers. The survey was run in 16 countries:Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Brazil, Germany, Greece, Japan,Poland, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, India, Nigeria, Singapore, SouthAfrica, and the United States. These countries were selected to provide coverage of all distinct regions in the Inglehart–Welzel Cultural Map [35].The survey first allowed the respondent to select which of 11 popular video games they had played in the past year. Then, for the games the respondent selected, they were asked to annotate the game using any of 28 labels presented (such as “action”, “cozy”,etc.). We also collected respondent demographic information such as age, gender, gaming frequency, and gaming device.For respondents in countries where English is not an official lan-guage, the entire survey text was translated to their local language.1 In this process, we performed translation and back-translation by native speakers to ensure translation consistency across lan-guages [8]. We additionally recruited a smaller sample of globalXbox Ambassadors [84]—individuals who are known to be bilingual and opt-in to additional communications from Xbox—to respond to the survey in English; the Xbox Ambassadors were primarily based in the US, Brazil, German, Mexico, and Poland. To summa-rize, all individuals with IP addresses in India, Nigeria, Singapore,South Africa, and the US were served only surveys in English; indi-viduals in all other countries were served surveys either in their local language or—if they are an Xbox Ambassador known to bebilingual—English.In total, we received 5,174 survey responses with complete demo-graphic information; the dominant respondent demographic wasUS-based men in the 25-44 age range, which is reflective of both the demographics of individuals who opt in to receive emails fromXbox, and the selection bias arising from individuals who choose to proactively fill out the survey for no reward. We explore and statistically correct for the respondents’ demographic skew relative to overall gamer populations in subsection 3.2. We begin by examining game labels that are inconsistently concep-tualized across different demographic groups, and to what extent.To do so, we perform multilevel regression and poststratification(MRP) [51, 80] to address the imbalanced nature of our dataset. Wefirst run a Bayesian logistic regression using survey respondents demographic attributes as covariates to generate a distribution of predictions for whether or not a certain label would be anno-tated for each game. Then, the ensuing predictions are weighted via post-stratification to resemble the known joint distribution of age, gender, and country demographics for Xbox players writ large.2 In doing so, our post-stratified estimates of label selection are more accurate over subgroups [62]—specifically, upweighting respondents with smaller sample sizes such as female or non-USrespondents [41, 80]. Note that for the ensuing analyses, we remove respondents from India and Saudi Arabia, as well as non-binary in-dividuals, due to recruiting only 1 or fewer respondents answering the survey for multiple games; however, we comment on extensions of our model to these subgroups in subsection 3.4. We similarly exclude anonymized Game 11 from our analysis due to low survey response rates detailed in Appendix A.As a running example, in Figure 2 we show the post-stratified predictions of the “high replayability” label for each demographic subgroup regarding a certain popular action game (anonymized in this paper). We consider the “high replayability” label for this game to be inconsistently conceptualized per the green line in Figure 2:our model estimates less than a 39% probability that gender- and age-representative Korean gamers would consider the game to be highly replayable; in a majority vote among Koreans, this game would not be given the “high replayability” label. In contrast, we estimate a 59%probability that gender- and age-representative American gamers would consider the game to be highly replayable; in a majority vote among Americans, the game would be labeled with the inverse of the Korean consensus.3 A majority vote would result in this action game being annotated with the “high replayability” label in some countries (Poland, Nigeria, Germany, Colombia, Greece, Mexico,Brazil, and the US), but not it would not be annotated as such in other countries (Korea, Japan, Singapore, South Africa, Chile, andArgentina).In contrast, Figure 2 also presents an example of a consistently conceptualized label, “zen” (red line): all country subgroups—and gender and age subgroups—agree that the action game should not be annotated with this label. We further note that consistent con-ceptualization of labels is dependent on game. For example, the“zen” label is more likely to be consistently conceptualized (and not be annotated) for an action game than, say, a cozy game. As such,we consider inconsistently and consistently conceptualized labels on the basis of game-label pairs (of which there are 280 in total). We Recognize that deciding whether a label is inconsistently concep-tualized is inherently a source of bias, given that the practitioner must decide which subgroups to examine for inconsistency, and what threshold cutoffs are relevant. While we cannot provide a one-size-fits-all formal mathematical definition for inconsistent conceptualization for all domains, we use this terminology to describe labels that have high variance across and within demographic subgroups, and when the subgroup mean straddles the 50% mark for binary labels. For the ensuing analyses in this paper, we categorize 55 game-label pairs as “in-consistently conceptualized” labels, having cross-country standard deviations greater than 0.05 among post-stratified estimates (calcu-lated from the “Country” facet of Figure 2) and with post-stratified country-level estimates both over and under the majority 50% line.Cross-country standard deviations for our surveyed labels and anonymized games are presented in Figure 10 in Appendix D.Our designation of inconsistent labels is robust across reasonable definitions. The post-stratified estimates presented in Figure 2 are similar to the unweighted raw survey results (Figure 7 in Appen-dix B), indicating that our survey respondent pool is reflective of the true underlying gamer demographic distribution from which we sampled.4Our case study focuses on the inconsistent conceptualizations across countries, where there tends to be higher variance across game labels relative to age- or gender-groups of label annotations. For example, in the “high replayability” example in Figure 2, we see a 20-percentage-point spread of estimates across countries versus a roughly 10-percentage-point spread of estimates by gender. We Now turn to understanding why country-level differences arise. We present two explanations for the country-level differences in label conceptualization across our surveyed labels. The first invokes cultural frameworks from the sociology literature, and the second involves semantic differences in language translations.3.3.1 Cultural Distances. Much prior work has been conducted across sociology to measure cross-cultural similarities via indices,including the World Value Survey [35] used for our country se-lection process per Section 3.1, and the Hofstede Model of Cul-ture [32]. The Hofstede Model of Culture consists of six dimensions of national cultures (developed over the course of 1991 [32] to2010 [7, 33]): power distance, uncertainty avoidance, individual-ism/collectivism, masculinity/feminity, long/short-term orientation and indulgence/restraints. Each country is mapped to six numeric indices ranging from 0 to 100%.First, we generate a Cultural Distance Index based on the subset of Hofstede dimensions that we hypothesize can explain different countries' label annotations. To determine which dimensions are relevant, we run a logistic regression similar to subsection 3.2 across all survey responses on all games and labels, but replace the country categorical covariate with the six Hofstede dimensions. We find that the coefficients on two dimensions are significant at the p < 0.001level and have the highest magnitude of all dimensions; these two dimensions are “uncertainty” and “orientation” (regression results are presented in Table 3 in Appendix C).5The uncertainty Hofstede dimension is based on the concept of “uncertainty avoidance,” defined as “the extent to which the members of a culture feel threatened by ambiguous or unknown situations” [32] under the premise that “extreme ambiguity creates intolerable anxiety.” Hofstede’s uncertainty dimension measures how much or little a society copes with anxiety by minimizing uncertainty (a high Hofstede uncertainty dimension indicates low tolerance for uncertainty). This is considered a proxy for the threat of change to a culture. Meanwhile, the orientation Hofstede dimen-sion is on the spectrum between short-term and long-term orienta-tion. Short-term orientation is defined as “the fostering of virtues related to the past and present—in particular, respect for tradition,preservation of ‘face,’ and fulfilling social obligations”; meanwhile,long-term orientation is defined as “the fostering of virtues oriented towards future rewards—in particular, perseverance and thrift.” [32]. Both uncertainty and orientation dimensions are highly relevant to the labels with which one might annotate video games, where ambiguity, surprise, patience, and reward-seeking behaviors are often key components [45, 52].We hence calculate a Cultural Distance Index (CDI) defined as theEuclidean distance between country pairs in the uncertainty and orientation dimensions; for example, Argentina and Mexico have avery close CDI of 0.06, whereas Korea and Nigeria have a nearly polar opposite CDI of 0.92. We then explore whether countries that are more culturally similar—i.e., have a smaller CDI—also annotate game labels more similarly.To determine game label annotation similarity by country pairs,we calculate the Pearson correlation between each country’s post-stratified estimates across games and labels. Specifically, for each game and label combination, we calculate one post-stratified esti-mate of each country’s likelihood of annotating the game with that label (e.g., roughly 60% for the US, for a specific action game with the “high replayability” label, per Figure 2). We then compare esti-mates for “inconsistently” and “consistently” conceptualized labels in aggregate. Hence, for each country, we generate one 55-length vector of “inconsistently conceptualized” game-label annotation estimates, and another vector of the remaining 225 “consistently conceptualized” game-label annotation estimates. For each pair of countries, we calculate the Pearson correlation between their two55-length “inconsistently conceptualized” vectors, and the Pearson Correlation between their two 225-length “consistently conceptual-ized” vectors. The relationship between CDI and label similarity,stratified by label consistency, is plotted in Figure 3.The first takeaway is a confirmation of our definition of “in-consistently conceptualized” labels in subsection 3.2: indeed, the game-label pairs we deem to be consistently conceptualized yield high (often close to perfect) annotation correlation regardless of country pair. Meanwhile, inconsistently conceptualized labels have much lower between-country agreement. The second takeaways that as cultural distance (CDI) increases—that is, cultural simi-larity decreases—game label annotation similarity also decreases.While this is a weak decreasing effect among consistently concep-tualized labels, we in contrast see a stronger negative relationship (slope -0.3, with a weakly negative Spearman correlation of -0.4) for inconsistently conceptualized labels. For example, the culturally close countries of Mexico and Argentina have a perfect annotation correlation of 1.0 for consistently conceptualized labels, and lower but still high correlation of 0.8 for inconsistently conceptualized labels. Meanwhile, the culturally distant countries of Korea andNigeria have a high annotation correlation of 0.9 for consistently conceptualized labels and the lowest (0.0) annotation correlation for inconsistently conceptualized labels.To summarize, we find that the lower the CDI (i.e., the more“culturally similar” a pair of countries are per the Hofstede model),the more similarly respondents from those countries tend to an-notate game labels. While we cannot draw concrete causal con-clusions from specific cultural differences to general game-label conceptualization consistency, we do find that culture may play a non-negligible role in understanding country-based differences in game label annotations.3.3.2 Lost in Translation. In addition to modeling culture, an-other explanation for inconsistently conceptualized labels across countries lies in the label text itself. Translation to a different lan-guage can lead to the loss of semantic precision [67, 75], even if professionally translated, due to the fundamental difference in cul-tural conceptualization of a word. To determine whether language itself has an impact on game label annotations within a country,we compare respondents surveyed in English to a demographically-similar set of respondents surveyed in their local language, usingMahalanobis distance matching [13, 53, 72]. To ensure we capture differences in semantics and not differences in player experience,we subset to respondents who play games in English “frequently” or even more often. We then match the Xbox ambassadors (surveyed in English) to their compatriots (surveyed in their local language)on dimensions of age, gender, and gaming experience.6 Covariate balance was confirmed between the English and local survey language respondents (balance plots are reported in Figure 8 inAppendix C).

Second, there is no rea-son that the direction of the English effect must persist across labels for a local language (e.g., there may be some labels that lose mean-ing when translated to that language, but other labels may have no translational difference; furthermore, some label translations may yield a higher probability of label annotation, whereas other label translations may yield a lower probability of label annotation).Third, language-based differences in a label need not persist across games (e.g., if a label—even conceptualized differently—is clearly not relevant to the game being annotated, the language differences may not be as strong).Overall, we find that differences in label translation do contribute in varying degrees to the inconsistent conceptualization of labels across countries, but are highly dependent on both the label itself and the language (as well as, of course, the quality of translation). ",1533-7,"translation to a different language can lead to the loss of semantic precision [67, 75], even if professionally translated, due to the fundamental difference in cultural conceptualization of a word."
