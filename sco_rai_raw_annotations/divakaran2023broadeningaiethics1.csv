9,NeedToReconcileOpinions,Perceived_Problem,"Can the Indian arts shed light on new forms of participatory approaches that can be useful in the AI pipeline? In order to analyze this RQ, in our interview, we had included questions concerning how artists collaborate with co-artists and accommodate their views to achieve harmony in their renditions,how they are able to reconcile contradicting opinions with their co-artists, how they cater to the requirements of diverse audience, how they adapt to changing times, and the extent of freedom they have in interpreting the art works of other artists. Below, we summarize the responses to these questions. In response to the question concerning reconciliation of contradicting opinions (which often becomes necessary in settings involving stakeholders with differing requirements such as in an AI pipeline), one participant cited the example of the proliferation of Harihara sculptures from the 5ùë°‚Ñé century onwards and mentioned that often art was seen as a vehicle to transcend differences. The participant mentioned that the Harihara sculptures are indicative of the forces of fusion and syncretism in the Indian society. Ontologically, Harihara signifies that there is no metaphysical difference between the two principal divinities of Hinduism -Vishnu (Hari)and Shiva (Hara). Epistemologically, it represents the idea that d-versity emerges from unity before merging itself into unity again. Another example of syncretism given by the participant concerned a medieval sculpture at the Indian Museum in Kolkata which represents Harihara flanked by Buddha and Surya. In this, a single sculpture combines the four most important philosophies ‚Äì Saiva,Bhagvata, Saura, and Saugata. Adding to the aforementioned line of thought, another partici-pant quoted the Sanskrit phrase ‚Äòspardhaaya vardhate vidya‚Äô, which roughly means competition enhances knowledge. Elaborating on this point, the participant said that understanding the benefits of complementary viewpoints helps in convergence of divergent artforms, and in turn, helps in presenting a collaborative performance as one aesthetic entity. In response to a question concerning how knowing about other art forms helps an artist to be more creative and accommodate other art forms, one participant said that being aware of multiple art forms and immersing oneself in various art forms to the extent possible,enhances accommodation. A few other participants mentioned that various art forms are intrinsically interconnected and an awareness of the same can help them in engaging creatively with their co-artists. Elaborating this point by taking the example of music based art forms, one participant mentioned that Indian music reflects the metaphysical idea at the heart of Indian philosophy which is that humans are all fragmented parts of a whole, ultimately united as one. According to the participant, this makes one approach music as a means to understand this oneness rather than merely as individual expressions of creativity. The participant added that this attempt at connectivity can be seen in the Raga/tala system of Indian music,which is connected to nature and the environment, and ultimately to the essence of the universe. The participant gave the example of ‚Äòsvaras‚Äô in Indian music which refer to the musical notes on an octave, which are believed to have origins in the music of animals(notes: Re, Ga, Dha, Ni) and birds (notes Sa, Ma and Pa).In response to a question concerning the extent of freedom artists have in interpreting works of other artists and incorporating the same in their renditions, one participant mentioned that respect to the values of the original works is imperative. Another participant said interpreting an art piece necessitates an analysis of the literal meaning and context of the piece, the cultural, philosophical and ideological leanings of the artist, the socio-political context, the layers of meaning in the art composition like the ‚ÄòPadartha‚Äô or the literal meaning, ‚ÄòVakyartha‚Äô or the grammatical embeddings, ‚ÄòGud-hartha‚Äô or the hidden meaning, ‚ÄòVisheshartha‚Äô or the nuanced higher meaning, the symbolism, imagery, and the sub texts. The partici-pant mentioned that all these put together helps in understanding the totality of the art piece.In response to a question that asked how artists adapt to chang-ing times, one participant quoted one of India‚Äôs oldest poets Kali-dasa who says ‚Äòpuranamityeva na sadhu sarvam, na chaapi kavyamnavamitya vadhyam‚Äô, a Sanskrit verse which means not everything ancient is always good and not everything modern is bad. The participant mentioned that artists have twin responsibilities - to cater to the changing aesthetic sensibilities of the connoisseurs and secondly to mould the aesthetics of the audience and raise their standards of understanding the underlying values and beauty. This twin purpose should probably serve AI systems well too. All artists have to adapt to changing times and even react to change. One participant observed that the arts, particularly performing arts, cannot or should not freeze in time. The tradition becomes the unchanging core which gives the artist the capability to face changes. The participant said that while modern tools and technologies can be helpful in furthering traditions and traditional art forms, the disruption can be caused only by the user, not the times or the changes it brings to the situation. Another participant said the way in which art can both embrace and shock diverse audiences is an important metaphor for how AI could be designed. The participant said a lot of AI technologies today facilitate the creation of bubbles - echo chambers of niche interests and ideologies, and added that AI must move away from identifying and grouping similar subsets, but should open new ways at looking at the world. They said that an AI system should act like a friend in school who was a tastemaker, who was not interested in recommending music that the respondent liked, but instead would deliberately throw in something that one had never heard before and thereby open one‚Äôs mind to new experiences. An oft quoted metaphor is that of the wheel, where the core at the center is fixed but the rim moves on. Most of the partic-ipants subscribed to this notion of the continuity of the artistic tradition through changing times. This characteristic of continuous adaptability without annihilation of diverse values is also needed in AI systems. Adaptability is thus a cumulative process that syn-chronously blends diverse principles in a gradual manner so as to accommodate change while maintaining continuity, which can be valuable in enhancing robustness of AI systems. Based on the above responses, it can be inferred that recognizing and respecting subjective viewpoints is an essential requisite in any participatory framework. It is important to note that subjec-tive viewpoints are inherently dynamic: they vary from person to person, place to place, and time to time. Thus, incorporation of subjective viewpoints can enhance the applicability of AI systems. Further, understanding the broader socio-cultural settings of a prob-lem, understanding domain-specific requirements and challenges,and striving for harmony even in presence of differing stakeholder opinions can therefore be useful participatory paradigms to con-sider in the AI pipeline.",6-7,reconciliation of contradicting opinions (which often becomes necessary in settings involving stakeholders with differing requirements [...]),

In response to a question concerning how knowing about other art forms helps an artist to be more creative and accommodate other art forms, one participant said that being aware of multiple art forms and immersing oneself in various art forms to the extent possible,enhances accommodation. A few other participants mentioned that various art forms are intrinsically interconnected and an awareness of the same can help them in engaging creatively with their co-artists. Elaborating this point by taking the example of music based art forms, one participant mentioned that Indian music reflects the metaphysical idea at the heart of Indian philosophy which is that humans are all fragmented parts of a whole, ultimately united as one. According to the participant, this makes one approach music as a means to understand this oneness rather than merely as individual expressions of creativity. The participant added that this attempt at connectivity can be seen in the Raga/tala system of Indian music,which is connected to nature and the environment, and ultimately to the essence of the universe. The participant gave the example of ‚Äòsvaras‚Äô in Indian music which refer to the musical notes on an octave, which are believed to have origins in the music of animals(notes: Re, Ga, Dha, Ni) and birds (notes Sa, Ma and Pa).In response to a question concerning the extent of freedom artists have in interpreting works of other artists and incorporating the same in their renditions, one participant mentioned that respect to the values of the original works is imperative. Another participant said interpreting an art piece necessitates an analysis of the literal meaning and context of the piece, the cultural, philosophical and ideological leanings of the artist, the socio-political context, the layers of meaning in the art composition like the ‚ÄòPadartha‚Äô or the literal meaning, ‚ÄòVakyartha‚Äô or the grammatical embeddings, ‚ÄòGud-hartha‚Äô or the hidden meaning, ‚ÄòVisheshartha‚Äô or the nuanced higher meaning, the symbolism, imagery, and the sub texts. The partici-pant mentioned that all these put together helps in understanding the totality of the art piece.In response to a question that asked how artists adapt to chang-ing times, one participant quoted one of India‚Äôs oldest poets Kali-dasa who says ‚Äòpuranamityeva na sadhu sarvam, na chaapi kavyamnavamitya vadhyam‚Äô, a Sanskrit verse which means not everything ancient is always good and not everything modern is bad. The participant mentioned that artists have twin responsibilities - to cater to the changing aesthetic sensibilities of the connoisseurs and secondly to mould the aesthetics of the audience and raise their standards of understanding the underlying values and beauty. This twin purpose should probably serve AI systems well too. All artists have to adapt to changing times and even react to change. One participant observed that the arts, particularly performing arts, cannot or should not freeze in time. The tradition becomes the unchanging core which gives the artist the capability to face changes. The participant said that while modern tools and technologies can be helpful in furthering traditions and traditional art forms, the disruption can be caused only by the user, not the times or the changes it brings to the situation. Another participant said the way in which art can both embrace and shock diverse audiences is an important metaphor for how AI could be designed. The participant said a lot of AI technologies today facilitate the creation of bubbles - echo chambers of niche interests and ideologies, and added that AI must move away from identifying and grouping similar subsets, but should open new ways at looking at the world. They said that an AI system should act like a friend in school who was a tastemaker, who was not interested in recommending music that the respondent liked, but instead would deliberately throw in something that one had never heard before and thereby open one‚Äôs mind to new experiences. An oft quoted metaphor is that of the wheel, where the core at the center is fixed but the rim moves on. Most of the partic-ipants subscribed to this notion of the continuity of the artistic tradition through changing times. This characteristic of continuous adaptability without annihilation of diverse values is also needed in AI systems. Adaptability is thus a cumulative process that syn-chronously blends diverse principles in a gradual manner so as to accommodate change while maintaining continuity, which can be valuable in enhancing robustness of AI systems. Based on the above responses, it can be inferred that recognizing and respecting subjective viewpoints is an essential requisite in any participatory framework. It is important to note that subjec-tive viewpoints are inherently dynamic: they vary from person to person, place to place, and time to time. Thus, incorporation of subjective viewpoints can enhance the applicability of AI systems.

15,Disruption,Artifact,"Can the Indian arts shed light on new forms of participatory approaches that can be useful in the AI pipeline? In order to analyze this RQ, in our interview, we had included questions concerning how artists collaborate with co-artists and accommodate their views to achieve harmony in their renditions,how they are able to reconcile contradicting opinions with their co-artists, how they cater to the requirements of diverse audience, how they adapt to changing times, and the extent of freedom they have in interpreting the art works of other artists. Below, we summarize the responses to these questions. In response to the question concerning reconciliation of contradicting opinions (which often becomes necessary in settings involving stakeholders with differing requirements such as in an AI pipeline), one participant cited the example of the proliferation of Harihara sculptures from the 5ùë°‚Ñé century onwards and mentioned that often art was seen as a vehicle to transcend differences. The participant mentioned that the Harihara sculptures are indicative of the forces of fusion and syncretism in the Indian society.

Epistemologically, it represents the idea that d-versity emerges from unity before merging itself into unity again.

Another participant said interpreting an art piece necessitates an analysis of the literal meaning and context of the piece, the cultural, philosophical and ideological leanings of the artist, the socio-political context, the layers of meaning in the art composition like the ‚ÄòPadartha‚Äô or the literal meaning, ‚ÄòVakyartha‚Äô or the grammatical embeddings, ‚ÄòGud-hartha‚Äô or the hidden meaning, ‚ÄòVisheshartha‚Äô or the nuanced higher meaning, the symbolism, imagery, and the sub texts. The partici-pant mentioned that all these put together helps in understanding the totality of the art piece.In response to a question that asked how artists adapt to chang-ing times, one participant quoted one of India‚Äôs oldest poets Kali-dasa who says ‚Äòpuranamityeva na sadhu sarvam, na chaapi kavyamnavamitya vadhyam‚Äô, a Sanskrit verse which means not everything ancient is always good and not everything modern is bad. The participant mentioned that artists have twin responsibilities - to cater to the changing aesthetic sensibilities of the connoisseurs and secondly to mould the aesthetics of the audience and raise their standards of understanding the underlying values and beauty. This twin purpose should probably serve AI systems well too. All artists have to adapt to changing times and even react to change. One participant observed that the arts, particularly performing arts, cannot or should not freeze in time. The tradition becomes the unchanging core which gives the artist the capability to face changes. The participant said that while modern tools and technologies can be helpful in furthering traditions and traditional art forms, the disruption can be caused only by the user, not the times or the changes it brings to the situation. Another participant said the way in which art can both embrace and shock diverse audiences is an important metaphor for how AI could be designed. The participant said a lot of AI technologies today facilitate the creation of bubbles - echo chambers of niche interests and ideologies, and added that AI must move away from identifying and grouping similar subsets, but should open new ways at looking at the world. They said that an AI system should act like a friend in school who was a tastemaker, who was not interested in recommending music that the respondent liked, but instead would deliberately throw in something that one had never heard before and thereby open one‚Äôs mind to new experiences. An oft quoted metaphor is that of the wheel, where the core at the center is fixed but the rim moves on. Most of the partic-ipants subscribed to this notion of the continuity of the artistic tradition through changing times. This characteristic of continuous adaptability without annihilation of diverse values is also needed in AI systems. Adaptability is thus a cumulative process that syn-chronously blends diverse principles in a gradual manner so as to accommodate change while maintaining continuity, which can be valuable in enhancing robustness of AI systems. Based on the above responses, it can be inferred that recognizing and respecting subjective viewpoints is an essential requisite in any participatory framework. It is important to note that subjec-tive viewpoints are inherently dynamic: they vary from person to person, place to place, and time to time. Thus, incorporation of subjective viewpoints can enhance the applicability of AI systems.

31,AI,hasProducedArtifact,EchoChambers,"Can the Indian arts shed light on new forms of participatory approaches that can be useful in the AI pipeline? In order to analyze this RQ, in our interview, we had included questions concerning how artists collaborate with co-artists and accommodate their views to achieve harmony in their renditions,how they are able to reconcile contradicting opinions with their co-artists, how they cater to the requirements of diverse audience, how they adapt to changing times, and the extent of freedom they have in interpreting the art works of other artists. Below, we summarize the responses to these questions. In response to the question concerning reconciliation of contradicting opinions (which often becomes necessary in settings involving stakeholders with differing requirements such as in an AI pipeline), one participant cited the example of the proliferation of Harihara sculptures from the 5ùë°‚Ñé century onwards and mentioned that often art was seen as a vehicle to transcend differences. The participant mentioned that the Harihara sculptures are indicative of the forces of fusion and syncretism in the Indian society. Ontologically, Harihara signifies that there is no metaphysical difference between the two principal divinities of Hinduism -Vishnu (Hari)and Shiva (Hara). Epistemologically, it represents the idea that d-versity emerges from unity before merging itself into unity again. Another example of syncretism given by the participant concerned a medieval sculpture at the Indian Museum in Kolkata which represents Harihara flanked by Buddha and Surya. In this, a single sculpture combines the four most important philosophies ‚Äì Saiva,Bhagvata, Saura, and Saugata. Adding to the aforementioned line of thought, another partici-pant quoted the Sanskrit phrase ‚Äòspardhaaya vardhate vidya‚Äô, which roughly means competition enhances knowledge. Elaborating on this point, the participant said that understanding the benefits of complementary viewpoints helps in convergence of divergent artforms, and in turn, helps in presenting a collaborative performance as one aesthetic entity. In response to a question concerning how knowing about other art forms helps an artist to be more creative and accommodate other art forms, one participant said that being aware of multiple art forms and immersing oneself in various art forms to the extent possible,enhances accommodation. A few other participants mentioned that various art forms are intrinsically interconnected and an awareness of the same can help them in engaging creatively with their co-artists. Elaborating this point by taking the example of music based art forms, one participant mentioned that Indian music reflects the metaphysical idea at the heart of Indian philosophy which is that humans are all fragmented parts of a whole, ultimately united as one. According to the participant, this makes one approach music as a means to understand this oneness rather than merely as individual expressions of creativity. The participant added that this attempt at connectivity can be seen in the Raga/tala system of Indian music,which is connected to nature and the environment, and ultimately to the essence of the universe.
