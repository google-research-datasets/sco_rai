9,WarehouseWorkers,Agent,"Example 1 focuses on the conditions of labor and work at a company that is active in setting a global standard, and with which many of us are implicated through every-day practices of consumption: Amazon fulfillment centers. These Are sites about which Alessandro Delfanti notes there is an entire genre of journalism, with a growing corpus of activist and academic attention [71-74]. It is from this this documentation—by journal-ists, activists, and academics—that a depiction of warehouse workemerges.Workers in Amazon fulfillment centers do two main things: stock products to be picked and pick products to be shipped. Warehouse Processes are billed as ‘smart’ and ‘efficient,’ driven by always-learning systems that advance and govern based on data from consumer purchases, employees’ bodily movements, time sensors, heat sensors, video monitors, product scanners, curated employee feed-back, targeted employee monitoring, customer feedback, delivery feedback, and managements’ evaluations calibrated to corporate-designated metrics. These data produce algorithms that hire and fire, that set and display countdown timers for increasingly granular tasks, that extend or shorten shifts, dictate how when and where employees move within the warehouse, and that punish employees who are out of synch, too slow, too stagnant, dissatisfied, orunion-inclined. The warehouse also pairs workers with automated systems in an extractive relationship, whereby workers train the synthetic forms designed for human displacement. In a general sense, then, we observe a form of data-based and mechanized governance that deskills and denigrates. How and for whom is clarified with an operationalized affordance lens. For example, these data driven systems demand discretization and au-tomation of warehouse tasks, making knowledge and experience relevant, even a liability, thus allowing management to not only monitor, but also easily discipline and replace workers, while requesting workers move and use their bodies within tightly prescribed choreographies—discouraging (or refusing) embodiment that are ill, disabled, aged, or tired. Management, too, become replaceable and acquiescent, moored to systems that demand attention to metrics, discourage and in some cases refuse skilled and subjective decision making, and request, at multiple levels, service to corporate goals, even when those goals conflict with workers and managers’ labor (and human) interests. Moreover, neither managers nor workers have the cultural and institutional legitimacy, a condition of affordance, to alter, reprogram, or recalibrate system properties, thus refusing agentic input over the very infrastructures that mandate bodily and temporal compliance. Table 2 displays the affordance analysis by which these contentions derive.3.1.2 Reconfiguring Warehouse Standards. To be sure, there are acts of resistance to the mechanized control occurring within Ama-zon’s warehouses. Recall that affordances shape but do not deter-mine, social and behavioral outcomes. Workers ignore their count-down timers, place objects in unfindable slots, choose not to scan items, and engage in union organizing. This comes at a cost, but it isn't entirely refused. That is, the affordances of the fulfillment center request and encourage compliance and control, but with fracture points that allow labor pushback. Even with these flashes of resis-tance, however, the default remains exploitative and dehumanizing.From a design perspective, the challenge of addressing the Amazon model is thus in altering its defaults, creating instead a workplace that supports and insists on human dignity [75-77]—reconfiguring socio-material conditions to respect, compensate, and value the bodies, lives, and labor of workers. The mechanisms and conditions framework can help with this task, too. Here I suggest three specific proposals that align with calls from labor organizers.These proposals reimagine the data-driven warehouse system in ef-forts to detach the surveillant lens, loosen temporal constraints, and enhance worker autonomy in ways that acknowledge and respect employees as whole human beings. Proposals and their relevant affordances are depicted in Table 3One proposal is to depersonalize tracking within the warehouse,shifting the surveillant lens onto items exclusively, rather than people. At present, each worker is electronically logged upon entering the warehouse for a shift, followed through the warehouse by sensors that attach to employee badges with unique identifiers,and then further tracked when signing into a handheld scanner which stays with them throughout the shift. This scanner is how employees document the products they stock, pick, and pack, but itis also how management tracks and communicates with individual employees while on site. Workers are monitored throughout the warehouse, into the breakroom, the restroom, the corridors, and the parking lot, with accumulated data about how they do each taskand the summative time they spend ‘off task’. Such a system refuses worker privacy, demands surveillance, encourages real-time correc-tion and related punitive measures, and thus requests worker pas-sivity and compliance, while discouraging basic human needs like bathroom breaks and sitting. An alternative configuration might untie tracking from individual employees, dismantling badge read-ers and altering scanner sign-ins to a generic employee ID. Datawould thus pertain to the collective rather than the individual, mon-itoring product flows but not monitoring people. This alternative,generalized mode of tracking would refuse individualized micro-surveillance and attendant micro-management, encouraging logistic efficiency without demanding dehumanizing control.A second proposal is the removal of time rates altogether, or recalculation of rates to inbuild excess time, rather than trimming to its strictest edge. Rates dictate how quickly each item should be stocked, picked, and/or packed, and correspond to an ever-restarting countdown clock flashing at workers from handheld scanners. These clocks demand attention to pace, encourage speed over safety, and are automated in a way that refuses shutdown,slowdown, or adjustment by those judged and governed by tem-poral displays and the urgency these displays communicate. Such Affordances are especially onerous for workers with elder bodies,ill bodies, disabled bodies, injured bodies, tired bodies, and those on temporary contracts whose livelihood can be cut if too many countdown clocks time out. Removing (or revamping) these rates,and the clocks that express them, would instead allow for variation in speed of movement that aligns with the diversity of bodies who do warehouse work, encouraging safety and the occasional friendly workplace conversation in lieu of anxious and tightly monitored temporal parameters.The third proposal is simple: reconfigure scheduling algorithms to set employee timetables two-weeks out and require human in-tervention from management plus a non-punitive approval process 1https://www.amazon labor union.org/from employees if these timetables change. The company could also pool and centralize hours so that employees can pick up, drop,and trade shifts, as suits. Amazon currently uses automated sched-uling tools that predict customer demand and related staffing needs.These tools continue to update in real-time, cutting shifts or addinghours with little notice and no meaningful employee recourse. This system thus discourages a work-life balance for employees, request-ing an always-on, always available relationship to the workplace,while allowing management to practice ‘just in time’ staffing. The Alternative proposal requests a degree of stability and commitment from management in the scheduling protocol by creating friction to its alteration, while encouraging empowered employees who can attend to and adjust for their own scheduling preferences and income needs. This alternative system refuses rigid asymmetries between management and workers and demands respect for workers as whole human beings with lives beyond the warehouse walls.Note that these proposals boil down to not collecting data, collectingless data, or collecting different data and using it more respectfully. I am therefore not suggesting complex models or elegant algorithms, but simple adjustments derived from the labor movements bubbling within Amazon's Warehouse sector, operationalized here through an affordance lens. These Proposals are of course aspirational. Amazon, and Big Capital in general,are programmed to extract. But imagining what could be, in concrete terms,sets a standard for debate. This serves the efforts of collective resistance,articulating a version of reality that corporate interests and the legislators who regulate them, must contend with and contest. In other words, to build the worlds we ought, first we must conceive of them and render those worlds legible.",527-8,Workers in Amazon fulfillment centers,

Workers are monitored throughout the warehouse, into the breakroom, the restroom, the corridors, and the parking lot, with accumulated data about how they do each taskand the summative time they spend ‘off task’. Such a system refuses worker privacy, demands surveillance, encourages real-time correc-tion and related punitive measures, and thus requests worker pas-sivity and compliance, while discouraging basic human needs like bathroom breaks and sitting. An alternative configuration might untie tracking from individual employees, dismantling badge read-ers and altering scanner sign-ins to a generic employee ID. Datawould thus pertain to the collective rather than the individual, mon-itoring product flows but not monitoring people. This alternative,generalized mode of tracking would refuse individualized micro-surveillance and attendant micro-management, encouraging logistic efficiency without demanding dehumanizing control.A second proposal is the removal of time rates altogether, or recalculation of rates to inbuild excess time, rather than trimming to its strictest edge. Rates dictate how quickly each item should be stocked, picked, and/or packed, and correspond to an ever-restarting countdown clock flashing at workers from handheld scanners. These clocks demand attention to pace, encourage speed over safety, and are automated in a way that refuses shutdown,slowdown, or adjustment by those judged and governed by tem-poral displays and the urgency these displays communicate. Such Affordances are especially onerous for workers with elder bodies,ill bodies, disabled bodies, injured bodies, tired bodies, and those on temporary contracts whose livelihood can be cut if too many countdown clocks time out. Removing (or revamping) these rates,and the clocks that express them, would instead allow for variation in speed of movement that aligns with the diversity of bodies who do warehouse work, encouraging safety and the occasional friendly workplace conversation in lieu of anxious and tightly monitored temporal parameters.The third proposal is simple: reconfigure scheduling algorithms to set employee timetables two-weeks out and require human in-tervention from management plus a non-punitive approval process 1https://www.amazon labor union.org/from employees if these timetables change. The company could also pool and centralize hours so that employees can pick up, drop,and trade shifts, as suits. Amazon currently uses automated sched-uling tools that predict customer demand and related staffing needs.These tools continue to update in real-time, cutting shifts or addinghours with little notice and no meaningful employee recourse. This system thus discourages a work-life balance for employees, request-ing an always-on, always available relationship to the workplace,while allowing management to practice ‘just in time’ staffing. The Alternative proposal requests a degree of stability and commitment from management in the scheduling protocol by creating friction to its alteration, while encouraging empowered employees who can attend to and adjust for their own scheduling preferences and income needs. This alternative system refuses rigid asymmetries between management and workers and demands respect for workers as whole human beings with lives beyond the warehouse walls.Note that these proposals boil down to not collecting data, collectingless data, or collecting different data and using it more respectfully. I am therefore not suggesting complex models or elegant algorithms, but simple adjustments derived from the labor movements bubbling within Amazon's Warehouse sector, operationalized here through an affordance lens. These Proposals are of course aspirational. Amazon, and Big Capital in general,are programmed to extract. But imagining what could be, in concrete terms,sets a standard for debate.

These Are sites about which Alessandro Delfanti notes there is an entire genre of journalism, with a growing corpus of activist and academic attention [71-74]. It is from this this documentation—by journal-ists, activists, and academics—that a depiction of warehouse workemerges.Workers in Amazon fulfillment centers do two main things: stock products to be picked and pick products to be shipped. Warehouse Processes are billed as ‘smart’ and ‘efficient,’ driven by always-learning systems that advance and govern based on data from consumer purchases, employees’ bodily movements, time sensors, heat sensors, video monitors, product scanners, curated employee feed-back, targeted employee monitoring, customer feedback, delivery feedback, and managements’ evaluations calibrated to corporate-designated metrics. These data produce algorithms that hire and fire, that set and display countdown timers for increasingly granular tasks, that extend or shorten shifts, dictate how when and where employees move within the warehouse, and that punish employees who are out of synch, too slow, too stagnant, dissatisfied, orunion-inclined. The warehouse also pairs workers with automated systems in an extractive relationship, whereby workers train the synthetic forms designed for human displacement. In a general sense, then, we observe a form of data-based and mechanized governance that deskills and denigrates. How and for whom is clarified with an operationalized affordance lens. For example, these data driven systems demand discretization and au-tomation of warehouse tasks, making knowledge and experience relevant, even a liability, thus allowing management to not only monitor, but also easily discipline and replace workers, while requesting workers move and use their bodies within tightly prescribed choreographies—discouraging (or refusing) embodiment that are ill, disabled, aged, or tired. Management, too, become replaceable and acquiescent, moored to systems that demand attention to metrics, discourage and in some cases refuse skilled and subjective decision making, and request, at multiple levels, service to corporate goals, even when those goals conflict with workers and managers’ labor (and human) interests. Moreover, neither managers nor workers have the cultural and institutional legitimacy, a condition of affordance, to alter, reprogram, or recalibrate system properties, thus refusing agentic input over the very infrastructures that mandate bodily and temporal compliance. Table 2 displays the affordance analysis by which these contentions derive.3.1.2 Reconfiguring Warehouse Standards. To be sure, there are acts of resistance to the mechanized control occurring within Ama-zon’s warehouses. Recall that affordances shape but do not deter-mine, social and behavioral outcomes. Workers ignore their count-down timers, place objects in unfindable slots, choose not to scan items, and engage in union organizing. This comes at a cost, but it isn't entirely refused. That is, the affordances of the fulfillment center request and encourage compliance and control, but with fracture points that allow labor pushback. Even with these flashes of resis-tance, however, the default remains exploitative and dehumanizing.From a design perspective, the challenge of addressing the Amazon model is thus in altering its defaults, creating instead a workplace that supports and insists on human dignity [75-77]—reconfiguring socio-material conditions to respect, compensate, and value the bodies, lives, and labor of workers. The mechanisms and conditions framework can help with this task, too. Here I suggest three specific proposals that align with calls from labor organizers.These proposals reimagine the data-driven warehouse system in ef-forts to detach the surveillant lens, loosen temporal constraints, and enhance worker autonomy in ways that acknowledge and respect employees as whole human beings.

It is from this this documentation—by journal-ists, activists, and academics—that a depiction of warehouse workemerges.Workers in Amazon fulfillment centers do two main things: stock products to be picked and pick products to be shipped. Warehouse Processes are billed as ‘smart’ and ‘efficient,’ driven by always-learning systems that advance and govern based on data from consumer purchases, employees’ bodily movements, time sensors, heat sensors, video monitors, product scanners, curated employee feed-back, targeted employee monitoring, customer feedback, delivery feedback, and managements’ evaluations calibrated to corporate-designated metrics. These data produce algorithms that hire and fire, that set and display countdown timers for increasingly granular tasks, that extend or shorten shifts, dictate how when and where employees move within the warehouse, and that punish employees who are out of synch, too slow, too stagnant, dissatisfied, orunion-inclined. The warehouse also pairs workers with automated systems in an extractive relationship, whereby workers train the synthetic forms designed for human displacement. In a general sense, then, we observe a form of data-based and mechanized governance that deskills and denigrates. How and for whom is clarified with an operationalized affordance lens. For example, these data driven systems demand discretization and au-tomation of warehouse tasks, making knowledge and experience relevant, even a liability, thus allowing management to not only monitor, but also easily discipline and replace workers, while requesting workers move and use their bodies within tightly prescribed choreographies—discouraging (or refusing) embodiment that are ill, disabled, aged, or tired. Management, too, become replaceable and acquiescent, moored to systems that demand attention to metrics, discourage and in some cases refuse skilled and subjective decision making, and request, at multiple levels, service to corporate goals, even when those goals conflict with workers and managers’ labor (and human) interests. Moreover, neither managers nor workers have the cultural and institutional legitimacy, a condition of affordance, to alter, reprogram, or recalibrate system properties, thus refusing agentic input over the very infrastructures that mandate bodily and temporal compliance. Table 2 displays the affordance analysis by which these contentions derive.3.1.2 Reconfiguring Warehouse Standards. To be sure, there are acts of resistance to the mechanized control occurring within Ama-zon’s warehouses. Recall that affordances shape but do not deter-mine, social and behavioral outcomes. Workers ignore their count-down timers, place objects in unfindable slots, choose not to scan items, and engage in union organizing. This comes at a cost, but it isn't entirely refused. That is, the affordances of the fulfillment center request and encourage compliance and control, but with fracture points that allow labor pushback. Even with these flashes of resis-tance, however, the default remains exploitative and dehumanizing.From a design perspective, the challenge of addressing the Amazon model is thus in altering its defaults, creating instead a workplace that supports and insists on human dignity [75-77]—reconfiguring socio-material conditions to respect, compensate, and value the bodies, lives, and labor of workers. The mechanisms and conditions framework can help with this task, too. Here I suggest three specific proposals that align with calls from labor organizers.These proposals reimagine the data-driven warehouse system in ef-forts to detach the surveillant lens, loosen temporal constraints, and enhance worker autonomy in ways that acknowledge and respect employees as whole human beings. Proposals and their relevant affordances are depicted in Table 3One proposal is to depersonalize tracking within the warehouse,shifting the surveillant lens onto items exclusively, rather than people. At present, each worker is electronically logged upon entering the warehouse for a shift, followed through the warehouse by sensors that attach to employee badges with unique identifiers,and then further tracked when signing into a handheld scanner which stays with them throughout the shift. This scanner is how employees document the products they stock, pick, and pack, but itis also how management tracks and communicates with individual employees while on site. Workers are monitored throughout the warehouse, into the breakroom, the restroom, the corridors, and the parking lot, with accumulated data about how they do each taskand the summative time they spend ‘off task’. Such a system refuses worker privacy, demands surveillance, encourages real-time correc-tion and related punitive measures, and thus requests worker pas-sivity and compliance, while discouraging basic human needs like bathroom breaks and sitting. An alternative configuration might untie tracking from individual employees, dismantling badge read-ers and altering scanner sign-ins to a generic employee ID. Datawould thus pertain to the collective rather than the individual, mon-itoring product flows but not monitoring people. This alternative,generalized mode of tracking would refuse individualized micro-surveillance and attendant micro-management, encouraging logistic efficiency without demanding dehumanizing control.A second proposal is the removal of time rates altogether, or recalculation of rates to inbuild excess time, rather than trimming to its strictest edge. Rates dictate how quickly each item should be stocked, picked, and/or packed, and correspond to an ever-restarting countdown clock flashing at workers from handheld scanners. These clocks demand attention to pace, encourage speed over safety, and are automated in a way that refuses shutdown,slowdown, or adjustment by those judged and governed by tem-poral displays and the urgency these displays communicate. Such Affordances are especially onerous for workers with elder bodies,ill bodies, disabled bodies, injured bodies, tired bodies, and those on temporary contracts whose livelihood can be cut if too many countdown clocks time out. Removing (or revamping) these rates,and the clocks that express them, would instead allow for variation in speed of movement that aligns with the diversity of bodies who do warehouse work, encouraging safety and the occasional friendly workplace conversation in lieu of anxious and tightly monitored temporal parameters.The third proposal is simple: reconfigure scheduling algorithms to set employee timetables two-weeks out and require human in-tervention from management plus a non-punitive approval process 1https://www.amazon labor union.org/from employees if these timetables change. The company could also pool and centralize hours so that employees can pick up, drop,and trade shifts, as suits. Amazon currently uses automated sched-uling tools that predict customer demand and related staffing needs.These tools continue to update in real-time, cutting shifts or addinghours with little notice and no meaningful employee recourse. This system thus discourages a work-life balance for employees, request-ing an always-on, always available relationship to the workplace,while allowing management to practice ‘just in time’ staffing. The Alternative proposal requests a degree of stability and commitment from management in the scheduling protocol by creating friction to its alteration, while encouraging empowered employees who can attend to and adjust for their own scheduling preferences and income needs. This alternative system refuses rigid asymmetries between management and workers and demands respect for workers as whole human beings with lives beyond the warehouse walls.Note that these proposals boil down to not collecting data, collectingless data, or collecting different data and using it more respectfully. I am therefore not suggesting complex models or elegant algorithms, but simple adjustments derived from the labor movements bubbling within Amazon's Warehouse sector, operationalized here through an affordance lens. These Proposals are of course aspirational. Amazon, and Big Capital in general,are programmed to extract. But imagining what could be, in concrete terms,sets a standard for debate. This serves the efforts of collective resistance,articulating a version of reality that corporate interests and the legislators who regulate them, must contend with and contest. In other words, to build the worlds we ought, first we must conceive of them and render those worlds legible.",527-8,automated scheduling tools,

Such a system refuses worker privacy, demands surveillance, encourages real-time correc-tion and related punitive measures, and thus requests worker pas-sivity and compliance, while discouraging basic human needs like bathroom breaks and sitting. An alternative configuration might untie tracking from individual employees, dismantling badge read-ers and altering scanner sign-ins to a generic employee ID. Datawould thus pertain to the collective rather than the individual, mon-itoring product flows but not monitoring people. This alternative,generalized mode of tracking would refuse individualized micro-surveillance and attendant micro-management, encouraging logistic efficiency without demanding dehumanizing control.A second proposal is the removal of time rates altogether, or recalculation of rates to inbuild excess time, rather than trimming to its strictest edge. Rates dictate how quickly each item should be stocked, picked, and/or packed, and correspond to an ever-restarting countdown clock flashing at workers from handheld scanners. These clocks demand attention to pace, encourage speed over safety, and are automated in a way that refuses shutdown,slowdown, or adjustment by those judged and governed by tem-poral displays and the urgency these displays communicate. Such Affordances are especially onerous for workers with elder bodies,ill bodies, disabled bodies, injured bodies, tired bodies, and those on temporary contracts whose livelihood can be cut if too many countdown clocks time out. Removing (or revamping) these rates,and the clocks that express them, would instead allow for variation in speed of movement that aligns with the diversity of bodies who do warehouse work, encouraging safety and the occasional friendly workplace conversation in lieu of anxious and tightly monitored temporal parameters.The third proposal is simple: reconfigure scheduling algorithms to set employee timetables two-weeks out and require human in-tervention from management plus a non-punitive approval process 1https://www.amazon labor union.org/from employees if these timetables change. The company could also pool and centralize hours so that employees can pick up, drop,and trade shifts, as suits. Amazon currently uses automated sched-uling tools that predict customer demand and related staffing needs.These tools continue to update in real-time, cutting shifts or addinghours with little notice and no meaningful employee recourse. This system thus discourages a work-life balance for employees, request-ing an always-on, always available relationship to the workplace,while allowing management to practice ‘just in time’ staffing. The Alternative proposal requests a degree of stability and commitment from management in the scheduling protocol by creating friction to its alteration, while encouraging empowered employees who can attend to and adjust for their own scheduling preferences and income needs. This alternative system refuses rigid asymmetries between management and workers and demands respect for workers as whole human beings with lives beyond the warehouse walls.Note that these proposals boil down to not collecting data, collectingless data, or collecting different data and using it more respectfully. I am therefore not suggesting complex models or elegant algorithms, but simple adjustments derived from the labor movements bubbling within Amazon's Warehouse sector, operationalized here through an affordance lens. These Proposals are of course aspirational. Amazon, and Big Capital in general,are programmed to extract. But imagining what could be, in concrete terms,sets a standard for debate.

These Are sites about which Alessandro Delfanti notes there is an entire genre of journalism, with a growing corpus of activist and academic attention [71-74]. It is from this this documentation—by journal-ists, activists, and academics—that a depiction of warehouse workemerges.Workers in Amazon fulfillment centers do two main things: stock products to be picked and pick products to be shipped. Warehouse Processes are billed as ‘smart’ and ‘efficient,’ driven by always-learning systems that advance and govern based on data from consumer purchases, employees’ bodily movements, time sensors, heat sensors, video monitors, product scanners, curated employee feed-back, targeted employee monitoring, customer feedback, delivery feedback, and managements’ evaluations calibrated to corporate-designated metrics. These data produce algorithms that hire and fire, that set and display countdown timers for increasingly granular tasks, that extend or shorten shifts, dictate how when and where employees move within the warehouse, and that punish employees who are out of synch, too slow, too stagnant, dissatisfied, orunion-inclined. The warehouse also pairs workers with automated systems in an extractive relationship, whereby workers train the synthetic forms designed for human displacement. In a general sense, then, we observe a form of data-based and mechanized governance that deskills and denigrates. How and for whom is clarified with an operationalized affordance lens. For example, these data driven systems demand discretization and au-tomation of warehouse tasks, making knowledge and experience relevant, even a liability, thus allowing management to not only monitor, but also easily discipline and replace workers, while requesting workers move and use their bodies within tightly prescribed choreographies—discouraging (or refusing) embodiment that are ill, disabled, aged, or tired. Management, too, become replaceable and acquiescent, moored to systems that demand attention to metrics, discourage and in some cases refuse skilled and subjective decision making, and request, at multiple levels, service to corporate goals, even when those goals conflict with workers and managers’ labor (and human) interests. Moreover, neither managers nor workers have the cultural and institutional legitimacy, a condition of affordance, to alter, reprogram, or recalibrate system properties, thus refusing agentic input over the very infrastructures that mandate bodily and temporal compliance. Table 2 displays the affordance analysis by which these contentions derive.3.1.2 Reconfiguring Warehouse Standards. To be sure, there are acts of resistance to the mechanized control occurring within Ama-zon’s warehouses. Recall that affordances shape but do not deter-mine, social and behavioral outcomes. Workers ignore their count-down timers, place objects in unfindable slots, choose not to scan items, and engage in union organizing. This comes at a cost, but it isn't entirely refused. That is, the affordances of the fulfillment center request and encourage compliance and control, but with fracture points that allow labor pushback. Even with these flashes of resis-tance, however, the default remains exploitative and dehumanizing.From a design perspective, the challenge of addressing the Amazon model is thus in altering its defaults, creating instead a workplace that supports and insists on human dignity [75-77]—reconfiguring socio-material conditions to respect, compensate, and value the bodies, lives, and labor of workers. The mechanisms and conditions framework can help with this task, too. Here I suggest three specific proposals that align with calls from labor organizers.These proposals reimagine the data-driven warehouse system in ef-forts to detach the surveillant lens, loosen temporal constraints, and enhance worker autonomy in ways that acknowledge and respect employees as whole human beings. Proposals and their relevant affordances are depicted in Table 3One proposal is to depersonalize tracking within the warehouse,shifting the surveillant lens onto items exclusively, rather than people. At present, each worker is electronically logged upon entering the warehouse for a shift, followed through the warehouse by sensors that attach to employee badges with unique identifiers,and then further tracked when signing into a handheld scanner which stays with them throughout the shift.

It is from this this documentation—by journal-ists, activists, and academics—that a depiction of warehouse workemerges.Workers in Amazon fulfillment centers do two main things: stock products to be picked and pick products to be shipped. Warehouse Processes are billed as ‘smart’ and ‘efficient,’ driven by always-learning systems that advance and govern based on data from consumer purchases, employees’ bodily movements, time sensors, heat sensors, video monitors, product scanners, curated employee feed-back, targeted employee monitoring, customer feedback, delivery feedback, and managements’ evaluations calibrated to corporate-designated metrics. These data produce algorithms that hire and fire, that set and display countdown timers for increasingly granular tasks, that extend or shorten shifts, dictate how when and where employees move within the warehouse, and that punish employees who are out of synch, too slow, too stagnant, dissatisfied, orunion-inclined. The warehouse also pairs workers with automated systems in an extractive relationship, whereby workers train the synthetic forms designed for human displacement. In a general sense, then, we observe a form of data-based and mechanized governance that deskills and denigrates. How and for whom is clarified with an operationalized affordance lens. For example, these data driven systems demand discretization and au-tomation of warehouse tasks, making knowledge and experience relevant, even a liability, thus allowing management to not only monitor, but also easily discipline and replace workers, while requesting workers move and use their bodies within tightly prescribed choreographies—discouraging (or refusing) embodiment that are ill, disabled, aged, or tired. Management, too, become replaceable and acquiescent, moored to systems that demand attention to metrics, discourage and in some cases refuse skilled and subjective decision making, and request, at multiple levels, service to corporate goals, even when those goals conflict with workers and managers’ labor (and human) interests. Moreover, neither managers nor workers have the cultural and institutional legitimacy, a condition of affordance, to alter, reprogram, or recalibrate system properties, thus refusing agentic input over the very infrastructures that mandate bodily and temporal compliance. Table 2 displays the affordance analysis by which these contentions derive.3.1.2 Reconfiguring Warehouse Standards. To be sure, there are acts of resistance to the mechanized control occurring within Ama-zon’s warehouses. Recall that affordances shape but do not deter-mine, social and behavioral outcomes. Workers ignore their count-down timers, place objects in unfindable slots, choose not to scan items, and engage in union organizing. This comes at a cost, but it isn't entirely refused. That is, the affordances of the fulfillment center request and encourage compliance and control, but with fracture points that allow labor pushback. Even with these flashes of resis-tance, however, the default remains exploitative and dehumanizing.From a design perspective, the challenge of addressing the Amazon model is thus in altering its defaults, creating instead a workplace that supports and insists on human dignity [75-77]—reconfiguring socio-material conditions to respect, compensate, and value the bodies, lives, and labor of workers. The mechanisms and conditions framework can help with this task, too. Here I suggest three specific proposals that align with calls from labor organizers.These proposals reimagine the data-driven warehouse system in ef-forts to detach the surveillant lens, loosen temporal constraints, and enhance worker autonomy in ways that acknowledge and respect employees as whole human beings. Proposals and their relevant affordances are depicted in Table 3One proposal is to depersonalize tracking within the warehouse,shifting the surveillant lens onto items exclusively, rather than people. At present, each worker is electronically logged upon entering the warehouse for a shift, followed through the warehouse by sensors that attach to employee badges with unique identifiers,and then further tracked when signing into a handheld scanner which stays with them throughout the shift. This scanner is how employees document the products they stock, pick, and pack, but itis also how management tracks and communicates with individual employees while on site. Workers are monitored throughout the warehouse, into the breakroom, the restroom, the corridors, and the parking lot, with accumulated data about how they do each taskand the summative time they spend ‘off task’. Such a system refuses worker privacy, demands surveillance, encourages real-time correc-tion and related punitive measures, and thus requests worker pas-sivity and compliance, while discouraging basic human needs like bathroom breaks and sitting. An alternative configuration might untie tracking from individual employees, dismantling badge read-ers and altering scanner sign-ins to a generic employee ID. Datawould thus pertain to the collective rather than the individual, mon-itoring product flows but not monitoring people. This alternative,generalized mode of tracking would refuse individualized micro-surveillance and attendant micro-management, encouraging logistic efficiency without demanding dehumanizing control.A second proposal is the removal of time rates altogether, or recalculation of rates to inbuild excess time, rather than trimming to its strictest edge. Rates dictate how quickly each item should be stocked, picked, and/or packed, and correspond to an ever-restarting countdown clock flashing at workers from handheld scanners. These clocks demand attention to pace, encourage speed over safety, and are automated in a way that refuses shutdown,slowdown, or adjustment by those judged and governed by tem-poral displays and the urgency these displays communicate. Such Affordances are especially onerous for workers with elder bodies,ill bodies, disabled bodies, injured bodies, tired bodies, and those on temporary contracts whose livelihood can be cut if too many countdown clocks time out. Removing (or revamping) these rates,and the clocks that express them, would instead allow for variation in speed of movement that aligns with the diversity of bodies who do warehouse work, encouraging safety and the occasional friendly workplace conversation in lieu of anxious and tightly monitored temporal parameters.The third proposal is simple: reconfigure scheduling algorithms to set employee timetables two-weeks out and require human in-tervention from management plus a non-punitive approval process 1https://www.amazon labor union.org/from employees if these timetables change. The company could also pool and centralize hours so that employees can pick up, drop,and trade shifts, as suits. Amazon currently uses automated sched-uling tools that predict customer demand and related staffing needs.These tools continue to update in real-time, cutting shifts or addinghours with little notice and no meaningful employee recourse. This system thus discourages a work-life balance for employees, request-ing an always-on, always available relationship to the workplace,while allowing management to practice ‘just in time’ staffing. The Alternative proposal requests a degree of stability and commitment from management in the scheduling protocol by creating friction to its alteration, while encouraging empowered employees who can attend to and adjust for their own scheduling preferences and income needs. This alternative system refuses rigid asymmetries between management and workers and demands respect for workers as whole human beings with lives beyond the warehouse walls.Note that these proposals boil down to not collecting data, collectingless data, or collecting different data and using it more respectfully. I am therefore not suggesting complex models or elegant algorithms, but simple adjustments derived from the labor movements bubbling within Amazon's Warehouse sector, operationalized here through an affordance lens. These Proposals are of course aspirational. Amazon, and Big Capital in general,are programmed to extract. But imagining what could be, in concrete terms,sets a standard for debate.

Here I suggest three specific proposals that align with calls from labor organizers.These proposals reimagine the data-driven warehouse system in ef-forts to detach the surveillant lens, loosen temporal constraints, and enhance worker autonomy in ways that acknowledge and respect employees as whole human beings. Proposals and their relevant affordances are depicted in Table 3One proposal is to depersonalize tracking within the warehouse,shifting the surveillant lens onto items exclusively, rather than people. At present, each worker is electronically logged upon entering the warehouse for a shift, followed through the warehouse by sensors that attach to employee badges with unique identifiers,and then further tracked when signing into a handheld scanner which stays with them throughout the shift. This scanner is how employees document the products they stock, pick, and pack, but itis also how management tracks and communicates with individual employees while on site. Workers are monitored throughout the warehouse, into the breakroom, the restroom, the corridors, and the parking lot, with accumulated data about how they do each taskand the summative time they spend ‘off task’. Such a system refuses worker privacy, demands surveillance, encourages real-time correc-tion and related punitive measures, and thus requests worker pas-sivity and compliance, while discouraging basic human needs like bathroom breaks and sitting. An alternative configuration might untie tracking from individual employees, dismantling badge read-ers and altering scanner sign-ins to a generic employee ID. Datawould thus pertain to the collective rather than the individual, mon-itoring product flows but not monitoring people. This alternative,generalized mode of tracking would refuse individualized micro-surveillance and attendant micro-management, encouraging logistic efficiency without demanding dehumanizing control.A second proposal is the removal of time rates altogether, or recalculation of rates to inbuild excess time, rather than trimming to its strictest edge. Rates dictate how quickly each item should be stocked, picked, and/or packed, and correspond to an ever-restarting countdown clock flashing at workers from handheld scanners. These clocks demand attention to pace, encourage speed over safety, and are automated in a way that refuses shutdown,slowdown, or adjustment by those judged and governed by tem-poral displays and the urgency these displays communicate. Such Affordances are especially onerous for workers with elder bodies,ill bodies, disabled bodies, injured bodies, tired bodies, and those on temporary contracts whose livelihood can be cut if too many countdown clocks time out. Removing (or revamping) these rates,and the clocks that express them, would instead allow for variation in speed of movement that aligns with the diversity of bodies who do warehouse work, encouraging safety and the occasional friendly workplace conversation in lieu of anxious and tightly monitored temporal parameters.The third proposal is simple: reconfigure scheduling algorithms to set employee timetables two-weeks out and require human in-tervention from management plus a non-punitive approval process 1https://www.amazon labor union.org/from employees if these timetables change. The company could also pool and centralize hours so that employees can pick up, drop,and trade shifts, as suits. Amazon currently uses automated sched-uling tools that predict customer demand and related staffing needs.These tools continue to update in real-time, cutting shifts or addinghours with little notice and no meaningful employee recourse. This system thus discourages a work-life balance for employees, request-ing an always-on, always available relationship to the workplace,while allowing management to practice ‘just in time’ staffing. The Alternative proposal requests a degree of stability and commitment from management in the scheduling protocol by creating friction to its alteration, while encouraging empowered employees who can attend to and adjust for their own scheduling preferences and income needs. This alternative system refuses rigid asymmetries between management and workers and demands respect for workers as whole human beings with lives beyond the warehouse walls.Note that these proposals boil down to not collecting data, collectingless data, or collecting different data and using it more respectfully. I am therefore not suggesting complex models or elegant algorithms, but simple adjustments derived from the labor movements bubbling within Amazon's Warehouse sector, operationalized here through an affordance lens. These Proposals are of course aspirational. Amazon, and Big Capital in general,are programmed to extract. But imagining what could be, in concrete terms,sets a standard for debate. This serves the efforts of collective resistance,articulating a version of reality that corporate interests and the legislators who regulate them, must contend with and contest. In other words, to build the worlds we ought, first we must conceive of them and render those worlds legible.",527-8,"neither managers nor workers have the cultural and institutional legitimacy, a condition of affordance, to alter, reprogram, or recalibrate system properties, thus refusing agentic input over the very infrastructures that mandate bodily and temporal compliance."

These Are sites about which Alessandro Delfanti notes there is an entire genre of journalism, with a growing corpus of activist and academic attention [71-74]. It is from this this documentation—by journal-ists, activists, and academics—that a depiction of warehouse workemerges.Workers in Amazon fulfillment centers do two main things: stock products to be picked and pick products to be shipped. Warehouse Processes are billed as ‘smart’ and ‘efficient,’ driven by always-learning systems that advance and govern based on data from consumer purchases, employees’ bodily movements, time sensors, heat sensors, video monitors, product scanners, curated employee feed-back, targeted employee monitoring, customer feedback, delivery feedback, and managements’ evaluations calibrated to corporate-designated metrics. These data produce algorithms that hire and fire, that set and display countdown timers for increasingly granular tasks, that extend or shorten shifts, dictate how when and where employees move within the warehouse, and that punish employees who are out of synch, too slow, too stagnant, dissatisfied, orunion-inclined. The warehouse also pairs workers with automated systems in an extractive relationship, whereby workers train the synthetic forms designed for human displacement. In a general sense, then, we observe a form of data-based and mechanized governance that deskills and denigrates. How and for whom is clarified with an operationalized affordance lens. For example, these data driven systems demand discretization and au-tomation of warehouse tasks, making knowledge and experience relevant, even a liability, thus allowing management to not only monitor, but also easily discipline and replace workers, while requesting workers move and use their bodies within tightly prescribed choreographies—discouraging (or refusing) embodiment that are ill, disabled, aged, or tired. Management, too, become replaceable and acquiescent, moored to systems that demand attention to metrics, discourage and in some cases refuse skilled and subjective decision making, and request, at multiple levels, service to corporate goals, even when those goals conflict with workers and managers’ labor (and human) interests. Moreover, neither managers nor workers have the cultural and institutional legitimacy, a condition of affordance, to alter, reprogram, or recalibrate system properties, thus refusing agentic input over the very infrastructures that mandate bodily and temporal compliance. Table 2 displays the affordance analysis by which these contentions derive.3.1.2 Reconfiguring Warehouse Standards. To be sure, there are acts of resistance to the mechanized control occurring within Ama-zon’s warehouses. Recall that affordances shape but do not deter-mine, social and behavioral outcomes.
