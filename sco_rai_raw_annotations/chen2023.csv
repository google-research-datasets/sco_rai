9,PersonalizedPricing,Perceived_Problem,"In the big data era, personalized pricing has become a popular strategy that sets different prices for the same product according to individual customers‚Äô features. Despite its popularity among compa-nies, this practice is controversial due to the concerns over fairness that can be potentially caused by price discrimination. In this paper, we consider the problem of single-product personalized pricing for different groups under fairness constraints. Specifically, we define group fairness constraints under different distance metrics in the personalized pricing context. We then establish a stochastic formu-lation that maximizes the revenue. Under the discrete price setting,we reformulate this problem as a linear program and obtain the optimal pricing policy efficiently. [...] We use a real-world data set from the e-commerce company JD.com [37] to demonstrate the benefits of our model. 4.3.1 Dataset Introduction. The datasets provided by JD.com granta comprehensive view of the activities related to all SKUs within anonymous consumable category during March 2018. This category could be beauty care (e.g., face moisturizers) or men‚Äôs grooming(e.g., electric shavers). Due to confidentiality, the specific category remains undisclosed. We employ the transaction-level data labeled as i) skus, ii) users, and iii) orders. The data description and basic statistics can be found in Appendix C.3.In this experiment, we use one top-selling product, including2854 customer purchasing records. We select six normal feature (i.e., user level, age, marital status, education, city level, purchase power) and one sensitive feature (i.e., gender). We assign group membership based on the sensitive attribute (i.e., gender), with 1931 in group 1 (i.e., male) and 923 in group 2 (i.e., female). The price set is scaled to be {1.0, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, 2.0, 2.2, 2.4, 2.6, 2.8, 3.0}.4.3.2 Preliminary Analysis. We have checked that the distribution of the normal features, conditioned on the sensitive attributes, is similar. To verify this, we perform a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) teston the distribution of each normal feature, such as age, conditioned on the sensitive attribute (gender). Table 2 presents the p-values obtained from the KS test for each normal feature. In Table 2, the p-values from the KS test are all larger than atypical significance level (e.g., 0.05). This indicates that we cannot reject the null hypothesis that the distributions of the normal fea-tures are the same between the two groups, conditioned on the sensitive attribute (gender). As a result, we can conclude that the distributions of the normal features, conditioned on the sensitive attributes, are similar. In Figure 5a, we can tell that the original pricing distributions between two groups are biased w.r.t. sensitive attribute (i.e., gender). Group 2 (i.e., female) has been charged much higher prices compared with group 1 (i.e., male). Given that the distribution of normal features is similar between the two groups,it is necessary to implement our fairness algorithm to correct this bias and improve social well-being.4.3.3 Analysis on the impact of fairness degree. The result is con-sistent with our simulation study on the impact of fairness. Fig-ure 4 shows how the revenue, customer surplus, and social welfare change respectively as we increase the size of the price set underTVD fairness measures, respectively. From Figure 4, we can tell that as we impose less fairness degree (i.e., larger ùõø), we get lower consumer surplus and social welfare as well as a larger Gini index.From the preliminary analysis in Figure 5a, we find that the female group has a higher valuation on the product and gets charged higher price compared with the male group. Thus, we treat the protected group as the group having a higher valuation for a specific product, which is female in this case. We can tell from the figure 2b that when we decrease the value of ùõø, group 2 (i.e., female) get higher welfare and customer surplus while that group 1 (i.e., male)behaves the opposite. From this interesting observation, we can tell that the protected group (i.e., female) benefits from imposing fairness constraint, indicating that the protected group gets better off when we impose a price parity constraint. In Figure 6, we aim to demonstrate the influence of fairness on social welfare and the Gini index under various pricing constraints.The x-axis represents the fairness degree ùõø, while the y-axis indi-cates social welfare (left plot) and the Gini index (right plot). Asillustrated in the left plot, our proposed model consistently achieves higher social welfare compared to other baseline models, namely those with mean price constraints and single price constraints. In Terms of the Gini index, as shown in the right plot, our model generally exhibits lower values than the mean price constraint model,indicating a more equitable distribution of prices. However, the sin-gle price constraint model exhibits a distinct behavior, with its Gini Index values not consistently lower than those of our model. Over-all, our model outperforms the baseline models in terms of social welfare while maintaining a relatively equitable price distribution,as evidenced by the Gini index.","1520, 1525-7",the problem of single-product personalized pricing ,

We select six normal feature (i.e., user level, age, marital status, education, city level, purchase power) and one sensitive feature (i.e., gender). We assign group membership based on the sensitive attribute (i.e., gender), with 1931 in group 1 (i.e., male) and 923 in group 2 (i.e., female). The price set is scaled to be {1.0, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, 2.0, 2.2, 2.4, 2.6, 2.8, 3.0}.4.3.2 Preliminary Analysis. We have checked that the distribution of the normal features, conditioned on the sensitive attributes, is similar. To verify this, we perform a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) teston the distribution of each normal feature, such as age, conditioned on the sensitive attribute (gender). Table 2 presents the p-values obtained from the KS test for each normal feature. In Table 2, the p-values from the KS test are all larger than atypical significance level (e.g., 0.05). This indicates that we cannot reject the null hypothesis that the distributions of the normal fea-tures are the same between the two groups, conditioned on the sensitive attribute (gender). As a result, we can conclude that the distributions of the normal features, conditioned on the sensitive attributes, are similar. In Figure 5a, we can tell that the original pricing distributions between two groups are biased w.r.t. sensitive attribute (i.e., gender). Group 2 (i.e., female) has been charged much higher prices compared with group 1 (i.e., male). Given that the distribution of normal features is similar between the two groups,it is necessary to implement our fairness algorithm to correct this bias and improve social well-being.4.3.3 Analysis on the impact of fairness degree. The result is con-sistent with our simulation study on the impact of fairness. Fig-ure 4 shows how the revenue, customer surplus, and social welfare change respectively as we increase the size of the price set underTVD fairness measures, respectively. From Figure 4, we can tell that as we impose less fairness degree (i.e., larger ùõø), we get lower consumer surplus and social welfare as well as a larger Gini index.From the preliminary analysis in Figure 5a, we find that the female group has a higher valuation on the product and gets charged higher price compared with the male group. Thus, we treat the protected group as the group having a higher valuation for a specific product, which is female in this case. We can tell from the figure 2b that when we decrease the value of ùõø, group 2 (i.e., female) get higher welfare and customer surplus while that group 1 (i.e., male)behaves the opposite. From this interesting observation, we can tell that the protected group (i.e., female) benefits from imposing fairness constraint, indicating that the protected group gets better off when we impose a price parity constraint. In Figure 6, we aim to demonstrate the influence of fairness on social welfare and the Gini index under various pricing constraints.The x-axis represents the fairness degree ùõø, while the y-axis indi-cates social welfare (left plot) and the Gini index (right plot). Asillustrated in the left plot, our proposed model consistently achieves higher social welfare compared to other baseline models, namely those with mean price constraints and single price constraints. In Terms of the Gini index, as shown in the right plot, our model generally exhibits lower values than the mean price constraint model,indicating a more equitable distribution of prices. However, the sin-gle price constraint model exhibits a distinct behavior, with its Gini Index values not consistently lower than those of our model. Over-all, our model outperforms the baseline models in terms of social welfare while maintaining a relatively equitable price distribution,as evidenced by the Gini index.","1520, 1525-7","biased w.r.t. sensitive attribute (i.e., gender).
