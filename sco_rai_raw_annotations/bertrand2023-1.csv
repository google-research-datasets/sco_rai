9,Roboadvisors,Agent,"As AI systems gain performance, their adoption expands to areas considered critical. In finance, increasingly sophisticated recommender systems known as “roboadvisors” are democratizing online underwriting of life insurance. In France, where the study was conducted, life insurance is a savings vehicle used both to pass on money to a designated beneficiary upon the death of the subscriber of the contract, and to make a long term financial investment in a tax-advantaged environment. In the rest of the paper, we will only address the latter, most common usage of life-insurance. Life insurance subscribers are presented with a financial recommendation with a specific level of risk (a higher level of risk means more chances to win big but also more chances to lose). Choosing a life insurance contract with an appropriate risk level—not too high for the client’s financial situation—is crucial to ensuring clients’ financial stability. However, many clients may not be financially literate. Therefore, French and European legislation require insurance providers to produce “clear, precise and non-misleading” explanations to guide potential customers towards an “informed” decision and address the asymmetry of information between client and advisor [...] We grouped the main identified themes of the explanation requirements according to their connection to the format or content of the explanation. Through the regulator’s view, we were able to gather domain perspectives that end users alone would not necessarily have provided, such as understanding the interests of different stakeholders and potential misalignment, where the vulnerability of certain users can be exploited, or the wide range of best practices seen for recommendations and explanations. Conversely, the end-users’ perspective reminds us of what clients truly care about, regardless of existing regulations. While the main focus of the regulators was on the notion of risk, the main concern of the users was not as clear. For some, it was the performance of the proposed contract, for others the reliability of the robo-advisor, and for others still, the risk. Understanding explanations’ purposes through two perspectives. The regulators reported an increasing trend for automated online robo-advisors, and a lack of “good” automated explanations to support those tools. Current robo-advisors’ explanations were seen as very “generic” and “nebulous” in general. One of the reasons is the use by many brokers of a third-party software to produce explanations and recommendations, over which they have little control. regulators also reported the difficulty for brokers to produce explanations with the increasing complexity of their tools","945, 947","In finance, increasingly sophisticated recommender systems known as “roboadvisors” are democratizing online underwriting of life insurance",

In France, where the study was conducted, life insurance is a savings vehicle used both to pass on money to a designated beneficiary upon the death of the subscriber of the contract, and to make a long term financial investment in a tax-advantaged environment. In the rest of the paper, we will only address the latter, most common usage of life-insurance. Life insurance subscribers are presented with a financial recommendation with a specific level of risk (a higher level of risk means more chances to win big but also more chances to lose). Choosing a life insurance contract with an appropriate risk level—not too high for the client’s financial situation—is crucial to ensuring clients’ financial stability. However, many clients may not be financially literate. Therefore, French and European legislation require insurance providers to produce “clear, precise and non-misleading” explanations to guide potential customers towards an “informed” decision and address the asymmetry of information between client and advisor [...] We grouped the main identified themes of the explanation requirements according to their connection to the format or content of the explanation. Through the regulator’s view, we were able to gather domain perspectives that end users alone would not necessarily have provided, such as understanding the interests of different stakeholders and potential misalignment, where the vulnerability of certain users can be exploited, or the wide range of best practices seen for recommendations and explanations. Conversely, the end-users’ perspective reminds us of what clients truly care about, regardless of existing regulations. While the main focus of the regulators was on the notion of risk, the main concern of the users was not as clear. For some, it was the performance of the proposed contract, for others the reliability of the robo-advisor, and for others still, the risk. Understanding explanations’ purposes through two perspectives. The regulators reported an increasing trend for automated online robo-advisors, and a lack of “good” automated explanations to support those tools. Current robo-advisors’ explanations were seen as very “generic” and “nebulous” in general. One of the reasons is the use by many brokers of a third-party software to produce explanations and recommendations, over which they have little control. regulators also reported the difficulty for brokers to produce explanations with the increasing complexity of their tools","945, 947",the use by many brokers of a third-party software to produce explanations and recommendations
