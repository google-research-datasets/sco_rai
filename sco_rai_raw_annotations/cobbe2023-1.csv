9,MultipleActors,Agent,"In algorithmic supply chains, different aspects of production, deployment, and use of AI technologies are split between multiple actors tied together by data flows. As a result, the activities of the various actors in supply chains each depend on the actions of by others. This may involve various interacting AI and non-AItechnologies, such as cloud services, servers, data centers, datasources, and content delivery networks, controlled by different ac-tors. The working together of the various actors who control these technologies—each doing something that enables, supports, or facil-itates the actions of others—produces a particular outcome (see Fig.2). Each actor in a supply chain may not be aware of the others, norhave consciously decided to work together towards that outcome –indeed, they may have limited understanding of actors even one or two steps removed (see §4.2). However, each depends on something done by others, and their role in a supply chain is contingent on the activities of actors both up– and downstream of them.Actors in algorithmic supply chains are thus interdependent, each doing something to fulfill the needs of others (such as processing a particular data input and returning an output, or providing infras-tructure to support application deployment). The interdependence of the various actors responsible for developing, deploying, and operating algorithmic systems in supply chains means they are not individual, independent actors as such. Instead, these actors,their relations, and their role in the workings and effects of AItechnologies can only be understood in the context of that supply chain. Studying an actor and their systems in isolation from supply chain contexts is akin to studying an algorithmic model in isolation from its broader organizational context (the limitations of which are increasingly recognised (see §2)). The dynamics of interdependence in algorithmic supply chains—how they are structured, the relative importance of actors, and how problems spread—are therefore key considerations for algorithmic accountability, as we now explore.3.1.1 Supply chain interdependencies are structured by technologi-cal, legal, and political economic factors. Interdependence between actors gives algorithmic supply chains their structure and func-tionality. Certain actors—typically (AI and non-AI) cloud service providers—have leveraged AI technologies they own, production processes they control, and cheaply-accessed networking technolo-gies to pursue particular interdependencies with others and strate-gically position themselves in markets and supply chains of many kinds. Technologies afford certain capabilities to those who use or control them [30, 41, 78]. They can therefore also afford the ability to do things that fulfill the needs of others. Because, as we discuss in§3.1, people doing things for each other produces interdependence between them [35], different technologies can afford different kinds of interdependencies. Networking and data processing technolo-gies, for example, allow the stages of production and deployment ofAI technologies to be distributed geographically. They can therefore be done by different people, each of whom does something for the others, producing interdependence between them.However, technologies and their affordances cannot determine interdependencies or the structure of supply chains. Affordancesare not objective properties of technologies, but depend on context and perspective [30, 32, 41, 78, 108]. How providers can strategically position themselves is thus shaped both by their technologies’ af-fordances and by social, legal, and political economic factors which also influence how actors relate to each other, what they do for eachother, and the interdependencies that arise. Accordingly, to posi-tion themselves in supply chains and markets, providers have also leveraged political economic factors such as economies of scale and favorable legal frameworks such as intellectual property, interme-diary liability, and data protection [24, 25, 27]. Political economic and legal factors—not just technological—are thus important in producing and structuring algorithmic supply chains.3.1.2 Some actors are core players in supply chains. Supply chain actors are generally not equal in their interdependence with each other, and some may do things that others particularly depend on. Their services, for example, may be relied upon by multiple others, as is often the provider’s aim in offering general purpose services. Providers may depend on each customer only a little, while customers may depend on the provider for business-critical application functionality. Supply chain interdependencies are thus often asymmetric, with certain actors—typically including at least those responsible for production of AI technologies—performing core functions for others, while others are more peripheral. Various Contextual signs might indicate that an actor is core in a particular chain. For example, they may be the application developer who calls the supply chain into existence. They may perform some function(such as providing an AI service) which is crucial to application functionality. They may provide a key step between actors (such as offering access to another provider’s technology through theirAPI) upon which subsequent steps of the chain depend. Or they may appear at multiple different points in the chain providing cloud-based technical architecture on which functions performed by other actors rely. Some actors may also be more interchangeable and replaceable than others – the barrier to entry for applying specific off-the-shelf API is typically substantially lower than to generate the underlying technology to begin with.These asymmetries of interdependence produce asymmetries of power [35]: where one actor depends more on things done by another than that other depends on them, the balance of power between them favors the second actor [35]. An application developer, for example, who uses a major provider’s AI service, will depend more on that provider than the provider—who has many customers—will depend on that one developer. Power balances in algorithmic supply chains thus arise relationally yet asymmetrically and change over time as the relations and interdependencies between actors evolve [35]. These power balances are not determined by actors’ relations to the technologies involved, but through their relation to and interdependence with each other. As we note (§3.1.1),this is subject to many potential influences, of which factors like control of production processes and APIs are just some. But, by leveraging their technologies alongside legal, social, and political economic factors, providers can hold significantly asymmetrical positions as core actors in many supply chains, with power balance between them and others heavily in their favour.3.1.3 Interdependence helps problems propagate. Supply chain in-terdependencies mean problems with one actor’s technologies can propagate through other actors’ systems. Where an AI service is biased in some way (such as facial recognition performing poorly on particular demographics [15]), that bias will be inherited by applications relying on that service [64]. Such a cascade’s effect may be complex and unpredictable given the dynamic and largely undocumented set of actors and interdependencies found in many chains. Statistical guarantees may not hold when systems are com-posed together, and it is not straightforward to evaluate a whole system when each individual component may have been evaluated under different threat models (or other criteria) [58, 64]. Unless Identified by the provider, actors ‘downstream’ from them may be unaware of a problem until they notice some unexpected behaviour.Even then, because they have delegated key aspects of production(and possibly deployment) of the technologies their application relies on to other actors (such as AI service providers), customers may struggle to understand where in a supply chain the problem has arisen, why, and what they can do to mitigate it.",1189-90,multiple actors tied together by data flows.,

Such a cascade’s effect may be complex and unpredictable given the dynamic and largely undocumented set of actors and interdependencies found in many chains. Statistical guarantees may not hold when systems are com-posed together, and it is not straightforward to evaluate a whole system when each individual component may have been evaluated under different threat models (or other criteria) [58, 64].

14,AlgorithmicSupplyChains,Artifact,"In algorithmic supply chains, different aspects of production, deployment, and use of AI technologies are split between multiple actors tied together by data flows. As a result, the activities of the various actors in supply chains each depend on the actions of by others. This may involve various interacting AI and non-AItechnologies, such as cloud services, servers, data centers, datasources, and content delivery networks, controlled by different ac-tors. The working together of the various actors who control these technologies—each doing something that enables, supports, or facil-itates the actions of others—produces a particular outcome (see Fig.2). Each actor in a supply chain may not be aware of the others, norhave consciously decided to work together towards that outcome –indeed, they may have limited understanding of actors even one or two steps removed (see §4.2). However, each depends on something done by others, and their role in a supply chain is contingent on the activities of actors both up– and downstream of them.Actors in algorithmic supply chains are thus interdependent, each doing something to fulfill the needs of others (such as processing a particular data input and returning an output, or providing infras-tructure to support application deployment). The interdependence of the various actors responsible for developing, deploying, and operating algorithmic systems in supply chains means they are not individual, independent actors as such. Instead, these actors,their relations, and their role in the workings and effects of AItechnologies can only be understood in the context of that supply chain. Studying an actor and their systems in isolation from supply chain contexts is akin to studying an algorithmic model in isolation from its broader organizational context (the limitations of which are increasingly recognised (see §2)). The dynamics of interdependence in algorithmic supply chains—how they are structured, the relative importance of actors, and how problems spread—are therefore key considerations for algorithmic accountability, as we now explore.3.1.1 Supply chain interdependencies are structured by technologi-cal, legal, and political economic factors. Interdependence between actors gives algorithmic supply chains their structure and func-tionality. Certain actors—typically (AI and non-AI) cloud service providers—have leveraged AI technologies they own, production processes they control, and cheaply-accessed networking technolo-gies to pursue particular interdependencies with others and strate-gically position themselves in markets and supply chains of many kinds. Technologies afford certain capabilities to those who use or control them [30, 41, 78]. They can therefore also afford the ability to do things that fulfill the needs of others. Because, as we discuss in§3.1, people doing things for each other produces interdependence between them [35], different technologies can afford different kinds of interdependencies. Networking and data processing technolo-gies, for example, allow the stages of production and deployment ofAI technologies to be distributed geographically. They can therefore be done by different people, each of whom does something for the others, producing interdependence between them.However, technologies and their affordances cannot determine interdependencies or the structure of supply chains. Affordancesare not objective properties of technologies, but depend on context and perspective [30, 32, 41, 78, 108]. How providers can strategically position themselves is thus shaped both by their technologies’ af-fordances and by social, legal, and political economic factors which also influence how actors relate to each other, what they do for eachother, and the interdependencies that arise. Accordingly, to posi-tion themselves in supply chains and markets, providers have also leveraged political economic factors such as economies of scale and favorable legal frameworks such as intellectual property, interme-diary liability, and data protection [24, 25, 27]. Political economic and legal factors—not just technological—are thus important in producing and structuring algorithmic supply chains.3.1.2 Some actors are core players in supply chains. Supply chain actors are generally not equal in their interdependence with each other, and some may do things that others particularly depend on. Their services, for example, may be relied upon by multiple others, as is often the provider’s aim in offering general purpose services. Providers may depend on each customer only a little, while customers may depend on the provider for business-critical application functionality. Supply chain interdependencies are thus often asymmetric, with certain actors—typically including at least those responsible for production of AI technologies—performing core functions for others, while others are more peripheral. Various Contextual signs might indicate that an actor is core in a particular chain. For example, they may be the application developer who calls the supply chain into existence. They may perform some function(such as providing an AI service) which is crucial to application functionality. They may provide a key step between actors (such as offering access to another provider’s technology through theirAPI) upon which subsequent steps of the chain depend. Or they may appear at multiple different points in the chain providing cloud-based technical architecture on which functions performed by other actors rely. Some actors may also be more interchangeable and replaceable than others – the barrier to entry for applying specific off-the-shelf API is typically substantially lower than to generate the underlying technology to begin with.These asymmetries of interdependence produce asymmetries of power [35]: where one actor depends more on things done by another than that other depends on them, the balance of power between them favors the second actor [35]. An application developer, for example, who uses a major provider’s AI service, will depend more on that provider than the provider—who has many customers—will depend on that one developer. Power balances in algorithmic supply chains thus arise relationally yet asymmetrically and change over time as the relations and interdependencies between actors evolve [35]. These power balances are not determined by actors’ relations to the technologies involved, but through their relation to and interdependence with each other. As we note (§3.1.1),this is subject to many potential influences, of which factors like control of production processes and APIs are just some. But, by leveraging their technologies alongside legal, social, and political economic factors, providers can hold significantly asymmetrical positions as core actors in many supply chains, with power balance between them and others heavily in their favour.3.1.3 Interdependence helps problems propagate. Supply chain in-terdependencies mean problems with one actor’s technologies can propagate through other actors’ systems.

Such a cascade’s effect may be complex and unpredictable given the dynamic and largely undocumented set of actors and interdependencies found in many chains. Statistical guarantees may not hold when systems are com-posed together, and it is not straightforward to evaluate a whole system when each individual component may have been evaluated under different threat models (or other criteria) [58, 64].

19,PowerBalances,Causal_Theory,"In algorithmic supply chains, different aspects of production, deployment, and use of AI technologies are split between multiple actors tied together by data flows. As a result, the activities of the various actors in supply chains each depend on the actions of by others. This may involve various interacting AI and non-AItechnologies, such as cloud services, servers, data centers, datasources, and content delivery networks, controlled by different ac-tors. The working together of the various actors who control these technologies—each doing something that enables, supports, or facil-itates the actions of others—produces a particular outcome (see Fig.2). Each actor in a supply chain may not be aware of the others, norhave consciously decided to work together towards that outcome –indeed, they may have limited understanding of actors even one or two steps removed (see §4.2). However, each depends on something done by others, and their role in a supply chain is contingent on the activities of actors both up– and downstream of them.Actors in algorithmic supply chains are thus interdependent, each doing something to fulfill the needs of others (such as processing a particular data input and returning an output, or providing infras-tructure to support application deployment). The interdependence of the various actors responsible for developing, deploying, and operating algorithmic systems in supply chains means they are not individual, independent actors as such. Instead, these actors,their relations, and their role in the workings and effects of AItechnologies can only be understood in the context of that supply chain. Studying an actor and their systems in isolation from supply chain contexts is akin to studying an algorithmic model in isolation from its broader organizational context (the limitations of which are increasingly recognised (see §2)). The dynamics of interdependence in algorithmic supply chains—how they are structured, the relative importance of actors, and how problems spread—are therefore key considerations for algorithmic accountability, as we now explore.3.1.1 Supply chain interdependencies are structured by technologi-cal, legal, and political economic factors. Interdependence between actors gives algorithmic supply chains their structure and func-tionality. Certain actors—typically (AI and non-AI) cloud service providers—have leveraged AI technologies they own, production processes they control, and cheaply-accessed networking technolo-gies to pursue particular interdependencies with others and strate-gically position themselves in markets and supply chains of many kinds. Technologies afford certain capabilities to those who use or control them [30, 41, 78]. They can therefore also afford the ability to do things that fulfill the needs of others. Because, as we discuss in§3.1, people doing things for each other produces interdependence between them [35], different technologies can afford different kinds of interdependencies. Networking and data processing technolo-gies, for example, allow the stages of production and deployment ofAI technologies to be distributed geographically. They can therefore be done by different people, each of whom does something for the others, producing interdependence between them.However, technologies and their affordances cannot determine interdependencies or the structure of supply chains. Affordancesare not objective properties of technologies, but depend on context and perspective [30, 32, 41, 78, 108]. How providers can strategically position themselves is thus shaped both by their technologies’ af-fordances and by social, legal, and political economic factors which also influence how actors relate to each other, what they do for eachother, and the interdependencies that arise. Accordingly, to posi-tion themselves in supply chains and markets, providers have also leveraged political economic factors such as economies of scale and favorable legal frameworks such as intellectual property, interme-diary liability, and data protection [24, 25, 27]. Political economic and legal factors—not just technological—are thus important in producing and structuring algorithmic supply chains.3.1.2 Some actors are core players in supply chains. Supply chain actors are generally not equal in their interdependence with each other, and some may do things that others particularly depend on. Their services, for example, may be relied upon by multiple others, as is often the provider’s aim in offering general purpose services. Providers may depend on each customer only a little, while customers may depend on the provider for business-critical application functionality. Supply chain interdependencies are thus often asymmetric, with certain actors—typically including at least those responsible for production of AI technologies—performing core functions for others, while others are more peripheral. Various Contextual signs might indicate that an actor is core in a particular chain. For example, they may be the application developer who calls the supply chain into existence. They may perform some function(such as providing an AI service) which is crucial to application functionality. They may provide a key step between actors (such as offering access to another provider’s technology through theirAPI) upon which subsequent steps of the chain depend. Or they may appear at multiple different points in the chain providing cloud-based technical architecture on which functions performed by other actors rely. Some actors may also be more interchangeable and replaceable than others – the barrier to entry for applying specific off-the-shelf API is typically substantially lower than to generate the underlying technology to begin with.These asymmetries of interdependence produce asymmetries of power [35]: where one actor depends more on things done by another than that other depends on them, the balance of power between them favors the second actor [35]. An application developer, for example, who uses a major provider’s AI service, will depend more on that provider than the provider—who has many customers—will depend on that one developer. Power balances in algorithmic supply chains thus arise relationally yet asymmetrically and change over time as the relations and interdependencies between actors evolve [35]. These power balances are not determined by actors’ relations to the technologies involved, but through their relation to and interdependence with each other. As we note (§3.1.1),this is subject to many potential influences, of which factors like control of production processes and APIs are just some. But, by leveraging their technologies alongside legal, social, and political economic factors, providers can hold significantly asymmetrical positions as core actors in many supply chains, with power balance between them and others heavily in their favour.3.1.3 Interdependence helps problems propagate.

24,ActorsInSupplyChains,Agent,"In algorithmic supply chains, different aspects of production, deployment, and use of AI technologies are split between multiple actors tied together by data flows. As a result, the activities of the various actors in supply chains each depend on the actions of by others. This may involve various interacting AI and non-AItechnologies, such as cloud services, servers, data centers, datasources, and content delivery networks, controlled by different ac-tors. The working together of the various actors who control these technologies—each doing something that enables, supports, or facil-itates the actions of others—produces a particular outcome (see Fig.2). Each actor in a supply chain may not be aware of the others, norhave consciously decided to work together towards that outcome –indeed, they may have limited understanding of actors even one or two steps removed (see §4.2). However, each depends on something done by others, and their role in a supply chain is contingent on the activities of actors both up– and downstream of them.Actors in algorithmic supply chains are thus interdependent, each doing something to fulfill the needs of others (such as processing a particular data input and returning an output, or providing infras-tructure to support application deployment). The interdependence of the various actors responsible for developing, deploying, and operating algorithmic systems in supply chains means they are not individual, independent actors as such. Instead, these actors,their relations, and their role in the workings and effects of AItechnologies can only be understood in the context of that supply chain. Studying an actor and their systems in isolation from supply chain contexts is akin to studying an algorithmic model in isolation from its broader organizational context (the limitations of which are increasingly recognised (see §2)). The dynamics of interdependence in algorithmic supply chains—how they are structured, the relative importance of actors, and how problems spread—are therefore key considerations for algorithmic accountability, as we now explore.3.1.1 Supply chain interdependencies are structured by technologi-cal, legal, and political economic factors. Interdependence between actors gives algorithmic supply chains their structure and func-tionality. Certain actors—typically (AI and non-AI) cloud service providers—have leveraged AI technologies they own, production processes they control, and cheaply-accessed networking technolo-gies to pursue particular interdependencies with others and strate-gically position themselves in markets and supply chains of many kinds. Technologies afford certain capabilities to those who use or control them [30, 41, 78]. They can therefore also afford the ability to do things that fulfill the needs of others. Because, as we discuss in§3.1, people doing things for each other produces interdependence between them [35], different technologies can afford different kinds of interdependencies. Networking and data processing technolo-gies, for example, allow the stages of production and deployment ofAI technologies to be distributed geographically. They can therefore be done by different people, each of whom does something for the others, producing interdependence between them.However, technologies and their affordances cannot determine interdependencies or the structure of supply chains. Affordancesare not objective properties of technologies, but depend on context and perspective [30, 32, 41, 78, 108]. How providers can strategically position themselves is thus shaped both by their technologies’ af-fordances and by social, legal, and political economic factors which also influence how actors relate to each other, what they do for eachother, and the interdependencies that arise. Accordingly, to posi-tion themselves in supply chains and markets, providers have also leveraged political economic factors such as economies of scale and favorable legal frameworks such as intellectual property, interme-diary liability, and data protection [24, 25, 27]. Political economic and legal factors—not just technological—are thus important in producing and structuring algorithmic supply chains.3.1.2 Some actors are core players in supply chains. Supply chain actors are generally not equal in their interdependence with each other, and some may do things that others particularly depend on. Their services, for example, may be relied upon by multiple others, as is often the provider’s aim in offering general purpose services. Providers may depend on each customer only a little, while customers may depend on the provider for business-critical application functionality. Supply chain interdependencies are thus often asymmetric, with certain actors—typically including at least those responsible for production of AI technologies—performing core functions for others, while others are more peripheral. Various Contextual signs might indicate that an actor is core in a particular chain. For example, they may be the application developer who calls the supply chain into existence. They may perform some function(such as providing an AI service) which is crucial to application functionality. They may provide a key step between actors (such as offering access to another provider’s technology through theirAPI) upon which subsequent steps of the chain depend. Or they may appear at multiple different points in the chain providing cloud-based technical architecture on which functions performed by other actors rely. Some actors may also be more interchangeable and replaceable than others – the barrier to entry for applying specific off-the-shelf API is typically substantially lower than to generate the underlying technology to begin with.These asymmetries of interdependence produce asymmetries of power [35]: where one actor depends more on things done by another than that other depends on them, the balance of power between them favors the second actor [35]. An application developer, for example, who uses a major provider’s AI service, will depend more on that provider than the provider—who has many customers—will depend on that one developer. Power balances in algorithmic supply chains thus arise relationally yet asymmetrically and change over time as the relations and interdependencies between actors evolve [35]. These power balances are not determined by actors’ relations to the technologies involved, but through their relation to and interdependence with each other. As we note (§3.1.1),this is subject to many potential influences, of which factors like control of production processes and APIs are just some. But, by leveraging their technologies alongside legal, social, and political economic factors, providers can hold significantly asymmetrical positions as core actors in many supply chains, with power balance between them and others heavily in their favour.3.1.3 Interdependence helps problems propagate. Supply chain in-terdependencies mean problems with one actor’s technologies can propagate through other actors’ systems.

These power balances are not determined by actors’ relations to the technologies involved, but through their relation to and interdependence with each other. As we note (§3.1.1),this is subject to many potential influences, of which factors like control of production processes and APIs are just some. But, by leveraging their technologies alongside legal, social, and political economic factors, providers can hold significantly asymmetrical positions as core actors in many supply chains, with power balance between them and others heavily in their favour.3.1.3 Interdependence helps problems propagate. Supply chain in-terdependencies mean problems with one actor’s technologies can propagate through other actors’ systems. Where an AI service is biased in some way (such as facial recognition performing poorly on particular demographics [15]), that bias will be inherited by applications relying on that service [64]. Such a cascade’s effect may be complex and unpredictable given the dynamic and largely undocumented set of actors and interdependencies found in many chains. Statistical guarantees may not hold when systems are com-posed together, and it is not straightforward to evaluate a whole system when each individual component may have been evaluated under different threat models (or other criteria) [58, 64]. Unless Identified by the provider, actors ‘downstream’ from them may be unaware of a problem until they notice some unexpected behaviour.Even then, because they have delegated key aspects of production(and possibly deployment) of the technologies their application relies on to other actors (such as AI service providers), customers may struggle to understand where in a supply chain the problem has arisen, why, and what they can do to mitigate it.",1189-90,"Networking and data processing technologies, for example, allow the stages of production and deployment of AI technologies to be distributed geographically."
33,AffordancesAndFactors,constrainsAgent,Providers,"In algorithmic supply chains, different aspects of production, deployment, and use of AI technologies are split between multiple actors tied together by data flows. As a result, the activities of the various actors in supply chains each depend on the actions of by others. This may involve various interacting AI and non-AItechnologies, such as cloud services, servers, data centers, datasources, and content delivery networks, controlled by different ac-tors. The working together of the various actors who control these technologies—each doing something that enables, supports, or facil-itates the actions of others—produces a particular outcome (see Fig.2). Each actor in a supply chain may not be aware of the others, norhave consciously decided to work together towards that outcome –indeed, they may have limited understanding of actors even one or two steps removed (see §4.2). However, each depends on something done by others, and their role in a supply chain is contingent on the activities of actors both up– and downstream of them.Actors in algorithmic supply chains are thus interdependent, each doing something to fulfill the needs of others (such as processing a particular data input and returning an output, or providing infras-tructure to support application deployment). The interdependence of the various actors responsible for developing, deploying, and operating algorithmic systems in supply chains means they are not individual, independent actors as such. Instead, these actors,their relations, and their role in the workings and effects of AItechnologies can only be understood in the context of that supply chain. Studying an actor and their systems in isolation from supply chain contexts is akin to studying an algorithmic model in isolation from its broader organizational context (the limitations of which are increasingly recognised (see §2)). The dynamics of interdependence in algorithmic supply chains—how they are structured, the relative importance of actors, and how problems spread—are therefore key considerations for algorithmic accountability, as we now explore.3.1.1 Supply chain interdependencies are structured by technologi-cal, legal, and political economic factors. Interdependence between actors gives algorithmic supply chains their structure and func-tionality. Certain actors—typically (AI and non-AI) cloud service providers—have leveraged AI technologies they own, production processes they control, and cheaply-accessed networking technolo-gies to pursue particular interdependencies with others and strate-gically position themselves in markets and supply chains of many kinds. Technologies afford certain capabilities to those who use or control them [30, 41, 78]. They can therefore also afford the ability to do things that fulfill the needs of others. Because, as we discuss in§3.1, people doing things for each other produces interdependence between them [35], different technologies can afford different kinds of interdependencies. Networking and data processing technolo-gies, for example, allow the stages of production and deployment ofAI technologies to be distributed geographically. They can therefore be done by different people, each of whom does something for the others, producing interdependence between them.However, technologies and their affordances cannot determine interdependencies or the structure of supply chains. Affordancesare not objective properties of technologies, but depend on context and perspective [30, 32, 41, 78, 108]. How providers can strategically position themselves is thus shaped both by their technologies’ af-fordances and by social, legal, and political economic factors which also influence how actors relate to each other, what they do for eachother, and the interdependencies that arise. Accordingly, to posi-tion themselves in supply chains and markets, providers have also leveraged political economic factors such as economies of scale and favorable legal frameworks such as intellectual property, interme-diary liability, and data protection [24, 25, 27]. Political economic and legal factors—not just technological—are thus important in producing and structuring algorithmic supply chains.3.1.2 Some actors are core players in supply chains. Supply chain actors are generally not equal in their interdependence with each other, and some may do things that others particularly depend on. Their services, for example, may be relied upon by multiple others, as is often the provider’s aim in offering general purpose services. Providers may depend on each customer only a little, while customers may depend on the provider for business-critical application functionality. Supply chain interdependencies are thus often asymmetric, with certain actors—typically including at least those responsible for production of AI technologies—performing core functions for others, while others are more peripheral. Various Contextual signs might indicate that an actor is core in a particular chain. For example, they may be the application developer who calls the supply chain into existence. They may perform some function(such as providing an AI service) which is crucial to application functionality. They may provide a key step between actors (such as offering access to another provider’s technology through theirAPI) upon which subsequent steps of the chain depend. Or they may appear at multiple different points in the chain providing cloud-based technical architecture on which functions performed by other actors rely. Some actors may also be more interchangeable and replaceable than others – the barrier to entry for applying specific off-the-shelf API is typically substantially lower than to generate the underlying technology to begin with.These asymmetries of interdependence produce asymmetries of power [35]: where one actor depends more on things done by another than that other depends on them, the balance of power between them favors the second actor [35]. An application developer, for example, who uses a major provider’s AI service, will depend more on that provider than the provider—who has many customers—will depend on that one developer. Power balances in algorithmic supply chains thus arise relationally yet asymmetrically and change over time as the relations and interdependencies between actors evolve [35].

Some actors may also be more interchangeable and replaceable than others – the barrier to entry for applying specific off-the-shelf API is typically substantially lower than to generate the underlying technology to begin with.These asymmetries of interdependence produce asymmetries of power [35]: where one actor depends more on things done by another than that other depends on them, the balance of power between them favors the second actor [35]. An application developer, for example, who uses a major provider’s AI service, will depend more on that provider than the provider—who has many customers—will depend on that one developer. Power balances in algorithmic supply chains thus arise relationally yet asymmetrically and change over time as the relations and interdependencies between actors evolve [35]. These power balances are not determined by actors’ relations to the technologies involved, but through their relation to and interdependence with each other. As we note (§3.1.1),this is subject to many potential influences, of which factors like control of production processes and APIs are just some. But, by leveraging their technologies alongside legal, social, and political economic factors, providers can hold significantly asymmetrical positions as core actors in many supply chains, with power balance between them and others heavily in their favour.3.1.3 Interdependence helps problems propagate. Supply chain in-terdependencies mean problems with one actor’s technologies can propagate through other actors’ systems. Where an AI service is biased in some way (such as facial recognition performing poorly on particular demographics [15]), that bias will be inherited by applications relying on that service [64]. Such a cascade’s effect may be complex and unpredictable given the dynamic and largely undocumented set of actors and interdependencies found in many chains. Statistical guarantees may not hold when systems are com-posed together, and it is not straightforward to evaluate a whole system when each individual component may have been evaluated under different threat models (or other criteria) [58, 64]. Unless Identified by the provider, actors ‘downstream’ from them may be unaware of a problem until they notice some unexpected behaviour.Even then, because they have delegated key aspects of production(and possibly deployment) of the technologies their application relies on to other actors (such as AI service providers), customers may struggle to understand where in a supply chain the problem has arisen, why, and what they can do to mitigate it.",1189-90,They may perform some function(such as providing an AI service) which is crucial to application functionality. They may provide a key step between actors (such as offering access to another provider’s technology through their API) upon which subsequent steps of the chain depend.
38,AlgorithmicSupplyChains,influencesPrecept,ProgagationOfBias,"In algorithmic supply chains, different aspects of production, deployment, and use of AI technologies are split between multiple actors tied together by data flows. As a result, the activities of the various actors in supply chains each depend on the actions of by others. This may involve various interacting AI and non-AItechnologies, such as cloud services, servers, data centers, datasources, and content delivery networks, controlled by different ac-tors. The working together of the various actors who control these technologies—each doing something that enables, supports, or facil-itates the actions of others—produces a particular outcome (see Fig.2). Each actor in a supply chain may not be aware of the others, norhave consciously decided to work together towards that outcome –indeed, they may have limited understanding of actors even one or two steps removed (see §4.2). However, each depends on something done by others, and their role in a supply chain is contingent on the activities of actors both up– and downstream of them.Actors in algorithmic supply chains are thus interdependent, each doing something to fulfill the needs of others (such as processing a particular data input and returning an output, or providing infras-tructure to support application deployment). The interdependence of the various actors responsible for developing, deploying, and operating algorithmic systems in supply chains means they are not individual, independent actors as such. Instead, these actors,their relations, and their role in the workings and effects of AItechnologies can only be understood in the context of that supply chain. Studying an actor and their systems in isolation from supply chain contexts is akin to studying an algorithmic model in isolation from its broader organizational context (the limitations of which are increasingly recognised (see §2)). The dynamics of interdependence in algorithmic supply chains—how they are structured, the relative importance of actors, and how problems spread—are therefore key considerations for algorithmic accountability, as we now explore.3.1.1 Supply chain interdependencies are structured by technologi-cal, legal, and political economic factors. Interdependence between actors gives algorithmic supply chains their structure and func-tionality. Certain actors—typically (AI and non-AI) cloud service providers—have leveraged AI technologies they own, production processes they control, and cheaply-accessed networking technolo-gies to pursue particular interdependencies with others and strate-gically position themselves in markets and supply chains of many kinds. Technologies afford certain capabilities to those who use or control them [30, 41, 78]. They can therefore also afford the ability to do things that fulfill the needs of others. Because, as we discuss in§3.1, people doing things for each other produces interdependence between them [35], different technologies can afford different kinds of interdependencies. Networking and data processing technolo-gies, for example, allow the stages of production and deployment ofAI technologies to be distributed geographically. They can therefore be done by different people, each of whom does something for the others, producing interdependence between them.However, technologies and their affordances cannot determine interdependencies or the structure of supply chains. Affordancesare not objective properties of technologies, but depend on context and perspective [30, 32, 41, 78, 108]. How providers can strategically position themselves is thus shaped both by their technologies’ af-fordances and by social, legal, and political economic factors which also influence how actors relate to each other, what they do for eachother, and the interdependencies that arise. Accordingly, to posi-tion themselves in supply chains and markets, providers have also leveraged political economic factors such as economies of scale and favorable legal frameworks such as intellectual property, interme-diary liability, and data protection [24, 25, 27]. Political economic and legal factors—not just technological—are thus important in producing and structuring algorithmic supply chains.3.1.2 Some actors are core players in supply chains. Supply chain actors are generally not equal in their interdependence with each other, and some may do things that others particularly depend on. Their services, for example, may be relied upon by multiple others, as is often the provider’s aim in offering general purpose services. Providers may depend on each customer only a little, while customers may depend on the provider for business-critical application functionality. Supply chain interdependencies are thus often asymmetric, with certain actors—typically including at least those responsible for production of AI technologies—performing core functions for others, while others are more peripheral. Various Contextual signs might indicate that an actor is core in a particular chain. For example, they may be the application developer who calls the supply chain into existence. They may perform some function(such as providing an AI service) which is crucial to application functionality. They may provide a key step between actors (such as offering access to another provider’s technology through theirAPI) upon which subsequent steps of the chain depend. Or they may appear at multiple different points in the chain providing cloud-based technical architecture on which functions performed by other actors rely.
