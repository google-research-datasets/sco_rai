9,Families,Agent,"To identify the cutoffs to gain admissions to various middle- and high-schools, I used a crowdsourcing survey where families were asked to enter their lottery number (only the first two characters to preserve anonymity), the school to which they matched, and the schools they ranked higher than their match. They were also asked to enter information on which priority group their students qualified for. The survey was done via Google Forms, answers were kept completely anonymous, and no identifying (or re-identifying)information was requested. The survey was approved by Rutgers Institutional Review Board. Participants were recruited through messages on social media parent groups.The survey result data was used to identify the “worst” lottery number that received an offer to the school, and the “best” that did not. The corresponding percentile in the theoretical distribution was used to get a lower and upper bound of the odds of matching to a given school. Note that these odds represent chances of matching to a given school or to a school ranked higher on the student list, as the matching algorithm will only consider a student for a school if they haven’t matched to a school they ranked higher.The full results of the surveys were published online [22], allow-ing families applying in later years to have a better idea of the odds of admissions at their preferred schools and to adjust their ranked list accordingly. For the 2021 admission season, the survey received 136 (107 with lottery numbers) answers from high-school applicants and 125 (70 with lottery numbers) answers from middle-school ap-plicants. Note that in 2021 the DOE did not provide families with their lottery number, accessing it required parents to file a FOILrequest. In 2022, the DOE started including the lottery number in the students’ admission portal, but it did so only a week before applications were due. For the 2022 admission season, the survey received 253 answers from high-school applicants and 102 answers from middle-school applicants.After a manual data cleaning step to remove obvious errors in data entry, the highest (worst) lottery number of all students who received an offer to a school was extracted: this identifies a lower bound for the school cutoff. To identify the higher bound,the process is similar but needs to consider only students who did not receive an offer to a school they ranked higher than the one to which they matched.Survey participants were asked whether they qualify for FRL(free and reduced lunch, the DOE measure of low-income status)diversity in admissions (DIA) set-asides, and whether their students had a student with disability (SWD) designation. They were given the choice to decline to answer these questions, in which case their answers were processed in the most conservative way to determine cutoffs: for instance, for a student whose FRL status is unknown,their acceptance to a school can only be used to increase the (less restrictive) DIA cutoff lower bound, while their rejection from a school can only be used to lower the (more restrictive) inDIAn cutoff upper-bound. Note that SWD are handled through a separate process, and different designations will have access to different programs. The data analysis does not differentiate among SWDstatuses.It is worth noting that families get no direct benefit from par-ticipating in the survey as information is collected after admission placements are communicated to families. Anecdotal information from parent groups’ discussions shows that participants are mo-tivated by wanting to understand the process better and helping future applicants. After the 2023 admission season, in which lottery numbers were made available to all applicants from the beginning,families requested that the survey be run again, as they had found the previous years’ results useful to create their choice lists. As of the writing of this article (May 2023), the high-school survey for the 2023 admission season has received 647 answers. The crowdsourcing survey’s goal is to gain a better understanding of the admission odds and to potentially identify issues with the process. It is not meant to be exhaustive, the recruitment of par-ticipants was done through online parent groups and mailing list and as a consequence skews toward families that speak English and are well-informed. Survey answers are not representative of the whole applicant population: respondents are clustered in some geo-graphical areas, skew higher income and higher-achieving than the DOE student population. For instance, in 2022, some high schools are using a coarse academic priority grouping to select students with a minimum GPA. All answers to the HS survey reported their student being placed in academic Group 1 for screened school ad-missions (63% of students citywide were placed in Group 1, from data received by CCHS, the Citywide Council on High Schools –selected parent body). This does not impact the correctness of thecutoff information derived from the surveys but does impact the completeness of the information. As such, the results are bound to be incomplete and to miss a large number of schools.Data, such as priority group eligibility, is self-reported by parents,and errors in data entry are possible. The data is sparse, data is missing for many schools, and it is skewed toward some schools and districts (where the survey was shared). In many cases, thecutoff could not be narrowed precisely, so the results only identified a range of lottery numbers where the cutoff falls.Table 1 reports on the statistics of the data generated by each year's survey. The overall school systems statistics are given in the last column but only include data from 2021 and 2022 [11] as the2023 data was not available as of the writing of this article. As noted above, the demographics of survey participants is skewed towards higher-income students and students who do not have disabilities, although the representation of these two categories improved from year to year. Approximately 436 high schools participate in the match (the exact number is not clear as some schools are often added or removed at the last minute; the count was generated from the most recent (2021) High School Directory data [24]. Some Schools have several programs to which students can apply, the survey results differentiate among these programs [22]. The survey data contains information from about a quarter of the schools.4.An interesting data point from Table 1 is the percentage of un-matched students in the dataset. In 2021 and 2022, 7% of students citywide were unmatched. The rate of unmatched survey partici-pants for 2022 is close to the actual citywide rate, but the rate of unmatched survey students for 2021 is much higher. This is likely due to a few reasons:(1) In 2021, families had to FOIL their lottery number to gain access to it. Those who did go through the process were likely to be the ones who were upset at their outcomes and were motivated to understand what happened. In later years,all applicants could see their lottery numbers in the applicant portal.(2) Survey respondents from 2021 were typically from higher-income districts where the rate of unmatched students was 4 It is possible that the proportion of schools to which the survey participants applied is higher, however, we only count schools for which they were considered, i.e., either the school to which they matched, or the schools that they ranked higher than their match higher than the city average (18% in District 2, 12% in District3, 9% in District 15 [11]).5The unmatched rate for the 2023 survey is much lower. Unfortu-nately, the actual unmatched rate is not available as of the writing of this article (May 2023). It is unclear whether the citywide un-matched rate declined, or if survey participants, a self-selected group, most of whom had access to past survey results and were able to tailor their choice list based on their lottery number and past cutoff information, modified their behavior in a way that minimizes their odds of being unmatched. More analysis on possible changes in behavior due to having access to lottery numbers is needed (seeSection 6) Full results and analysis were shared online [22], and made available to NYC families to plan their application. As the details of the odds of admissions at specific schools are not directly relevant to the reader, I will only highlight the main lessons learned from the analysis in this section.• The lottery number had an outsized impact on admissions, including admissions to “screened” schools that considered essays and auditions in their admission process. Several schools used both assessments and grades.Students were ranked on a composite score based on their school-specific assessments (typically essays), and grades. Many students with bad lottery numbers saw these schools as their best hope to get a desirable match, as they could compensate for bad luck in the lottery draw with a strong essay. The results show that essays were graded coarsely, or not at all, and the lottery number was used to break ties, being a major factor in admission for these schools. For instance, to gain admission to Beacon High School, one of the most popular high schools, students needed a perfect 400 assessment score AND a lottery number that started with 6' or lower (a 400 score with a ‘6f’ lottery number was not given an offer). Another school, Manhattan / Hunter Science High School assigned the maximum essay score of 400 to all students who submitted the essay, resulting in students needing a good lottery number (starting with ‘3’ or lower) to gain admission.• The process results in a large amount of wasted time and resources, both on the students’ side and the schoolside. The above results highlight how wasteful in terms of time and resources the process is. Because of the coarseness of the grading, students with no chance of gaining admission to either school because of their bad lottery numbers spent time writing essays and used precious choices on their list for the schools. Meanwhile, teachers spent time grading these essays (at least at Beacon High School), despite the grades not having any impact of these students’ admission chances.• Students are applying to schools for which they are no seats for their priority group. Consider the example of the New Explorations into Science, Technology and Math HighSchool (NEST+m) school, a popular school with thousands of applicants. NEST+m is a K-12 school with priority given to continuing students and a 66% DIA set-aside for low-income students. Historically 53% of offers are given to continu-ing students. However, the demographic data of continuing students shows few students qualifying for the low-income set-aside. Once continuing students, in the top priority group,are given offers, the only remaining seats left are reserved for students who qualify for the set-aside. Non-continuing students who do not qualify for the set-aside have little to no chance of gaining admission to the school. The survey results confirm that fewer than 6 such students received an offer.6 However, students and families are not made aware of this, so hundreds of ineligible students applied, wrote essays,and teachers spent hours grading these essays despite the students having little or no chance of receiving an offer. Hadthis information been available, students might have decided not to include the school as one of their 12 choices, and not to spend the time writing a series of school-specific essays for such low odds.As discussed in Section 2.2, a large number of students ended up not getting matched to any school on their list, especially in one Manhattan district. This was in large part due to pandemic-and diversity-driven changes in admission policy, which greatly reduced the odds of admissions to a number of schools for these students compared to previous years. (Previously, Manhattan students had geographic priority in some selected high-schools, and several high-schools selected students with high GPAs and test scores.) The DOE did not communicate well the impact of the decrease in odds tofamilies.In 2020, the DOE added waitlists to the school match following errors in the match the previous year [6, 33]. Students are automatically added to the waitlist of schools that are higher on their list than the schools to which they matched.The process that had been communicated to families during DOEZoom admission events, and noted on the DOE website stated that:“For waitlists, each applicant receives a new random number for each waitlist they are on.”It would be unfair for students with “bad"" lottery numbers to be penalized twice. The fairest way to handle the waitlists would be to reverse lottery numbers, but redrawing them is a reasonably fair alternative [13]. Students are given the opportunity to add themselves to wait lists of schools they did not list in the main round, but they will have lower priority than students who had listed the schools originally. This unfortunately creates new strategic incentives: a student with a bad main round lottery number may be lucky in the waitlist round and receive a good lottery number at a high-demand school that they wish to attend, but to have a realistic chance of being admitted from the waitlist, they have to list the school in the main round (otherwise their waitlist position will be after all students who have listed the school). Optimizing for waitlists is risky as it requires allocating one (or more) of the 12 choices in the main round for a potential shot at a good waitlist outcome. This will mechanically increase the chances of being unmatched for students who do not have a guaranteed placement. It also requires families to apply complex game theory reasoning to their school application decisions, and evaluate the tradeoffs between the risk of being unmatched and the opportunity for an additional chance in the lottery for their most preferred school(s). Finally, there is very little information as to the odds of admissions from waitlists; many schools seldom admit any students from their waitlists, and others made extensive use of them. However, there is no transparency on the number of students who were admitted from waitlists. Despite the published policy of redrawing lottery numbers, in July 2022 the DOE confirmed what many parents have suspected based on comparing their waitlist numbers: the lottery numbers had not been redrawn for a subset of schools. The reasons for this change in policy were not given. It is possible it was due to some implementation oversight. This change in published policy has two major drawbacks.• Unfairness. Students with bad original random numbers received consistently bad waitlist numbers, students with good original numbers were at the top of many waitlists. This Led to unfair situations where students with good placements in the main round were given multiple waitlist offers to popular schools, while students with no match in the main round had no hope to get an offer. This was an additional blow for students with bad application lottery numbers who had hoped to have better luck in the waitlist process. It also meant many families had wasted some of their choices on false hope.• Negative effect on diversity initiatives. Schools do not keep separate waitlists for students eligible for the low-income set-asides. The mechanics of the set-aside means that the admission lottery cutoffs for DIA-eligible students are higher than those of non-eligible students. Because the lottery numbers are not redrawn for the waitlists, there is now a perverse effect where students at the top of the list are all non-eligible. This means that schools that admit studentsfrom their waitlists are diluting the effect of their diversity initiatives and the percentage of low-income students. ",439-41,families,

As such, the results are bound to be incomplete and to miss a large number of schools.Data, such as priority group eligibility, is self-reported by parents,and errors in data entry are possible. The data is sparse, data is missing for many schools, and it is skewed toward some schools and districts (where the survey was shared). In many cases, thecutoff could not be narrowed precisely, so the results only identified a range of lottery numbers where the cutoff falls.Table 1 reports on the statistics of the data generated by each year's survey. The overall school systems statistics are given in the last column but only include data from 2021 and 2022 [11] as the2023 data was not available as of the writing of this article. As noted above, the demographics of survey participants is skewed towards higher-income students and students who do not have disabilities, although the representation of these two categories improved from year to year. Approximately 436 high schools participate in the match (the exact number is not clear as some schools are often added or removed at the last minute; the count was generated from the most recent (2021) High School Directory data [24]. Some Schools have several programs to which students can apply, the survey results differentiate among these programs [22]. The survey data contains information from about a quarter of the schools.4.An interesting data point from Table 1 is the percentage of un-matched students in the dataset. In 2021 and 2022, 7% of students citywide were unmatched. The rate of unmatched survey partici-pants for 2022 is close to the actual citywide rate, but the rate of unmatched survey students for 2021 is much higher. This is likely due to a few reasons:(1) In 2021, families had to FOIL their lottery number to gain access to it. Those who did go through the process were likely to be the ones who were upset at their outcomes and were motivated to understand what happened. In later years,all applicants could see their lottery numbers in the applicant portal.(2) Survey respondents from 2021 were typically from higher-income districts where the rate of unmatched students was 4 It is possible that the proportion of schools to which the survey participants applied is higher, however, we only count schools for which they were considered, i.e., either the school to which they matched, or the schools that they ranked higher than their match higher than the city average (18% in District 2, 12% in District3, 9% in District 15 [11]).5The unmatched rate for the 2023 survey is much lower. Unfortu-nately, the actual unmatched rate is not available as of the writing of this article (May 2023). It is unclear whether the citywide un-matched rate declined, or if survey participants, a self-selected group, most of whom had access to past survey results and were able to tailor their choice list based on their lottery number and past cutoff information, modified their behavior in a way that minimizes their odds of being unmatched. More analysis on possible changes in behavior due to having access to lottery numbers is needed (seeSection 6) Full results and analysis were shared online [22], and made available to NYC families to plan their application. As the details of the odds of admissions at specific schools are not directly relevant to the reader, I will only highlight the main lessons learned from the analysis in this section.• The lottery number had an outsized impact on admissions, including admissions to “screened” schools that considered essays and auditions in their admission process. Several schools used both assessments and grades.Students were ranked on a composite score based on their school-specific assessments (typically essays), and grades. Many students with bad lottery numbers saw these schools as their best hope to get a desirable match, as they could compensate for bad luck in the lottery draw with a strong essay. The results show that essays were graded coarsely, or not at all, and the lottery number was used to break ties, being a major factor in admission for these schools. For instance, to gain admission to Beacon High School, one of the most popular high schools, students needed a perfect 400 assessment score AND a lottery number that started with 6' or lower (a 400 score with a ‘6f’ lottery number was not given an offer). Another school, Manhattan / Hunter Science High School assigned the maximum essay score of 400 to all students who submitted the essay, resulting in students needing a good lottery number (starting with ‘3’ or lower) to gain admission.• The process results in a large amount of wasted time and resources, both on the students’ side and the schoolside. The above results highlight how wasteful in terms of time and resources the process is. Because of the coarseness of the grading, students with no chance of gaining admission to either school because of their bad lottery numbers spent time writing essays and used precious choices on their list for the schools. Meanwhile, teachers spent time grading these essays (at least at Beacon High School), despite the grades not having any impact of these students’ admission chances.• Students are applying to schools for which they are no seats for their priority group. Consider the example of the New Explorations into Science, Technology and Math HighSchool (NEST+m) school, a popular school with thousands of applicants. NEST+m is a K-12 school with priority given to continuing students and a 66% DIA set-aside for low-income students. Historically 53% of offers are given to continu-ing students. However, the demographic data of continuing students shows few students qualifying for the low-income set-aside. Once continuing students, in the top priority group,are given offers, the only remaining seats left are reserved for students who qualify for the set-aside. Non-continuing students who do not qualify for the set-aside have little to no chance of gaining admission to the school. The survey results confirm that fewer than 6 such students received an offer.6 However, students and families are not made aware of this, so hundreds of ineligible students applied, wrote essays,and teachers spent hours grading these essays despite the students having little or no chance of receiving an offer. Hadthis information been available, students might have decided not to include the school as one of their 12 choices, and not to spend the time writing a series of school-specific essays for such low odds.As discussed in Section 2.2, a large number of students ended up not getting matched to any school on their list, especially in one Manhattan district. This was in large part due to pandemic-and diversity-driven changes in admission policy, which greatly reduced the odds of admissions to a number of schools for these students compared to previous years. (Previously, Manhattan students had geographic priority in some selected high-schools, and several high-schools selected students with high GPAs and test scores.) The DOE did not communicate well the impact of the decrease in odds tofamilies.In 2020, the DOE added waitlists to the school match following errors in the match the previous year [6, 33]. Students are automatically added to the waitlist of schools that are higher on their list than the schools to which they matched.The process that had been communicated to families during DOEZoom admission events, and noted on the DOE website stated that:“For waitlists, each applicant receives a new random number for each waitlist they are on.”It would be unfair for students with “bad"" lottery numbers to be penalized twice. The fairest way to handle the waitlists would be to reverse lottery numbers, but redrawing them is a reasonably fair alternative [13]. Students are given the opportunity to add themselves to wait lists of schools they did not list in the main round, but they will have lower priority than students who had listed the schools originally. This unfortunately creates new strategic incentives: a student with a bad main round lottery number may be lucky in the waitlist round and receive a good lottery number at a high-demand school that they wish to attend, but to have a realistic chance of being admitted from the waitlist, they have to list the school in the main round (otherwise their waitlist position will be after all students who have listed the school). Optimizing for waitlists is risky as it requires allocating one (or more) of the 12 choices in the main round for a potential shot at a good waitlist outcome. This will mechanically increase the chances of being unmatched for students who do not have a guaranteed placement. It also requires families to apply complex game theory reasoning to their school application decisions, and evaluate the tradeoffs between the risk of being unmatched and the opportunity for an additional chance in the lottery for their most preferred school(s). Finally, there is very little information as to the odds of admissions from waitlists; many schools seldom admit any students from their waitlists, and others made extensive use of them. However, there is no transparency on the number of students who were admitted from waitlists. Despite the published policy of redrawing lottery numbers, in July 2022 the DOE confirmed what many parents have suspected based on comparing their waitlist numbers: the lottery numbers had not been redrawn for a subset of schools. The reasons for this change in policy were not given. It is possible it was due to some implementation oversight. This change in published policy has two major drawbacks.• Unfairness. Students with bad original random numbers received consistently bad waitlist numbers, students with good original numbers were at the top of many waitlists. This Led to unfair situations where students with good placements in the main round were given multiple waitlist offers to popular schools, while students with no match in the main round had no hope to get an offer. This was an additional blow for students with bad application lottery numbers who had hoped to have better luck in the waitlist process. It also meant many families had wasted some of their choices on false hope.• Negative effect on diversity initiatives. Schools do not keep separate waitlists for students eligible for the low-income set-asides. The mechanics of the set-aside means that the admission lottery cutoffs for DIA-eligible students are higher than those of non-eligible students. Because the lottery numbers are not redrawn for the waitlists, there is now a perverse effect where students at the top of the list are all non-eligible. This means that schools that admit studentsfrom their waitlists are diluting the effect of their diversity initiatives and the percentage of low-income students. ",439-41,motivated by wanting to understand the process better and helping future applicants,
12,SkewTowardEnglishSpeakers,Causal_Theory,"To identify the cutoffs to gain admissions to various middle- and high-schools, I used a crowdsourcing survey where families were asked to enter their lottery number (only the first two characters to preserve anonymity), the school to which they matched, and the schools they ranked higher than their match. They were also asked to enter information on which priority group their students qualified for. The survey was done via Google Forms, answers were kept completely anonymous, and no identifying (or re-identifying)information was requested. The survey was approved by Rutgers Institutional Review Board. Participants were recruited through messages on social media parent groups.The survey result data was used to identify the “worst” lottery number that received an offer to the school, and the “best” that did not. The corresponding percentile in the theoretical distribution was used to get a lower and upper bound of the odds of matching to a given school. Note that these odds represent chances of matching to a given school or to a school ranked higher on the student list, as the matching algorithm will only consider a student for a school if they haven’t matched to a school they ranked higher.The full results of the surveys were published online [22], allow-ing families applying in later years to have a better idea of the odds of admissions at their preferred schools and to adjust their ranked list accordingly. For the 2021 admission season, the survey received 136 (107 with lottery numbers) answers from high-school applicants and 125 (70 with lottery numbers) answers from middle-school ap-plicants. Note that in 2021 the DOE did not provide families with their lottery number, accessing it required parents to file a FOILrequest. In 2022, the DOE started including the lottery number in the students’ admission portal, but it did so only a week before applications were due. For the 2022 admission season, the survey received 253 answers from high-school applicants and 102 answers from middle-school applicants.After a manual data cleaning step to remove obvious errors in data entry, the highest (worst) lottery number of all students who received an offer to a school was extracted: this identifies a lower bound for the school cutoff. To identify the higher bound,the process is similar but needs to consider only students who did not receive an offer to a school they ranked higher than the one to which they matched.Survey participants were asked whether they qualify for FRL(free and reduced lunch, the DOE measure of low-income status)diversity in admissions (DIA) set-asides, and whether their students had a student with disability (SWD) designation. They were given the choice to decline to answer these questions, in which case their answers were processed in the most conservative way to determine cutoffs: for instance, for a student whose FRL status is unknown,their acceptance to a school can only be used to increase the (less restrictive) DIA cutoff lower bound, while their rejection from a school can only be used to lower the (more restrictive) inDIAn cutoff upper-bound. Note that SWD are handled through a separate process, and different designations will have access to different programs. The data analysis does not differentiate among SWDstatuses.It is worth noting that families get no direct benefit from par-ticipating in the survey as information is collected after admission placements are communicated to families. Anecdotal information from parent groups’ discussions shows that participants are mo-tivated by wanting to understand the process better and helping future applicants. After the 2023 admission season, in which lottery numbers were made available to all applicants from the beginning,families requested that the survey be run again, as they had found the previous years’ results useful to create their choice lists. As of the writing of this article (May 2023), the high-school survey for the 2023 admission season has received 647 answers. The crowdsourcing survey’s goal is to gain a better understanding of the admission odds and to potentially identify issues with the process. It is not meant to be exhaustive, the recruitment of par-ticipants was done through online parent groups and mailing list and as a consequence skews toward families that speak English and are well-informed. Survey answers are not representative of the whole applicant population: respondents are clustered in some geo-graphical areas, skew higher income and higher-achieving than the DOE student population. For instance, in 2022, some high schools are using a coarse academic priority grouping to select students with a minimum GPA. All answers to the HS survey reported their student being placed in academic Group 1 for screened school ad-missions (63% of students citywide were placed in Group 1, from data received by CCHS, the Citywide Council on High Schools –selected parent body).

NEST+m is a K-12 school with priority given to continuing students and a 66% DIA set-aside for low-income students. Historically 53% of offers are given to continu-ing students. However, the demographic data of continuing students shows few students qualifying for the low-income set-aside. Once continuing students, in the top priority group,are given offers, the only remaining seats left are reserved for students who qualify for the set-aside. Non-continuing students who do not qualify for the set-aside have little to no chance of gaining admission to the school. The survey results confirm that fewer than 6 such students received an offer.6 However, students and families are not made aware of this, so hundreds of ineligible students applied, wrote essays,and teachers spent hours grading these essays despite the students having little or no chance of receiving an offer. Hadthis information been available, students might have decided not to include the school as one of their 12 choices, and not to spend the time writing a series of school-specific essays for such low odds.As discussed in Section 2.2, a large number of students ended up not getting matched to any school on their list, especially in one Manhattan district. This was in large part due to pandemic-and diversity-driven changes in admission policy, which greatly reduced the odds of admissions to a number of schools for these students compared to previous years. (Previously, Manhattan students had geographic priority in some selected high-schools, and several high-schools selected students with high GPAs and test scores.) The DOE did not communicate well the impact of the decrease in odds tofamilies.In 2020, the DOE added waitlists to the school match following errors in the match the previous year [6, 33]. Students are automatically added to the waitlist of schools that are higher on their list than the schools to which they matched.The process that had been communicated to families during DOEZoom admission events, and noted on the DOE website stated that:“For waitlists, each applicant receives a new random number for each waitlist they are on.”It would be unfair for students with “bad"" lottery numbers to be penalized twice. The fairest way to handle the waitlists would be to reverse lottery numbers, but redrawing them is a reasonably fair alternative [13]. Students are given the opportunity to add themselves to wait lists of schools they did not list in the main round, but they will have lower priority than students who had listed the schools originally. This unfortunately creates new strategic incentives: a student with a bad main round lottery number may be lucky in the waitlist round and receive a good lottery number at a high-demand school that they wish to attend, but to have a realistic chance of being admitted from the waitlist, they have to list the school in the main round (otherwise their waitlist position will be after all students who have listed the school). Optimizing for waitlists is risky as it requires allocating one (or more) of the 12 choices in the main round for a potential shot at a good waitlist outcome. This will mechanically increase the chances of being unmatched for students who do not have a guaranteed placement. It also requires families to apply complex game theory reasoning to their school application decisions, and evaluate the tradeoffs between the risk of being unmatched and the opportunity for an additional chance in the lottery for their most preferred school(s). Finally, there is very little information as to the odds of admissions from waitlists; many schools seldom admit any students from their waitlists, and others made extensive use of them. However, there is no transparency on the number of students who were admitted from waitlists. Despite the published policy of redrawing lottery numbers, in July 2022 the DOE confirmed what many parents have suspected based on comparing their waitlist numbers: the lottery numbers had not been redrawn for a subset of schools. The reasons for this change in policy were not given. It is possible it was due to some implementation oversight. This change in published policy has two major drawbacks.• Unfairness. Students with bad original random numbers received consistently bad waitlist numbers, students with good original numbers were at the top of many waitlists. This Led to unfair situations where students with good placements in the main round were given multiple waitlist offers to popular schools, while students with no match in the main round had no hope to get an offer. This was an additional blow for students with bad application lottery numbers who had hoped to have better luck in the waitlist process. It also meant many families had wasted some of their choices on false hope.• Negative effect on diversity initiatives. Schools do not keep separate waitlists for students eligible for the low-income set-asides. The mechanics of the set-aside means that the admission lottery cutoffs for DIA-eligible students are higher than those of non-eligible students. Because the lottery numbers are not redrawn for the waitlists, there is now a perverse effect where students at the top of the list are all non-eligible. This means that schools that admit studentsfrom their waitlists are diluting the effect of their diversity initiatives and the percentage of low-income students. ",439-41,the demographics of survey participants is skewed [...] towards higher-income students,
14,SkewTowardsNonDisabled,Causal_Theory,"To identify the cutoffs to gain admissions to various middle- and high-schools, I used a crowdsourcing survey where families were asked to enter their lottery number (only the first two characters to preserve anonymity), the school to which they matched, and the schools they ranked higher than their match. They were also asked to enter information on which priority group their students qualified for. The survey was done via Google Forms, answers were kept completely anonymous, and no identifying (or re-identifying)information was requested. The survey was approved by Rutgers Institutional Review Board. Participants were recruited through messages on social media parent groups.The survey result data was used to identify the “worst” lottery number that received an offer to the school, and the “best” that did not. The corresponding percentile in the theoretical distribution was used to get a lower and upper bound of the odds of matching to a given school. Note that these odds represent chances of matching to a given school or to a school ranked higher on the student list, as the matching algorithm will only consider a student for a school if they haven’t matched to a school they ranked higher.The full results of the surveys were published online [22], allow-ing families applying in later years to have a better idea of the odds of admissions at their preferred schools and to adjust their ranked list accordingly. For the 2021 admission season, the survey received 136 (107 with lottery numbers) answers from high-school applicants and 125 (70 with lottery numbers) answers from middle-school ap-plicants. Note that in 2021 the DOE did not provide families with their lottery number, accessing it required parents to file a FOILrequest. In 2022, the DOE started including the lottery number in the students’ admission portal, but it did so only a week before applications were due. For the 2022 admission season, the survey received 253 answers from high-school applicants and 102 answers from middle-school applicants.After a manual data cleaning step to remove obvious errors in data entry, the highest (worst) lottery number of all students who received an offer to a school was extracted: this identifies a lower bound for the school cutoff. To identify the higher bound,the process is similar but needs to consider only students who did not receive an offer to a school they ranked higher than the one to which they matched.Survey participants were asked whether they qualify for FRL(free and reduced lunch, the DOE measure of low-income status)diversity in admissions (DIA) set-asides, and whether their students had a student with disability (SWD) designation. They were given the choice to decline to answer these questions, in which case their answers were processed in the most conservative way to determine cutoffs: for instance, for a student whose FRL status is unknown,their acceptance to a school can only be used to increase the (less restrictive) DIA cutoff lower bound, while their rejection from a school can only be used to lower the (more restrictive) inDIAn cutoff upper-bound. Note that SWD are handled through a separate process, and different designations will have access to different programs. The data analysis does not differentiate among SWDstatuses.It is worth noting that families get no direct benefit from par-ticipating in the survey as information is collected after admission placements are communicated to families. Anecdotal information from parent groups’ discussions shows that participants are mo-tivated by wanting to understand the process better and helping future applicants. After the 2023 admission season, in which lottery numbers were made available to all applicants from the beginning,families requested that the survey be run again, as they had found the previous years’ results useful to create their choice lists. As of the writing of this article (May 2023), the high-school survey for the 2023 admission season has received 647 answers. The crowdsourcing survey’s goal is to gain a better understanding of the admission odds and to potentially identify issues with the process. It is not meant to be exhaustive, the recruitment of par-ticipants was done through online parent groups and mailing list and as a consequence skews toward families that speak English and are well-informed. Survey answers are not representative of the whole applicant population: respondents are clustered in some geo-graphical areas, skew higher income and higher-achieving than the DOE student population. For instance, in 2022, some high schools are using a coarse academic priority grouping to select students with a minimum GPA. All answers to the HS survey reported their student being placed in academic Group 1 for screened school ad-missions (63% of students citywide were placed in Group 1, from data received by CCHS, the Citywide Council on High Schools –selected parent body). This does not impact the correctness of thecutoff information derived from the surveys but does impact the completeness of the information. As such, the results are bound to be incomplete and to miss a large number of schools.Data, such as priority group eligibility, is self-reported by parents,and errors in data entry are possible. The data is sparse, data is missing for many schools, and it is skewed toward some schools and districts (where the survey was shared). In many cases, thecutoff could not be narrowed precisely, so the results only identified a range of lottery numbers where the cutoff falls.Table 1 reports on the statistics of the data generated by each year's survey. The overall school systems statistics are given in the last column but only include data from 2021 and 2022 [11] as the2023 data was not available as of the writing of this article. As noted above, the demographics of survey participants is skewed towards higher-income students and students who do not have disabilities, although the representation of these two categories improved from year to year. Approximately 436 high schools participate in the match (the exact number is not clear as some schools are often added or removed at the last minute; the count was generated from the most recent (2021) High School Directory data [24]. Some Schools have several programs to which students can apply, the survey results differentiate among these programs [22]. The survey data contains information from about a quarter of the schools.4.An interesting data point from Table 1 is the percentage of un-matched students in the dataset. In 2021 and 2022, 7% of students citywide were unmatched. The rate of unmatched survey partici-pants for 2022 is close to the actual citywide rate, but the rate of unmatched survey students for 2021 is much higher. This is likely due to a few reasons:(1) In 2021, families had to FOIL their lottery number to gain access to it. Those who did go through the process were likely to be the ones who were upset at their outcomes and were motivated to understand what happened. In later years,all applicants could see their lottery numbers in the applicant portal.(2) Survey respondents from 2021 were typically from higher-income districts where the rate of unmatched students was 4 It is possible that the proportion of schools to which the survey participants applied is higher, however, we only count schools for which they were considered, i.e., either the school to which they matched, or the schools that they ranked higher than their match higher than the city average (18% in District 2, 12% in District3, 9% in District 15 [11]).5The unmatched rate for the 2023 survey is much lower. Unfortu-nately, the actual unmatched rate is not available as of the writing of this article (May 2023). It is unclear whether the citywide un-matched rate declined, or if survey participants, a self-selected group, most of whom had access to past survey results and were able to tailor their choice list based on their lottery number and past cutoff information, modified their behavior in a way that minimizes their odds of being unmatched. More analysis on possible changes in behavior due to having access to lottery numbers is needed (seeSection 6) Full results and analysis were shared online [22], and made available to NYC families to plan their application. As the details of the odds of admissions at specific schools are not directly relevant to the reader, I will only highlight the main lessons learned from the analysis in this section.• The lottery number had an outsized impact on admissions, including admissions to “screened” schools that considered essays and auditions in their admission process. Several schools used both assessments and grades.Students were ranked on a composite score based on their school-specific assessments (typically essays), and grades. Many students with bad lottery numbers saw these schools as their best hope to get a desirable match, as they could compensate for bad luck in the lottery draw with a strong essay. The results show that essays were graded coarsely, or not at all, and the lottery number was used to break ties, being a major factor in admission for these schools. For instance, to gain admission to Beacon High School, one of the most popular high schools, students needed a perfect 400 assessment score AND a lottery number that started with 6' or lower (a 400 score with a ‘6f’ lottery number was not given an offer). Another school, Manhattan / Hunter Science High School assigned the maximum essay score of 400 to all students who submitted the essay, resulting in students needing a good lottery number (starting with ‘3’ or lower) to gain admission.• The process results in a large amount of wasted time and resources, both on the students’ side and the schoolside. The above results highlight how wasteful in terms of time and resources the process is. Because of the coarseness of the grading, students with no chance of gaining admission to either school because of their bad lottery numbers spent time writing essays and used precious choices on their list for the schools. Meanwhile, teachers spent time grading these essays (at least at Beacon High School), despite the grades not having any impact of these students’ admission chances.• Students are applying to schools for which they are no seats for their priority group. Consider the example of the New Explorations into Science, Technology and Math HighSchool (NEST+m) school, a popular school with thousands of applicants. NEST+m is a K-12 school with priority given to continuing students and a 66% DIA set-aside for low-income students. Historically 53% of offers are given to continu-ing students. However, the demographic data of continuing students shows few students qualifying for the low-income set-aside. Once continuing students, in the top priority group,are given offers, the only remaining seats left are reserved for students who qualify for the set-aside.

The survey was done via Google Forms, answers were kept completely anonymous, and no identifying (or re-identifying)information was requested. The survey was approved by Rutgers Institutional Review Board. Participants were recruited through messages on social media parent groups.The survey result data was used to identify the “worst” lottery number that received an offer to the school, and the “best” that did not. The corresponding percentile in the theoretical distribution was used to get a lower and upper bound of the odds of matching to a given school. Note that these odds represent chances of matching to a given school or to a school ranked higher on the student list, as the matching algorithm will only consider a student for a school if they haven’t matched to a school they ranked higher.The full results of the surveys were published online [22], allow-ing families applying in later years to have a better idea of the odds of admissions at their preferred schools and to adjust their ranked list accordingly. For the 2021 admission season, the survey received 136 (107 with lottery numbers) answers from high-school applicants and 125 (70 with lottery numbers) answers from middle-school ap-plicants. Note that in 2021 the DOE did not provide families with their lottery number, accessing it required parents to file a FOILrequest. In 2022, the DOE started including the lottery number in the students’ admission portal, but it did so only a week before applications were due. For the 2022 admission season, the survey received 253 answers from high-school applicants and 102 answers from middle-school applicants.After a manual data cleaning step to remove obvious errors in data entry, the highest (worst) lottery number of all students who received an offer to a school was extracted: this identifies a lower bound for the school cutoff. To identify the higher bound,the process is similar but needs to consider only students who did not receive an offer to a school they ranked higher than the one to which they matched.Survey participants were asked whether they qualify for FRL(free and reduced lunch, the DOE measure of low-income status)diversity in admissions (DIA) set-asides, and whether their students had a student with disability (SWD) designation. They were given the choice to decline to answer these questions, in which case their answers were processed in the most conservative way to determine cutoffs: for instance, for a student whose FRL status is unknown,their acceptance to a school can only be used to increase the (less restrictive) DIA cutoff lower bound, while their rejection from a school can only be used to lower the (more restrictive) inDIAn cutoff upper-bound. Note that SWD are handled through a separate process, and different designations will have access to different programs. The data analysis does not differentiate among SWDstatuses.It is worth noting that families get no direct benefit from par-ticipating in the survey as information is collected after admission placements are communicated to families. Anecdotal information from parent groups’ discussions shows that participants are mo-tivated by wanting to understand the process better and helping future applicants. After the 2023 admission season, in which lottery numbers were made available to all applicants from the beginning,families requested that the survey be run again, as they had found the previous years’ results useful to create their choice lists. As of the writing of this article (May 2023), the high-school survey for the 2023 admission season has received 647 answers. The crowdsourcing survey’s goal is to gain a better understanding of the admission odds and to potentially identify issues with the process. It is not meant to be exhaustive, the recruitment of par-ticipants was done through online parent groups and mailing list and as a consequence skews toward families that speak English and are well-informed. Survey answers are not representative of the whole applicant population: respondents are clustered in some geo-graphical areas, skew higher income and higher-achieving than the DOE student population. For instance, in 2022, some high schools are using a coarse academic priority grouping to select students with a minimum GPA. All answers to the HS survey reported their student being placed in academic Group 1 for screened school ad-missions (63% of students citywide were placed in Group 1, from data received by CCHS, the Citywide Council on High Schools –selected parent body). This does not impact the correctness of thecutoff information derived from the surveys but does impact the completeness of the information. As such, the results are bound to be incomplete and to miss a large number of schools.Data, such as priority group eligibility, is self-reported by parents,and errors in data entry are possible. The data is sparse, data is missing for many schools, and it is skewed toward some schools and districts (where the survey was shared). In many cases, thecutoff could not be narrowed precisely, so the results only identified a range of lottery numbers where the cutoff falls.Table 1 reports on the statistics of the data generated by each year's survey. The overall school systems statistics are given in the last column but only include data from 2021 and 2022 [11] as the2023 data was not available as of the writing of this article. As noted above, the demographics of survey participants is skewed towards higher-income students and students who do not have disabilities, although the representation of these two categories improved from year to year. Approximately 436 high schools participate in the match (the exact number is not clear as some schools are often added or removed at the last minute; the count was generated from the most recent (2021) High School Directory data [24]. Some Schools have several programs to which students can apply, the survey results differentiate among these programs [22]. The survey data contains information from about a quarter of the schools.4.An interesting data point from Table 1 is the percentage of un-matched students in the dataset. In 2021 and 2022, 7% of students citywide were unmatched. The rate of unmatched survey partici-pants for 2022 is close to the actual citywide rate, but the rate of unmatched survey students for 2021 is much higher. This is likely due to a few reasons:(1) In 2021, families had to FOIL their lottery number to gain access to it. Those who did go through the process were likely to be the ones who were upset at their outcomes and were motivated to understand what happened. In later years,all applicants could see their lottery numbers in the applicant portal.(2) Survey respondents from 2021 were typically from higher-income districts where the rate of unmatched students was 4 It is possible that the proportion of schools to which the survey participants applied is higher, however, we only count schools for which they were considered, i.e., either the school to which they matched, or the schools that they ranked higher than their match higher than the city average (18% in District 2, 12% in District3, 9% in District 15 [11]).5The unmatched rate for the 2023 survey is much lower. Unfortu-nately, the actual unmatched rate is not available as of the writing of this article (May 2023). It is unclear whether the citywide un-matched rate declined, or if survey participants, a self-selected group, most of whom had access to past survey results and were able to tailor their choice list based on their lottery number and past cutoff information, modified their behavior in a way that minimizes their odds of being unmatched. More analysis on possible changes in behavior due to having access to lottery numbers is needed (seeSection 6) Full results and analysis were shared online [22], and made available to NYC families to plan their application. As the details of the odds of admissions at specific schools are not directly relevant to the reader, I will only highlight the main lessons learned from the analysis in this section.• The lottery number had an outsized impact on admissions, including admissions to “screened” schools that considered essays and auditions in their admission process. Several schools used both assessments and grades.Students were ranked on a composite score based on their school-specific assessments (typically essays), and grades. Many students with bad lottery numbers saw these schools as their best hope to get a desirable match, as they could compensate for bad luck in the lottery draw with a strong essay. The results show that essays were graded coarsely, or not at all, and the lottery number was used to break ties, being a major factor in admission for these schools. For instance, to gain admission to Beacon High School, one of the most popular high schools, students needed a perfect 400 assessment score AND a lottery number that started with 6' or lower (a 400 score with a ‘6f’ lottery number was not given an offer). Another school, Manhattan / Hunter Science High School assigned the maximum essay score of 400 to all students who submitted the essay, resulting in students needing a good lottery number (starting with ‘3’ or lower) to gain admission.• The process results in a large amount of wasted time and resources, both on the students’ side and the schoolside. The above results highlight how wasteful in terms of time and resources the process is. Because of the coarseness of the grading, students with no chance of gaining admission to either school because of their bad lottery numbers spent time writing essays and used precious choices on their list for the schools. Meanwhile, teachers spent time grading these essays (at least at Beacon High School), despite the grades not having any impact of these students’ admission chances.• Students are applying to schools for which they are no seats for their priority group. Consider the example of the New Explorations into Science, Technology and Math HighSchool (NEST+m) school, a popular school with thousands of applicants. NEST+m is a K-12 school with priority given to continuing students and a 66% DIA set-aside for low-income students. Historically 53% of offers are given to continu-ing students. However, the demographic data of continuing students shows few students qualifying for the low-income set-aside. Once continuing students, in the top priority group,are given offers, the only remaining seats left are reserved for students who qualify for the set-aside. Non-continuing students who do not qualify for the set-aside have little to no chance of gaining admission to the school. The survey results confirm that fewer than 6 such students received an offer.6 However, students and families are not made aware of this, so hundreds of ineligible students applied, wrote essays,and teachers spent hours grading these essays despite the students having little or no chance of receiving an offer. Hadthis information been available, students might have decided not to include the school as one of their 12 choices, and not to spend the time writing a series of school-specific essays for such low odds.As discussed in Section 2.2, a large number of students ended up not getting matched to any school on their list, especially in one Manhattan district. This was in large part due to pandemic-and diversity-driven changes in admission policy, which greatly reduced the odds of admissions to a number of schools for these students compared to previous years. (Previously, Manhattan students had geographic priority in some selected high-schools, and several high-schools selected students with high GPAs and test scores.) The DOE did not communicate well the impact of the decrease in odds tofamilies.In 2020, the DOE added waitlists to the school match following errors in the match the previous year [6, 33]. Students are automatically added to the waitlist of schools that are higher on their list than the schools to which they matched.The process that had been communicated to families during DOEZoom admission events, and noted on the DOE website stated that:“For waitlists, each applicant receives a new random number for each waitlist they are on.”It would be unfair for students with “bad"" lottery numbers to be penalized twice. The fairest way to handle the waitlists would be to reverse lottery numbers, but redrawing them is a reasonably fair alternative [13]. Students are given the opportunity to add themselves to wait lists of schools they did not list in the main round, but they will have lower priority than students who had listed the schools originally. This unfortunately creates new strategic incentives: a student with a bad main round lottery number may be lucky in the waitlist round and receive a good lottery number at a high-demand school that they wish to attend, but to have a realistic chance of being admitted from the waitlist, they have to list the school in the main round (otherwise their waitlist position will be after all students who have listed the school). Optimizing for waitlists is risky as it requires allocating one (or more) of the 12 choices in the main round for a potential shot at a good waitlist outcome. This will mechanically increase the chances of being unmatched for students who do not have a guaranteed placement. It also requires families to apply complex game theory reasoning to their school application decisions, and evaluate the tradeoffs between the risk of being unmatched and the opportunity for an additional chance in the lottery for their most preferred school(s). Finally, there is very little information as to the odds of admissions from waitlists; many schools seldom admit any students from their waitlists, and others made extensive use of them. However, there is no transparency on the number of students who were admitted from waitlists. Despite the published policy of redrawing lottery numbers, in July 2022 the DOE confirmed what many parents have suspected based on comparing their waitlist numbers: the lottery numbers had not been redrawn for a subset of schools. The reasons for this change in policy were not given. It is possible it was due to some implementation oversight. This change in published policy has two major drawbacks.• Unfairness. Students with bad original random numbers received consistently bad waitlist numbers, students with good original numbers were at the top of many waitlists. This Led to unfair situations where students with good placements in the main round were given multiple waitlist offers to popular schools, while students with no match in the main round had no hope to get an offer. This was an additional blow for students with bad application lottery numbers who had hoped to have better luck in the waitlist process. It also meant many families had wasted some of their choices on false hope.• Negative effect on diversity initiatives. Schools do not keep separate waitlists for students eligible for the low-income set-asides. The mechanics of the set-aside means that the admission lottery cutoffs for DIA-eligible students are higher than those of non-eligible students. Because the lottery numbers are not redrawn for the waitlists, there is now a perverse effect where students at the top of the list are all non-eligible. This means that schools that admit studentsfrom their waitlists are diluting the effect of their diversity initiatives and the percentage of low-income students.

The overall school systems statistics are given in the last column but only include data from 2021 and 2022 [11] as the2023 data was not available as of the writing of this article. As noted above, the demographics of survey participants is skewed towards higher-income students and students who do not have disabilities, although the representation of these two categories improved from year to year. Approximately 436 high schools participate in the match (the exact number is not clear as some schools are often added or removed at the last minute; the count was generated from the most recent (2021) High School Directory data [24]. Some Schools have several programs to which students can apply, the survey results differentiate among these programs [22]. The survey data contains information from about a quarter of the schools.4.An interesting data point from Table 1 is the percentage of un-matched students in the dataset. In 2021 and 2022, 7% of students citywide were unmatched. The rate of unmatched survey partici-pants for 2022 is close to the actual citywide rate, but the rate of unmatched survey students for 2021 is much higher. This is likely due to a few reasons:(1) In 2021, families had to FOIL their lottery number to gain access to it. Those who did go through the process were likely to be the ones who were upset at their outcomes and were motivated to understand what happened. In later years,all applicants could see their lottery numbers in the applicant portal.(2) Survey respondents from 2021 were typically from higher-income districts where the rate of unmatched students was 4 It is possible that the proportion of schools to which the survey participants applied is higher, however, we only count schools for which they were considered, i.e., either the school to which they matched, or the schools that they ranked higher than their match higher than the city average (18% in District 2, 12% in District3, 9% in District 15 [11]).5The unmatched rate for the 2023 survey is much lower. Unfortu-nately, the actual unmatched rate is not available as of the writing of this article (May 2023). It is unclear whether the citywide un-matched rate declined, or if survey participants, a self-selected group, most of whom had access to past survey results and were able to tailor their choice list based on their lottery number and past cutoff information, modified their behavior in a way that minimizes their odds of being unmatched. More analysis on possible changes in behavior due to having access to lottery numbers is needed (seeSection 6) Full results and analysis were shared online [22], and made available to NYC families to plan their application. As the details of the odds of admissions at specific schools are not directly relevant to the reader, I will only highlight the main lessons learned from the analysis in this section.• The lottery number had an outsized impact on admissions, including admissions to “screened” schools that considered essays and auditions in their admission process. Several schools used both assessments and grades.Students were ranked on a composite score based on their school-specific assessments (typically essays), and grades. Many students with bad lottery numbers saw these schools as their best hope to get a desirable match, as they could compensate for bad luck in the lottery draw with a strong essay. The results show that essays were graded coarsely, or not at all, and the lottery number was used to break ties, being a major factor in admission for these schools. For instance, to gain admission to Beacon High School, one of the most popular high schools, students needed a perfect 400 assessment score AND a lottery number that started with 6' or lower (a 400 score with a ‘6f’ lottery number was not given an offer). Another school, Manhattan / Hunter Science High School assigned the maximum essay score of 400 to all students who submitted the essay, resulting in students needing a good lottery number (starting with ‘3’ or lower) to gain admission.• The process results in a large amount of wasted time and resources, both on the students’ side and the schoolside. The above results highlight how wasteful in terms of time and resources the process is. Because of the coarseness of the grading, students with no chance of gaining admission to either school because of their bad lottery numbers spent time writing essays and used precious choices on their list for the schools. Meanwhile, teachers spent time grading these essays (at least at Beacon High School), despite the grades not having any impact of these students’ admission chances.• Students are applying to schools for which they are no seats for their priority group. Consider the example of the New Explorations into Science, Technology and Math HighSchool (NEST+m) school, a popular school with thousands of applicants. NEST+m is a K-12 school with priority given to continuing students and a 66% DIA set-aside for low-income students. Historically 53% of offers are given to continu-ing students. However, the demographic data of continuing students shows few students qualifying for the low-income set-aside. Once continuing students, in the top priority group,are given offers, the only remaining seats left are reserved for students who qualify for the set-aside. Non-continuing students who do not qualify for the set-aside have little to no chance of gaining admission to the school. The survey results confirm that fewer than 6 such students received an offer.6 However, students and families are not made aware of this, so hundreds of ineligible students applied, wrote essays,and teachers spent hours grading these essays despite the students having little or no chance of receiving an offer. Hadthis information been available, students might have decided not to include the school as one of their 12 choices, and not to spend the time writing a series of school-specific essays for such low odds.As discussed in Section 2.2, a large number of students ended up not getting matched to any school on their list, especially in one Manhattan district. This was in large part due to pandemic-and diversity-driven changes in admission policy, which greatly reduced the odds of admissions to a number of schools for these students compared to previous years. (Previously, Manhattan students had geographic priority in some selected high-schools, and several high-schools selected students with high GPAs and test scores.) The DOE did not communicate well the impact of the decrease in odds tofamilies.In 2020, the DOE added waitlists to the school match following errors in the match the previous year [6, 33]. Students are automatically added to the waitlist of schools that are higher on their list than the schools to which they matched.The process that had been communicated to families during DOEZoom admission events, and noted on the DOE website stated that:“For waitlists, each applicant receives a new random number for each waitlist they are on.”It would be unfair for students with “bad"" lottery numbers to be penalized twice. The fairest way to handle the waitlists would be to reverse lottery numbers, but redrawing them is a reasonably fair alternative [13]. Students are given the opportunity to add themselves to wait lists of schools they did not list in the main round, but they will have lower priority than students who had listed the schools originally. This unfortunately creates new strategic incentives: a student with a bad main round lottery number may be lucky in the waitlist round and receive a good lottery number at a high-demand school that they wish to attend, but to have a realistic chance of being admitted from the waitlist, they have to list the school in the main round (otherwise their waitlist position will be after all students who have listed the school). Optimizing for waitlists is risky as it requires allocating one (or more) of the 12 choices in the main round for a potential shot at a good waitlist outcome. This will mechanically increase the chances of being unmatched for students who do not have a guaranteed placement. It also requires families to apply complex game theory reasoning to their school application decisions, and evaluate the tradeoffs between the risk of being unmatched and the opportunity for an additional chance in the lottery for their most preferred school(s). Finally, there is very little information as to the odds of admissions from waitlists; many schools seldom admit any students from their waitlists, and others made extensive use of them. However, there is no transparency on the number of students who were admitted from waitlists. Despite the published policy of redrawing lottery numbers, in July 2022 the DOE confirmed what many parents have suspected based on comparing their waitlist numbers: the lottery numbers had not been redrawn for a subset of schools. The reasons for this change in policy were not given. It is possible it was due to some implementation oversight. This change in published policy has two major drawbacks.• Unfairness. Students with bad original random numbers received consistently bad waitlist numbers, students with good original numbers were at the top of many waitlists. This Led to unfair situations where students with good placements in the main round were given multiple waitlist offers to popular schools, while students with no match in the main round had no hope to get an offer. This was an additional blow for students with bad application lottery numbers who had hoped to have better luck in the waitlist process. It also meant many families had wasted some of their choices on false hope.• Negative effect on diversity initiatives. Schools do not keep separate waitlists for students eligible for the low-income set-asides. The mechanics of the set-aside means that the admission lottery cutoffs for DIA-eligible students are higher than those of non-eligible students. Because the lottery numbers are not redrawn for the waitlists, there is now a perverse effect where students at the top of the list are all non-eligible. This means that schools that admit studentsfrom their waitlists are diluting the effect of their diversity initiatives and the percentage of low-income students. ",439-41,"bad original random numbers received consistently bad waitlist numbers, students with good original numbers were at the top of many waitlists. This Led to unfair situations where students with good placements in the main round were given multiple waitlist offers to popular schools, while students with no match in the main round had no hope to get an offer.",
19,FailureOfDiversityInitiatives,Causal_Theory,"To identify the cutoffs to gain admissions to various middle- and high-schools, I used a crowdsourcing survey where families were asked to enter their lottery number (only the first two characters to preserve anonymity), the school to which they matched, and the schools they ranked higher than their match. They were also asked to enter information on which priority group their students qualified for. The survey was done via Google Forms, answers were kept completely anonymous, and no identifying (or re-identifying)information was requested. The survey was approved by Rutgers Institutional Review Board. Participants were recruited through messages on social media parent groups.The survey result data was used to identify the “worst” lottery number that received an offer to the school, and the “best” that did not. The corresponding percentile in the theoretical distribution was used to get a lower and upper bound of the odds of matching to a given school. Note that these odds represent chances of matching to a given school or to a school ranked higher on the student list, as the matching algorithm will only consider a student for a school if they haven’t matched to a school they ranked higher.The full results of the surveys were published online [22], allow-ing families applying in later years to have a better idea of the odds of admissions at their preferred schools and to adjust their ranked list accordingly. For the 2021 admission season, the survey received 136 (107 with lottery numbers) answers from high-school applicants and 125 (70 with lottery numbers) answers from middle-school ap-plicants. Note that in 2021 the DOE did not provide families with their lottery number, accessing it required parents to file a FOILrequest. In 2022, the DOE started including the lottery number in the students’ admission portal, but it did so only a week before applications were due. For the 2022 admission season, the survey received 253 answers from high-school applicants and 102 answers from middle-school applicants.After a manual data cleaning step to remove obvious errors in data entry, the highest (worst) lottery number of all students who received an offer to a school was extracted: this identifies a lower bound for the school cutoff. To identify the higher bound,the process is similar but needs to consider only students who did not receive an offer to a school they ranked higher than the one to which they matched.Survey participants were asked whether they qualify for FRL(free and reduced lunch, the DOE measure of low-income status)diversity in admissions (DIA) set-asides, and whether their students had a student with disability (SWD) designation. They were given the choice to decline to answer these questions, in which case their answers were processed in the most conservative way to determine cutoffs: for instance, for a student whose FRL status is unknown,their acceptance to a school can only be used to increase the (less restrictive) DIA cutoff lower bound, while their rejection from a school can only be used to lower the (more restrictive) inDIAn cutoff upper-bound. Note that SWD are handled through a separate process, and different designations will have access to different programs. The data analysis does not differentiate among SWDstatuses.It is worth noting that families get no direct benefit from par-ticipating in the survey as information is collected after admission placements are communicated to families. Anecdotal information from parent groups’ discussions shows that participants are mo-tivated by wanting to understand the process better and helping future applicants. After the 2023 admission season, in which lottery numbers were made available to all applicants from the beginning,families requested that the survey be run again, as they had found the previous years’ results useful to create their choice lists. As of the writing of this article (May 2023), the high-school survey for the 2023 admission season has received 647 answers. The crowdsourcing survey’s goal is to gain a better understanding of the admission odds and to potentially identify issues with the process. It is not meant to be exhaustive, the recruitment of par-ticipants was done through online parent groups and mailing list and as a consequence skews toward families that speak English and are well-informed. Survey answers are not representative of the whole applicant population: respondents are clustered in some geo-graphical areas, skew higher income and higher-achieving than the DOE student population. For instance, in 2022, some high schools are using a coarse academic priority grouping to select students with a minimum GPA. All answers to the HS survey reported their student being placed in academic Group 1 for screened school ad-missions (63% of students citywide were placed in Group 1, from data received by CCHS, the Citywide Council on High Schools –selected parent body). This does not impact the correctness of thecutoff information derived from the surveys but does impact the completeness of the information. As such, the results are bound to be incomplete and to miss a large number of schools.Data, such as priority group eligibility, is self-reported by parents,and errors in data entry are possible. The data is sparse, data is missing for many schools, and it is skewed toward some schools and districts (where the survey was shared). In many cases, thecutoff could not be narrowed precisely, so the results only identified a range of lottery numbers where the cutoff falls.Table 1 reports on the statistics of the data generated by each year's survey.

Non-continuing students who do not qualify for the set-aside have little to no chance of gaining admission to the school. The survey results confirm that fewer than 6 such students received an offer.6 However, students and families are not made aware of this, so hundreds of ineligible students applied, wrote essays,and teachers spent hours grading these essays despite the students having little or no chance of receiving an offer. Hadthis information been available, students might have decided not to include the school as one of their 12 choices, and not to spend the time writing a series of school-specific essays for such low odds.As discussed in Section 2.2, a large number of students ended up not getting matched to any school on their list, especially in one Manhattan district. This was in large part due to pandemic-and diversity-driven changes in admission policy, which greatly reduced the odds of admissions to a number of schools for these students compared to previous years. (Previously, Manhattan students had geographic priority in some selected high-schools, and several high-schools selected students with high GPAs and test scores.) The DOE did not communicate well the impact of the decrease in odds tofamilies.In 2020, the DOE added waitlists to the school match following errors in the match the previous year [6, 33]. Students are automatically added to the waitlist of schools that are higher on their list than the schools to which they matched.The process that had been communicated to families during DOEZoom admission events, and noted on the DOE website stated that:“For waitlists, each applicant receives a new random number for each waitlist they are on.”It would be unfair for students with “bad"" lottery numbers to be penalized twice. The fairest way to handle the waitlists would be to reverse lottery numbers, but redrawing them is a reasonably fair alternative [13]. Students are given the opportunity to add themselves to wait lists of schools they did not list in the main round, but they will have lower priority than students who had listed the schools originally. This unfortunately creates new strategic incentives: a student with a bad main round lottery number may be lucky in the waitlist round and receive a good lottery number at a high-demand school that they wish to attend, but to have a realistic chance of being admitted from the waitlist, they have to list the school in the main round (otherwise their waitlist position will be after all students who have listed the school). Optimizing for waitlists is risky as it requires allocating one (or more) of the 12 choices in the main round for a potential shot at a good waitlist outcome. This will mechanically increase the chances of being unmatched for students who do not have a guaranteed placement. It also requires families to apply complex game theory reasoning to their school application decisions, and evaluate the tradeoffs between the risk of being unmatched and the opportunity for an additional chance in the lottery for their most preferred school(s). Finally, there is very little information as to the odds of admissions from waitlists; many schools seldom admit any students from their waitlists, and others made extensive use of them. However, there is no transparency on the number of students who were admitted from waitlists. Despite the published policy of redrawing lottery numbers, in July 2022 the DOE confirmed what many parents have suspected based on comparing their waitlist numbers: the lottery numbers had not been redrawn for a subset of schools. The reasons for this change in policy were not given. It is possible it was due to some implementation oversight. This change in published policy has two major drawbacks.• Unfairness. Students with bad original random numbers received consistently bad waitlist numbers, students with good original numbers were at the top of many waitlists. This Led to unfair situations where students with good placements in the main round were given multiple waitlist offers to popular schools, while students with no match in the main round had no hope to get an offer. This was an additional blow for students with bad application lottery numbers who had hoped to have better luck in the waitlist process. It also meant many families had wasted some of their choices on false hope.• Negative effect on diversity initiatives. Schools do not keep separate waitlists for students eligible for the low-income set-asides. The mechanics of the set-aside means that the admission lottery cutoffs for DIA-eligible students are higher than those of non-eligible students. Because the lottery numbers are not redrawn for the waitlists, there is now a perverse effect where students at the top of the list are all non-eligible. This means that schools that admit studentsfrom their waitlists are diluting the effect of their diversity initiatives and the percentage of low-income students.

The corresponding percentile in the theoretical distribution was used to get a lower and upper bound of the odds of matching to a given school.",
21,ImpactOnAdmissions,Causal_Theory,"To identify the cutoffs to gain admissions to various middle- and high-schools, I used a crowdsourcing survey where families were asked to enter their lottery number (only the first two characters to preserve anonymity), the school to which they matched, and the schools they ranked higher than their match. They were also asked to enter information on which priority group their students qualified for. The survey was done via Google Forms, answers were kept completely anonymous, and no identifying (or re-identifying)information was requested. The survey was approved by Rutgers Institutional Review Board. Participants were recruited through messages on social media parent groups.The survey result data was used to identify the “worst” lottery number that received an offer to the school, and the “best” that did not. The corresponding percentile in the theoretical distribution was used to get a lower and upper bound of the odds of matching to a given school. Note that these odds represent chances of matching to a given school or to a school ranked higher on the student list, as the matching algorithm will only consider a student for a school if they haven’t matched to a school they ranked higher.The full results of the surveys were published online [22], allow-ing families applying in later years to have a better idea of the odds of admissions at their preferred schools and to adjust their ranked list accordingly. For the 2021 admission season, the survey received 136 (107 with lottery numbers) answers from high-school applicants and 125 (70 with lottery numbers) answers from middle-school ap-plicants. Note that in 2021 the DOE did not provide families with their lottery number, accessing it required parents to file a FOILrequest. In 2022, the DOE started including the lottery number in the students’ admission portal, but it did so only a week before applications were due. For the 2022 admission season, the survey received 253 answers from high-school applicants and 102 answers from middle-school applicants.After a manual data cleaning step to remove obvious errors in data entry, the highest (worst) lottery number of all students who received an offer to a school was extracted: this identifies a lower bound for the school cutoff. To identify the higher bound,the process is similar but needs to consider only students who did not receive an offer to a school they ranked higher than the one to which they matched.Survey participants were asked whether they qualify for FRL(free and reduced lunch, the DOE measure of low-income status)diversity in admissions (DIA) set-asides, and whether their students had a student with disability (SWD) designation. They were given the choice to decline to answer these questions, in which case their answers were processed in the most conservative way to determine cutoffs: for instance, for a student whose FRL status is unknown,their acceptance to a school can only be used to increase the (less restrictive) DIA cutoff lower bound, while their rejection from a school can only be used to lower the (more restrictive) inDIAn cutoff upper-bound. Note that SWD are handled through a separate process, and different designations will have access to different programs. The data analysis does not differentiate among SWDstatuses.It is worth noting that families get no direct benefit from par-ticipating in the survey as information is collected after admission placements are communicated to families. Anecdotal information from parent groups’ discussions shows that participants are mo-tivated by wanting to understand the process better and helping future applicants. After the 2023 admission season, in which lottery numbers were made available to all applicants from the beginning,families requested that the survey be run again, as they had found the previous years’ results useful to create their choice lists. As of the writing of this article (May 2023), the high-school survey for the 2023 admission season has received 647 answers. The crowdsourcing survey’s goal is to gain a better understanding of the admission odds and to potentially identify issues with the process. It is not meant to be exhaustive, the recruitment of par-ticipants was done through online parent groups and mailing list and as a consequence skews toward families that speak English and are well-informed. Survey answers are not representative of the whole applicant population: respondents are clustered in some geo-graphical areas, skew higher income and higher-achieving than the DOE student population. For instance, in 2022, some high schools are using a coarse academic priority grouping to select students with a minimum GPA. All answers to the HS survey reported their student being placed in academic Group 1 for screened school ad-missions (63% of students citywide were placed in Group 1, from data received by CCHS, the Citywide Council on High Schools –selected parent body). This does not impact the correctness of thecutoff information derived from the surveys but does impact the completeness of the information. As such, the results are bound to be incomplete and to miss a large number of schools.Data, such as priority group eligibility, is self-reported by parents,and errors in data entry are possible. The data is sparse, data is missing for many schools, and it is skewed toward some schools and districts (where the survey was shared). In many cases, thecutoff could not be narrowed precisely, so the results only identified a range of lottery numbers where the cutoff falls.Table 1 reports on the statistics of the data generated by each year's survey. The overall school systems statistics are given in the last column but only include data from 2021 and 2022 [11] as the2023 data was not available as of the writing of this article. As noted above, the demographics of survey participants is skewed towards higher-income students and students who do not have disabilities, although the representation of these two categories improved from year to year. Approximately 436 high schools participate in the match (the exact number is not clear as some schools are often added or removed at the last minute; the count was generated from the most recent (2021) High School Directory data [24]. Some Schools have several programs to which students can apply, the survey results differentiate among these programs [22]. The survey data contains information from about a quarter of the schools.4.An interesting data point from Table 1 is the percentage of un-matched students in the dataset. In 2021 and 2022, 7% of students citywide were unmatched. The rate of unmatched survey partici-pants for 2022 is close to the actual citywide rate, but the rate of unmatched survey students for 2021 is much higher. This is likely due to a few reasons:(1) In 2021, families had to FOIL their lottery number to gain access to it. Those who did go through the process were likely to be the ones who were upset at their outcomes and were motivated to understand what happened. In later years,all applicants could see their lottery numbers in the applicant portal.(2) Survey respondents from 2021 were typically from higher-income districts where the rate of unmatched students was 4 It is possible that the proportion of schools to which the survey participants applied is higher, however, we only count schools for which they were considered, i.e., either the school to which they matched, or the schools that they ranked higher than their match higher than the city average (18% in District 2, 12% in District3, 9% in District 15 [11]).5The unmatched rate for the 2023 survey is much lower. Unfortu-nately, the actual unmatched rate is not available as of the writing of this article (May 2023). It is unclear whether the citywide un-matched rate declined, or if survey participants, a self-selected group, most of whom had access to past survey results and were able to tailor their choice list based on their lottery number and past cutoff information, modified their behavior in a way that minimizes their odds of being unmatched. More analysis on possible changes in behavior due to having access to lottery numbers is needed (seeSection 6) Full results and analysis were shared online [22], and made available to NYC families to plan their application. As the details of the odds of admissions at specific schools are not directly relevant to the reader, I will only highlight the main lessons learned from the analysis in this section.• The lottery number had an outsized impact on admissions, including admissions to “screened” schools that considered essays and auditions in their admission process. Several schools used both assessments and grades.Students were ranked on a composite score based on their school-specific assessments (typically essays), and grades. Many students with bad lottery numbers saw these schools as their best hope to get a desirable match, as they could compensate for bad luck in the lottery draw with a strong essay. The results show that essays were graded coarsely, or not at all, and the lottery number was used to break ties, being a major factor in admission for these schools. For instance, to gain admission to Beacon High School, one of the most popular high schools, students needed a perfect 400 assessment score AND a lottery number that started with 6' or lower (a 400 score with a ‘6f’ lottery number was not given an offer). Another school, Manhattan / Hunter Science High School assigned the maximum essay score of 400 to all students who submitted the essay, resulting in students needing a good lottery number (starting with ‘3’ or lower) to gain admission.• The process results in a large amount of wasted time and resources, both on the students’ side and the schoolside. The above results highlight how wasteful in terms of time and resources the process is. Because of the coarseness of the grading, students with no chance of gaining admission to either school because of their bad lottery numbers spent time writing essays and used precious choices on their list for the schools. Meanwhile, teachers spent time grading these essays (at least at Beacon High School), despite the grades not having any impact of these students’ admission chances.• Students are applying to schools for which they are no seats for their priority group. Consider the example of the New Explorations into Science, Technology and Math HighSchool (NEST+m) school, a popular school with thousands of applicants. NEST+m is a K-12 school with priority given to continuing students and a 66% DIA set-aside for low-income students. Historically 53% of offers are given to continu-ing students. However, the demographic data of continuing students shows few students qualifying for the low-income set-aside. Once continuing students, in the top priority group,are given offers, the only remaining seats left are reserved for students who qualify for the set-aside. Non-continuing students who do not qualify for the set-aside have little to no chance of gaining admission to the school. The survey results confirm that fewer than 6 such students received an offer.6 However, students and families are not made aware of this, so hundreds of ineligible students applied, wrote essays,and teachers spent hours grading these essays despite the students having little or no chance of receiving an offer.

The survey was approved by Rutgers Institutional Review Board. Participants were recruited through messages on social media parent groups.The survey result data was used to identify the “worst” lottery number that received an offer to the school, and the “best” that did not. The corresponding percentile in the theoretical distribution was used to get a lower and upper bound of the odds of matching to a given school. Note that these odds represent chances of matching to a given school or to a school ranked higher on the student list, as the matching algorithm will only consider a student for a school if they haven’t matched to a school they ranked higher.The full results of the surveys were published online [22], allow-ing families applying in later years to have a better idea of the odds of admissions at their preferred schools and to adjust their ranked list accordingly. For the 2021 admission season, the survey received 136 (107 with lottery numbers) answers from high-school applicants and 125 (70 with lottery numbers) answers from middle-school ap-plicants. Note that in 2021 the DOE did not provide families with their lottery number, accessing it required parents to file a FOILrequest. In 2022, the DOE started including the lottery number in the students’ admission portal, but it did so only a week before applications were due. For the 2022 admission season, the survey received 253 answers from high-school applicants and 102 answers from middle-school applicants.After a manual data cleaning step to remove obvious errors in data entry, the highest (worst) lottery number of all students who received an offer to a school was extracted: this identifies a lower bound for the school cutoff. To identify the higher bound,the process is similar but needs to consider only students who did not receive an offer to a school they ranked higher than the one to which they matched.Survey participants were asked whether they qualify for FRL(free and reduced lunch, the DOE measure of low-income status)diversity in admissions (DIA) set-asides, and whether their students had a student with disability (SWD) designation. They were given the choice to decline to answer these questions, in which case their answers were processed in the most conservative way to determine cutoffs: for instance, for a student whose FRL status is unknown,their acceptance to a school can only be used to increase the (less restrictive) DIA cutoff lower bound, while their rejection from a school can only be used to lower the (more restrictive) inDIAn cutoff upper-bound. Note that SWD are handled through a separate process, and different designations will have access to different programs. The data analysis does not differentiate among SWDstatuses.It is worth noting that families get no direct benefit from par-ticipating in the survey as information is collected after admission placements are communicated to families. Anecdotal information from parent groups’ discussions shows that participants are mo-tivated by wanting to understand the process better and helping future applicants. After the 2023 admission season, in which lottery numbers were made available to all applicants from the beginning,families requested that the survey be run again, as they had found the previous years’ results useful to create their choice lists. As of the writing of this article (May 2023), the high-school survey for the 2023 admission season has received 647 answers. The crowdsourcing survey’s goal is to gain a better understanding of the admission odds and to potentially identify issues with the process. It is not meant to be exhaustive, the recruitment of par-ticipants was done through online parent groups and mailing list and as a consequence skews toward families that speak English and are well-informed. Survey answers are not representative of the whole applicant population: respondents are clustered in some geo-graphical areas, skew higher income and higher-achieving than the DOE student population. For instance, in 2022, some high schools are using a coarse academic priority grouping to select students with a minimum GPA. All answers to the HS survey reported their student being placed in academic Group 1 for screened school ad-missions (63% of students citywide were placed in Group 1, from data received by CCHS, the Citywide Council on High Schools –selected parent body). This does not impact the correctness of thecutoff information derived from the surveys but does impact the completeness of the information. As such, the results are bound to be incomplete and to miss a large number of schools.Data, such as priority group eligibility, is self-reported by parents,and errors in data entry are possible. The data is sparse, data is missing for many schools, and it is skewed toward some schools and districts (where the survey was shared). In many cases, thecutoff could not be narrowed precisely, so the results only identified a range of lottery numbers where the cutoff falls.Table 1 reports on the statistics of the data generated by each year's survey. The overall school systems statistics are given in the last column but only include data from 2021 and 2022 [11] as the2023 data was not available as of the writing of this article. As noted above, the demographics of survey participants is skewed towards higher-income students and students who do not have disabilities, although the representation of these two categories improved from year to year. Approximately 436 high schools participate in the match (the exact number is not clear as some schools are often added or removed at the last minute; the count was generated from the most recent (2021) High School Directory data [24]. Some Schools have several programs to which students can apply, the survey results differentiate among these programs [22]. The survey data contains information from about a quarter of the schools.4.An interesting data point from Table 1 is the percentage of un-matched students in the dataset. In 2021 and 2022, 7% of students citywide were unmatched. The rate of unmatched survey partici-pants for 2022 is close to the actual citywide rate, but the rate of unmatched survey students for 2021 is much higher. This is likely due to a few reasons:(1) In 2021, families had to FOIL their lottery number to gain access to it. Those who did go through the process were likely to be the ones who were upset at their outcomes and were motivated to understand what happened. In later years,all applicants could see their lottery numbers in the applicant portal.(2) Survey respondents from 2021 were typically from higher-income districts where the rate of unmatched students was 4 It is possible that the proportion of schools to which the survey participants applied is higher, however, we only count schools for which they were considered, i.e., either the school to which they matched, or the schools that they ranked higher than their match higher than the city average (18% in District 2, 12% in District3, 9% in District 15 [11]).5The unmatched rate for the 2023 survey is much lower. Unfortu-nately, the actual unmatched rate is not available as of the writing of this article (May 2023). It is unclear whether the citywide un-matched rate declined, or if survey participants, a self-selected group, most of whom had access to past survey results and were able to tailor their choice list based on their lottery number and past cutoff information, modified their behavior in a way that minimizes their odds of being unmatched. More analysis on possible changes in behavior due to having access to lottery numbers is needed (seeSection 6) Full results and analysis were shared online [22], and made available to NYC families to plan their application. As the details of the odds of admissions at specific schools are not directly relevant to the reader, I will only highlight the main lessons learned from the analysis in this section.• The lottery number had an outsized impact on admissions, including admissions to “screened” schools that considered essays and auditions in their admission process. Several schools used both assessments and grades.Students were ranked on a composite score based on their school-specific assessments (typically essays), and grades. Many students with bad lottery numbers saw these schools as their best hope to get a desirable match, as they could compensate for bad luck in the lottery draw with a strong essay. The results show that essays were graded coarsely, or not at all, and the lottery number was used to break ties, being a major factor in admission for these schools. For instance, to gain admission to Beacon High School, one of the most popular high schools, students needed a perfect 400 assessment score AND a lottery number that started with 6' or lower (a 400 score with a ‘6f’ lottery number was not given an offer). Another school, Manhattan / Hunter Science High School assigned the maximum essay score of 400 to all students who submitted the essay, resulting in students needing a good lottery number (starting with ‘3’ or lower) to gain admission.• The process results in a large amount of wasted time and resources, both on the students’ side and the schoolside. The above results highlight how wasteful in terms of time and resources the process is. Because of the coarseness of the grading, students with no chance of gaining admission to either school because of their bad lottery numbers spent time writing essays and used precious choices on their list for the schools. Meanwhile, teachers spent time grading these essays (at least at Beacon High School), despite the grades not having any impact of these students’ admission chances.• Students are applying to schools for which they are no seats for their priority group. Consider the example of the New Explorations into Science, Technology and Math HighSchool (NEST+m) school, a popular school with thousands of applicants. NEST+m is a K-12 school with priority given to continuing students and a 66% DIA set-aside for low-income students. Historically 53% of offers are given to continu-ing students. However, the demographic data of continuing students shows few students qualifying for the low-income set-aside. Once continuing students, in the top priority group,are given offers, the only remaining seats left are reserved for students who qualify for the set-aside. Non-continuing students who do not qualify for the set-aside have little to no chance of gaining admission to the school. The survey results confirm that fewer than 6 such students received an offer.6 However, students and families are not made aware of this, so hundreds of ineligible students applied, wrote essays,and teachers spent hours grading these essays despite the students having little or no chance of receiving an offer. Hadthis information been available, students might have decided not to include the school as one of their 12 choices, and not to spend the time writing a series of school-specific essays for such low odds.As discussed in Section 2.2, a large number of students ended up not getting matched to any school on their list, especially in one Manhattan district. This was in large part due to pandemic-and diversity-driven changes in admission policy, which greatly reduced the odds of admissions to a number of schools for these students compared to previous years. (Previously, Manhattan students had geographic priority in some selected high-schools, and several high-schools selected students with high GPAs and test scores.) The DOE did not communicate well the impact of the decrease in odds tofamilies.In 2020, the DOE added waitlists to the school match following errors in the match the previous year [6, 33]. Students are automatically added to the waitlist of schools that are higher on their list than the schools to which they matched.The process that had been communicated to families during DOEZoom admission events, and noted on the DOE website stated that:“For waitlists, each applicant receives a new random number for each waitlist they are on.”It would be unfair for students with “bad"" lottery numbers to be penalized twice. The fairest way to handle the waitlists would be to reverse lottery numbers, but redrawing them is a reasonably fair alternative [13]. Students are given the opportunity to add themselves to wait lists of schools they did not list in the main round, but they will have lower priority than students who had listed the schools originally. This unfortunately creates new strategic incentives: a student with a bad main round lottery number may be lucky in the waitlist round and receive a good lottery number at a high-demand school that they wish to attend, but to have a realistic chance of being admitted from the waitlist, they have to list the school in the main round (otherwise their waitlist position will be after all students who have listed the school). Optimizing for waitlists is risky as it requires allocating one (or more) of the 12 choices in the main round for a potential shot at a good waitlist outcome. This will mechanically increase the chances of being unmatched for students who do not have a guaranteed placement. It also requires families to apply complex game theory reasoning to their school application decisions, and evaluate the tradeoffs between the risk of being unmatched and the opportunity for an additional chance in the lottery for their most preferred school(s). Finally, there is very little information as to the odds of admissions from waitlists; many schools seldom admit any students from their waitlists, and others made extensive use of them. However, there is no transparency on the number of students who were admitted from waitlists. Despite the published policy of redrawing lottery numbers, in July 2022 the DOE confirmed what many parents have suspected based on comparing their waitlist numbers: the lottery numbers had not been redrawn for a subset of schools. The reasons for this change in policy were not given. It is possible it was due to some implementation oversight. This change in published policy has two major drawbacks.• Unfairness. Students with bad original random numbers received consistently bad waitlist numbers, students with good original numbers were at the top of many waitlists. This Led to unfair situations where students with good placements in the main round were given multiple waitlist offers to popular schools, while students with no match in the main round had no hope to get an offer. This was an additional blow for students with bad application lottery numbers who had hoped to have better luck in the waitlist process. It also meant many families had wasted some of their choices on false hope.• Negative effect on diversity initiatives. Schools do not keep separate waitlists for students eligible for the low-income set-asides. The mechanics of the set-aside means that the admission lottery cutoffs for DIA-eligible students are higher than those of non-eligible students. Because the lottery numbers are not redrawn for the waitlists, there is now a perverse effect where students at the top of the list are all non-eligible. This means that schools that admit studentsfrom their waitlists are diluting the effect of their diversity initiatives and the percentage of low-income students. ",439-41,The DOE,
24,Students,Agent,"To identify the cutoffs to gain admissions to various middle- and high-schools, I used a crowdsourcing survey where families were asked to enter their lottery number (only the first two characters to preserve anonymity), the school to which they matched, and the schools they ranked higher than their match.

In 2021 and 2022, 7% of students citywide were unmatched. The rate of unmatched survey partici-pants for 2022 is close to the actual citywide rate, but the rate of unmatched survey students for 2021 is much higher. This is likely due to a few reasons:(1) In 2021, families had to FOIL their lottery number to gain access to it. Those who did go through the process were likely to be the ones who were upset at their outcomes and were motivated to understand what happened. In later years,all applicants could see their lottery numbers in the applicant portal.(2) Survey respondents from 2021 were typically from higher-income districts where the rate of unmatched students was 4 It is possible that the proportion of schools to which the survey participants applied is higher, however, we only count schools for which they were considered, i.e., either the school to which they matched, or the schools that they ranked higher than their match higher than the city average (18% in District 2, 12% in District3, 9% in District 15 [11]).5The unmatched rate for the 2023 survey is much lower. Unfortu-nately, the actual unmatched rate is not available as of the writing of this article (May 2023). It is unclear whether the citywide un-matched rate declined, or if survey participants, a self-selected group, most of whom had access to past survey results and were able to tailor their choice list based on their lottery number and past cutoff information, modified their behavior in a way that minimizes their odds of being unmatched. More analysis on possible changes in behavior due to having access to lottery numbers is needed (seeSection 6) Full results and analysis were shared online [22], and made available to NYC families to plan their application. As the details of the odds of admissions at specific schools are not directly relevant to the reader, I will only highlight the main lessons learned from the analysis in this section.• The lottery number had an outsized impact on admissions, including admissions to “screened” schools that considered essays and auditions in their admission process. Several schools used both assessments and grades.Students were ranked on a composite score based on their school-specific assessments (typically essays), and grades. Many students with bad lottery numbers saw these schools as their best hope to get a desirable match, as they could compensate for bad luck in the lottery draw with a strong essay. The results show that essays were graded coarsely, or not at all, and the lottery number was used to break ties, being a major factor in admission for these schools. For instance, to gain admission to Beacon High School, one of the most popular high schools, students needed a perfect 400 assessment score AND a lottery number that started with 6' or lower (a 400 score with a ‘6f’ lottery number was not given an offer). Another school, Manhattan / Hunter Science High School assigned the maximum essay score of 400 to all students who submitted the essay, resulting in students needing a good lottery number (starting with ‘3’ or lower) to gain admission.• The process results in a large amount of wasted time and resources, both on the students’ side and the schoolside. The above results highlight how wasteful in terms of time and resources the process is. Because of the coarseness of the grading, students with no chance of gaining admission to either school because of their bad lottery numbers spent time writing essays and used precious choices on their list for the schools. Meanwhile, teachers spent time grading these essays (at least at Beacon High School), despite the grades not having any impact of these students’ admission chances.• Students are applying to schools for which they are no seats for their priority group. Consider the example of the New Explorations into Science, Technology and Math HighSchool (NEST+m) school, a popular school with thousands of applicants. NEST+m is a K-12 school with priority given to continuing students and a 66% DIA set-aside for low-income students. Historically 53% of offers are given to continu-ing students. However, the demographic data of continuing students shows few students qualifying for the low-income set-aside. Once continuing students, in the top priority group,are given offers, the only remaining seats left are reserved for students who qualify for the set-aside. Non-continuing students who do not qualify for the set-aside have little to no chance of gaining admission to the school. The survey results confirm that fewer than 6 such students received an offer.6 However, students and families are not made aware of this, so hundreds of ineligible students applied, wrote essays,and teachers spent hours grading these essays despite the students having little or no chance of receiving an offer. Hadthis information been available, students might have decided not to include the school as one of their 12 choices, and not to spend the time writing a series of school-specific essays for such low odds.As discussed in Section 2.2, a large number of students ended up not getting matched to any school on their list, especially in one Manhattan district. This was in large part due to pandemic-and diversity-driven changes in admission policy, which greatly reduced the odds of admissions to a number of schools for these students compared to previous years. (Previously, Manhattan students had geographic priority in some selected high-schools, and several high-schools selected students with high GPAs and test scores.) The DOE did not communicate well the impact of the decrease in odds tofamilies.In 2020, the DOE added waitlists to the school match following errors in the match the previous year [6, 33]. Students are automatically added to the waitlist of schools that are higher on their list than the schools to which they matched.The process that had been communicated to families during DOEZoom admission events, and noted on the DOE website stated that:“For waitlists, each applicant receives a new random number for each waitlist they are on.”It would be unfair for students with “bad"" lottery numbers to be penalized twice. The fairest way to handle the waitlists would be to reverse lottery numbers, but redrawing them is a reasonably fair alternative [13]. Students are given the opportunity to add themselves to wait lists of schools they did not list in the main round, but they will have lower priority than students who had listed the schools originally. This unfortunately creates new strategic incentives: a student with a bad main round lottery number may be lucky in the waitlist round and receive a good lottery number at a high-demand school that they wish to attend, but to have a realistic chance of being admitted from the waitlist, they have to list the school in the main round (otherwise their waitlist position will be after all students who have listed the school). Optimizing for waitlists is risky as it requires allocating one (or more) of the 12 choices in the main round for a potential shot at a good waitlist outcome. This will mechanically increase the chances of being unmatched for students who do not have a guaranteed placement. It also requires families to apply complex game theory reasoning to their school application decisions, and evaluate the tradeoffs between the risk of being unmatched and the opportunity for an additional chance in the lottery for their most preferred school(s). Finally, there is very little information as to the odds of admissions from waitlists; many schools seldom admit any students from their waitlists, and others made extensive use of them. However, there is no transparency on the number of students who were admitted from waitlists. Despite the published policy of redrawing lottery numbers, in July 2022 the DOE confirmed what many parents have suspected based on comparing their waitlist numbers: the lottery numbers had not been redrawn for a subset of schools. The reasons for this change in policy were not given. It is possible it was due to some implementation oversight. This change in published policy has two major drawbacks.• Unfairness. Students with bad original random numbers received consistently bad waitlist numbers, students with good original numbers were at the top of many waitlists. This Led to unfair situations where students with good placements in the main round were given multiple waitlist offers to popular schools, while students with no match in the main round had no hope to get an offer. This was an additional blow for students with bad application lottery numbers who had hoped to have better luck in the waitlist process. It also meant many families had wasted some of their choices on false hope.• Negative effect on diversity initiatives. Schools do not keep separate waitlists for students eligible for the low-income set-asides. The mechanics of the set-aside means that the admission lottery cutoffs for DIA-eligible students are higher than those of non-eligible students. Because the lottery numbers are not redrawn for the waitlists, there is now a perverse effect where students at the top of the list are all non-eligible. This means that schools that admit studentsfrom their waitlists are diluting the effect of their diversity initiatives and the percentage of low-income students. ",439-41,schools,

32,Families,hasProducedArtifact,SchoolMatchInformation,"To identify the cutoffs to gain admissions to various middle- and high-schools, I used a crowdsourcing survey where families were asked to enter their lottery number (only the first two characters to preserve anonymity), the school to which they matched, and the schools they ranked higher than their match. They were also asked to enter information on which priority group their students qualified for. The survey was done via Google Forms, answers were kept completely anonymous, and no identifying (or re-identifying)information was requested. The survey was approved by Rutgers Institutional Review Board. Participants were recruited through messages on social media parent groups.The survey result data was used to identify the “worst” lottery number that received an offer to the school, and the “best” that did not. The corresponding percentile in the theoretical distribution was used to get a lower and upper bound of the odds of matching to a given school. Note that these odds represent chances of matching to a given school or to a school ranked higher on the student list, as the matching algorithm will only consider a student for a school if they haven’t matched to a school they ranked higher.The full results of the surveys were published online [22], allow-ing families applying in later years to have a better idea of the odds of admissions at their preferred schools and to adjust their ranked list accordingly. For the 2021 admission season, the survey received 136 (107 with lottery numbers) answers from high-school applicants and 125 (70 with lottery numbers) answers from middle-school ap-plicants. Note that in 2021 the DOE did not provide families with their lottery number, accessing it required parents to file a FOILrequest. In 2022, the DOE started including the lottery number in the students’ admission portal, but it did so only a week before applications were due. For the 2022 admission season, the survey received 253 answers from high-school applicants and 102 answers from middle-school applicants.After a manual data cleaning step to remove obvious errors in data entry, the highest (worst) lottery number of all students who received an offer to a school was extracted: this identifies a lower bound for the school cutoff. To identify the higher bound,the process is similar but needs to consider only students who did not receive an offer to a school they ranked higher than the one to which they matched.Survey participants were asked whether they qualify for FRL(free and reduced lunch, the DOE measure of low-income status)diversity in admissions (DIA) set-asides, and whether their students had a student with disability (SWD) designation. They were given the choice to decline to answer these questions, in which case their answers were processed in the most conservative way to determine cutoffs: for instance, for a student whose FRL status is unknown,their acceptance to a school can only be used to increase the (less restrictive) DIA cutoff lower bound, while their rejection from a school can only be used to lower the (more restrictive) inDIAn cutoff upper-bound. Note that SWD are handled through a separate process, and different designations will have access to different programs. The data analysis does not differentiate among SWDstatuses.It is worth noting that families get no direct benefit from par-ticipating in the survey as information is collected after admission placements are communicated to families. Anecdotal information from parent groups’ discussions shows that participants are mo-tivated by wanting to understand the process better and helping future applicants. After the 2023 admission season, in which lottery numbers were made available to all applicants from the beginning,families requested that the survey be run again, as they had found the previous years’ results useful to create their choice lists. As of the writing of this article (May 2023), the high-school survey for the 2023 admission season has received 647 answers. The crowdsourcing survey’s goal is to gain a better understanding of the admission odds and to potentially identify issues with the process. It is not meant to be exhaustive, the recruitment of par-ticipants was done through online parent groups and mailing list and as a consequence skews toward families that speak English and are well-informed. Survey answers are not representative of the whole applicant population: respondents are clustered in some geo-graphical areas, skew higher income and higher-achieving than the DOE student population. For instance, in 2022, some high schools are using a coarse academic priority grouping to select students with a minimum GPA. All answers to the HS survey reported their student being placed in academic Group 1 for screened school ad-missions (63% of students citywide were placed in Group 1, from data received by CCHS, the Citywide Council on High Schools –selected parent body). This does not impact the correctness of thecutoff information derived from the surveys but does impact the completeness of the information. As such, the results are bound to be incomplete and to miss a large number of schools.Data, such as priority group eligibility, is self-reported by parents,and errors in data entry are possible. The data is sparse, data is missing for many schools, and it is skewed toward some schools and districts (where the survey was shared). In many cases, thecutoff could not be narrowed precisely, so the results only identified a range of lottery numbers where the cutoff falls.Table 1 reports on the statistics of the data generated by each year's survey. The overall school systems statistics are given in the last column but only include data from 2021 and 2022 [11] as the2023 data was not available as of the writing of this article. As noted above, the demographics of survey participants is skewed towards higher-income students and students who do not have disabilities, although the representation of these two categories improved from year to year. Approximately 436 high schools participate in the match (the exact number is not clear as some schools are often added or removed at the last minute; the count was generated from the most recent (2021) High School Directory data [24]. Some Schools have several programs to which students can apply, the survey results differentiate among these programs [22].

This was in large part due to pandemic-and diversity-driven changes in admission policy, which greatly reduced the odds of admissions to a number of schools for these students compared to previous years. (Previously, Manhattan students had geographic priority in some selected high-schools, and several high-schools selected students with high GPAs and test scores.) The DOE did not communicate well the impact of the decrease in odds tofamilies.In 2020, the DOE added waitlists to the school match following errors in the match the previous year [6, 33]. Students are automatically added to the waitlist of schools that are higher on their list than the schools to which they matched.The process that had been communicated to families during DOEZoom admission events, and noted on the DOE website stated that:“For waitlists, each applicant receives a new random number for each waitlist they are on.”It would be unfair for students with “bad"" lottery numbers to be penalized twice. The fairest way to handle the waitlists would be to reverse lottery numbers, but redrawing them is a reasonably fair alternative [13]. Students are given the opportunity to add themselves to wait lists of schools they did not list in the main round, but they will have lower priority than students who had listed the schools originally. This unfortunately creates new strategic incentives: a student with a bad main round lottery number may be lucky in the waitlist round and receive a good lottery number at a high-demand school that they wish to attend, but to have a realistic chance of being admitted from the waitlist, they have to list the school in the main round (otherwise their waitlist position will be after all students who have listed the school). Optimizing for waitlists is risky as it requires allocating one (or more) of the 12 choices in the main round for a potential shot at a good waitlist outcome. This will mechanically increase the chances of being unmatched for students who do not have a guaranteed placement. It also requires families to apply complex game theory reasoning to their school application decisions, and evaluate the tradeoffs between the risk of being unmatched and the opportunity for an additional chance in the lottery for their most preferred school(s). Finally, there is very little information as to the odds of admissions from waitlists; many schools seldom admit any students from their waitlists, and others made extensive use of them. However, there is no transparency on the number of students who were admitted from waitlists. Despite the published policy of redrawing lottery numbers, in July 2022 the DOE confirmed what many parents have suspected based on comparing their waitlist numbers: the lottery numbers had not been redrawn for a subset of schools. The reasons for this change in policy were not given. It is possible it was due to some implementation oversight. This change in published policy has two major drawbacks.• Unfairness. Students with bad original random numbers received consistently bad waitlist numbers, students with good original numbers were at the top of many waitlists. This Led to unfair situations where students with good placements in the main round were given multiple waitlist offers to popular schools, while students with no match in the main round had no hope to get an offer. This was an additional blow for students with bad application lottery numbers who had hoped to have better luck in the waitlist process. It also meant many families had wasted some of their choices on false hope.• Negative effect on diversity initiatives. Schools do not keep separate waitlists for students eligible for the low-income set-asides. The mechanics of the set-aside means that the admission lottery cutoffs for DIA-eligible students are higher than those of non-eligible students. Because the lottery numbers are not redrawn for the waitlists, there is now a perverse effect where students at the top of the list are all non-eligible. This means that schools that admit studentsfrom their waitlists are diluting the effect of their diversity initiatives and the percentage of low-income students. ",439-41,"The survey result data was used to identify the “worst” lottery number that received an offer to the school, and the “best” that did not. The corresponding percentile in the theoretical distribution was used to get a lower and upper bound of the odds of matching to a given school."
34,DesireForUnderstanding,constrainsAgent,Families,"To identify the cutoffs to gain admissions to various middle- and high-schools, I used a crowdsourcing survey where families were asked to enter their lottery number (only the first two characters to preserve anonymity), the school to which they matched, and the schools they ranked higher than their match. They were also asked to enter information on which priority group their students qualified for. The survey was done via Google Forms, answers were kept completely anonymous, and no identifying (or re-identifying)information was requested. The survey was approved by Rutgers Institutional Review Board. Participants were recruited through messages on social media parent groups.The survey result data was used to identify the “worst” lottery number that received an offer to the school, and the “best” that did not. The corresponding percentile in the theoretical distribution was used to get a lower and upper bound of the odds of matching to a given school. Note that these odds represent chances of matching to a given school or to a school ranked higher on the student list, as the matching algorithm will only consider a student for a school if they haven’t matched to a school they ranked higher.The full results of the surveys were published online [22], allow-ing families applying in later years to have a better idea of the odds of admissions at their preferred schools and to adjust their ranked list accordingly. For the 2021 admission season, the survey received 136 (107 with lottery numbers) answers from high-school applicants and 125 (70 with lottery numbers) answers from middle-school ap-plicants. Note that in 2021 the DOE did not provide families with their lottery number, accessing it required parents to file a FOILrequest. In 2022, the DOE started including the lottery number in the students’ admission portal, but it did so only a week before applications were due. For the 2022 admission season, the survey received 253 answers from high-school applicants and 102 answers from middle-school applicants.After a manual data cleaning step to remove obvious errors in data entry, the highest (worst) lottery number of all students who received an offer to a school was extracted: this identifies a lower bound for the school cutoff. To identify the higher bound,the process is similar but needs to consider only students who did not receive an offer to a school they ranked higher than the one to which they matched.Survey participants were asked whether they qualify for FRL(free and reduced lunch, the DOE measure of low-income status)diversity in admissions (DIA) set-asides, and whether their students had a student with disability (SWD) designation. They were given the choice to decline to answer these questions, in which case their answers were processed in the most conservative way to determine cutoffs: for instance, for a student whose FRL status is unknown,their acceptance to a school can only be used to increase the (less restrictive) DIA cutoff lower bound, while their rejection from a school can only be used to lower the (more restrictive) inDIAn cutoff upper-bound. Note that SWD are handled through a separate process, and different designations will have access to different programs. The data analysis does not differentiate among SWDstatuses.It is worth noting that families get no direct benefit from par-ticipating in the survey as information is collected after admission placements are communicated to families. Anecdotal information from parent groups’ discussions shows that participants are mo-tivated by wanting to understand the process better and helping future applicants. After the 2023 admission season, in which lottery numbers were made available to all applicants from the beginning,families requested that the survey be run again, as they had found the previous years’ results useful to create their choice lists. As of the writing of this article (May 2023), the high-school survey for the 2023 admission season has received 647 answers. The crowdsourcing survey’s goal is to gain a better understanding of the admission odds and to potentially identify issues with the process. It is not meant to be exhaustive, the recruitment of par-ticipants was done through online parent groups and mailing list and as a consequence skews toward families that speak English and are well-informed. Survey answers are not representative of the whole applicant population: respondents are clustered in some geo-graphical areas, skew higher income and higher-achieving than the DOE student population. For instance, in 2022, some high schools are using a coarse academic priority grouping to select students with a minimum GPA. All answers to the HS survey reported their student being placed in academic Group 1 for screened school ad-missions (63% of students citywide were placed in Group 1, from data received by CCHS, the Citywide Council on High Schools –selected parent body). This does not impact the correctness of thecutoff information derived from the surveys but does impact the completeness of the information. As such, the results are bound to be incomplete and to miss a large number of schools.Data, such as priority group eligibility, is self-reported by parents,and errors in data entry are possible. The data is sparse, data is missing for many schools, and it is skewed toward some schools and districts (where the survey was shared). In many cases, thecutoff could not be narrowed precisely, so the results only identified a range of lottery numbers where the cutoff falls.Table 1 reports on the statistics of the data generated by each year's survey. The overall school systems statistics are given in the last column but only include data from 2021 and 2022 [11] as the2023 data was not available as of the writing of this article. As noted above, the demographics of survey participants is skewed towards higher-income students and students who do not have disabilities, although the representation of these two categories improved from year to year. Approximately 436 high schools participate in the match (the exact number is not clear as some schools are often added or removed at the last minute; the count was generated from the most recent (2021) High School Directory data [24]. Some Schools have several programs to which students can apply, the survey results differentiate among these programs [22]. The survey data contains information from about a quarter of the schools.4.An interesting data point from Table 1 is the percentage of un-matched students in the dataset. In 2021 and 2022, 7% of students citywide were unmatched. The rate of unmatched survey partici-pants for 2022 is close to the actual citywide rate, but the rate of unmatched survey students for 2021 is much higher. This is likely due to a few reasons:(1) In 2021, families had to FOIL their lottery number to gain access to it. Those who did go through the process were likely to be the ones who were upset at their outcomes and were motivated to understand what happened. In later years,all applicants could see their lottery numbers in the applicant portal.(2) Survey respondents from 2021 were typically from higher-income districts where the rate of unmatched students was 4 It is possible that the proportion of schools to which the survey participants applied is higher, however, we only count schools for which they were considered, i.e., either the school to which they matched, or the schools that they ranked higher than their match higher than the city average (18% in District 2, 12% in District3, 9% in District 15 [11]).5The unmatched rate for the 2023 survey is much lower. Unfortu-nately, the actual unmatched rate is not available as of the writing of this article (May 2023). It is unclear whether the citywide un-matched rate declined, or if survey participants, a self-selected group, most of whom had access to past survey results and were able to tailor their choice list based on their lottery number and past cutoff information, modified their behavior in a way that minimizes their odds of being unmatched. More analysis on possible changes in behavior due to having access to lottery numbers is needed (seeSection 6) Full results and analysis were shared online [22], and made available to NYC families to plan their application. As the details of the odds of admissions at specific schools are not directly relevant to the reader, I will only highlight the main lessons learned from the analysis in this section.• The lottery number had an outsized impact on admissions, including admissions to “screened” schools that considered essays and auditions in their admission process. Several schools used both assessments and grades.Students were ranked on a composite score based on their school-specific assessments (typically essays), and grades. Many students with bad lottery numbers saw these schools as their best hope to get a desirable match, as they could compensate for bad luck in the lottery draw with a strong essay. The results show that essays were graded coarsely, or not at all, and the lottery number was used to break ties, being a major factor in admission for these schools. For instance, to gain admission to Beacon High School, one of the most popular high schools, students needed a perfect 400 assessment score AND a lottery number that started with 6' or lower (a 400 score with a ‘6f’ lottery number was not given an offer). Another school, Manhattan / Hunter Science High School assigned the maximum essay score of 400 to all students who submitted the essay, resulting in students needing a good lottery number (starting with ‘3’ or lower) to gain admission.• The process results in a large amount of wasted time and resources, both on the students’ side and the schoolside. The above results highlight how wasteful in terms of time and resources the process is. Because of the coarseness of the grading, students with no chance of gaining admission to either school because of their bad lottery numbers spent time writing essays and used precious choices on their list for the schools. Meanwhile, teachers spent time grading these essays (at least at Beacon High School), despite the grades not having any impact of these students’ admission chances.• Students are applying to schools for which they are no seats for their priority group. Consider the example of the New Explorations into Science, Technology and Math HighSchool (NEST+m) school, a popular school with thousands of applicants. NEST+m is a K-12 school with priority given to continuing students and a 66% DIA set-aside for low-income students. Historically 53% of offers are given to continu-ing students. However, the demographic data of continuing students shows few students qualifying for the low-income set-aside. Once continuing students, in the top priority group,are given offers, the only remaining seats left are reserved for students who qualify for the set-aside. Non-continuing students who do not qualify for the set-aside have little to no chance of gaining admission to the school. The survey results confirm that fewer than 6 such students received an offer.6 However, students and families are not made aware of this, so hundreds of ineligible students applied, wrote essays,and teachers spent hours grading these essays despite the students having little or no chance of receiving an offer. Hadthis information been available, students might have decided not to include the school as one of their 12 choices, and not to spend the time writing a series of school-specific essays for such low odds.As discussed in Section 2.2, a large number of students ended up not getting matched to any school on their list, especially in one Manhattan district.

This means that schools that admit studentsfrom their waitlists are diluting the effect of their diversity initiatives and the percentage of low-income students.

Note that these odds represent chances of matching to a given school or to a school ranked higher on the student list, as the matching algorithm will only consider a student for a school if they haven’t matched to a school they ranked higher.The full results of the surveys were published online [22], allow-ing families applying in later years to have a better idea of the odds of admissions at their preferred schools and to adjust their ranked list accordingly. For the 2021 admission season, the survey received 136 (107 with lottery numbers) answers from high-school applicants and 125 (70 with lottery numbers) answers from middle-school ap-plicants. Note that in 2021 the DOE did not provide families with their lottery number, accessing it required parents to file a FOILrequest. In 2022, the DOE started including the lottery number in the students’ admission portal, but it did so only a week before applications were due. For the 2022 admission season, the survey received 253 answers from high-school applicants and 102 answers from middle-school applicants.After a manual data cleaning step to remove obvious errors in data entry, the highest (worst) lottery number of all students who received an offer to a school was extracted: this identifies a lower bound for the school cutoff. To identify the higher bound,the process is similar but needs to consider only students who did not receive an offer to a school they ranked higher than the one to which they matched.Survey participants were asked whether they qualify for FRL(free and reduced lunch, the DOE measure of low-income status)diversity in admissions (DIA) set-asides, and whether their students had a student with disability (SWD) designation. They were given the choice to decline to answer these questions, in which case their answers were processed in the most conservative way to determine cutoffs: for instance, for a student whose FRL status is unknown,their acceptance to a school can only be used to increase the (less restrictive) DIA cutoff lower bound, while their rejection from a school can only be used to lower the (more restrictive) inDIAn cutoff upper-bound. Note that SWD are handled through a separate process, and different designations will have access to different programs. The data analysis does not differentiate among SWDstatuses.It is worth noting that families get no direct benefit from par-ticipating in the survey as information is collected after admission placements are communicated to families. Anecdotal information from parent groups’ discussions shows that participants are mo-tivated by wanting to understand the process better and helping future applicants. After the 2023 admission season, in which lottery numbers were made available to all applicants from the beginning,families requested that the survey be run again, as they had found the previous years’ results useful to create their choice lists. As of the writing of this article (May 2023), the high-school survey for the 2023 admission season has received 647 answers. The crowdsourcing survey’s goal is to gain a better understanding of the admission odds and to potentially identify issues with the process. It is not meant to be exhaustive, the recruitment of par-ticipants was done through online parent groups and mailing list and as a consequence skews toward families that speak English and are well-informed. Survey answers are not representative of the whole applicant population: respondents are clustered in some geo-graphical areas, skew higher income and higher-achieving than the DOE student population. For instance, in 2022, some high schools are using a coarse academic priority grouping to select students with a minimum GPA. All answers to the HS survey reported their student being placed in academic Group 1 for screened school ad-missions (63% of students citywide were placed in Group 1, from data received by CCHS, the Citywide Council on High Schools –selected parent body). This does not impact the correctness of thecutoff information derived from the surveys but does impact the completeness of the information. As such, the results are bound to be incomplete and to miss a large number of schools.Data, such as priority group eligibility, is self-reported by parents,and errors in data entry are possible. The data is sparse, data is missing for many schools, and it is skewed toward some schools and districts (where the survey was shared). In many cases, thecutoff could not be narrowed precisely, so the results only identified a range of lottery numbers where the cutoff falls.Table 1 reports on the statistics of the data generated by each year's survey. The overall school systems statistics are given in the last column but only include data from 2021 and 2022 [11] as the2023 data was not available as of the writing of this article. As noted above, the demographics of survey participants is skewed towards higher-income students and students who do not have disabilities, although the representation of these two categories improved from year to year. Approximately 436 high schools participate in the match (the exact number is not clear as some schools are often added or removed at the last minute; the count was generated from the most recent (2021) High School Directory data [24]. Some Schools have several programs to which students can apply, the survey results differentiate among these programs [22]. The survey data contains information from about a quarter of the schools.4.An interesting data point from Table 1 is the percentage of un-matched students in the dataset. In 2021 and 2022, 7% of students citywide were unmatched. The rate of unmatched survey partici-pants for 2022 is close to the actual citywide rate, but the rate of unmatched survey students for 2021 is much higher. This is likely due to a few reasons:(1) In 2021, families had to FOIL their lottery number to gain access to it. Those who did go through the process were likely to be the ones who were upset at their outcomes and were motivated to understand what happened. In later years,all applicants could see their lottery numbers in the applicant portal.(2) Survey respondents from 2021 were typically from higher-income districts where the rate of unmatched students was 4 It is possible that the proportion of schools to which the survey participants applied is higher, however, we only count schools for which they were considered, i.e., either the school to which they matched, or the schools that they ranked higher than their match higher than the city average (18% in District 2, 12% in District3, 9% in District 15 [11]).5The unmatched rate for the 2023 survey is much lower. Unfortu-nately, the actual unmatched rate is not available as of the writing of this article (May 2023). It is unclear whether the citywide un-matched rate declined, or if survey participants, a self-selected group, most of whom had access to past survey results and were able to tailor their choice list based on their lottery number and past cutoff information, modified their behavior in a way that minimizes their odds of being unmatched. More analysis on possible changes in behavior due to having access to lottery numbers is needed (seeSection 6) Full results and analysis were shared online [22], and made available to NYC families to plan their application. As the details of the odds of admissions at specific schools are not directly relevant to the reader, I will only highlight the main lessons learned from the analysis in this section.• The lottery number had an outsized impact on admissions, including admissions to “screened” schools that considered essays and auditions in their admission process. Several schools used both assessments and grades.Students were ranked on a composite score based on their school-specific assessments (typically essays), and grades. Many students with bad lottery numbers saw these schools as their best hope to get a desirable match, as they could compensate for bad luck in the lottery draw with a strong essay. The results show that essays were graded coarsely, or not at all, and the lottery number was used to break ties, being a major factor in admission for these schools. For instance, to gain admission to Beacon High School, one of the most popular high schools, students needed a perfect 400 assessment score AND a lottery number that started with 6' or lower (a 400 score with a ‘6f’ lottery number was not given an offer). Another school, Manhattan / Hunter Science High School assigned the maximum essay score of 400 to all students who submitted the essay, resulting in students needing a good lottery number (starting with ‘3’ or lower) to gain admission.• The process results in a large amount of wasted time and resources, both on the students’ side and the schoolside. The above results highlight how wasteful in terms of time and resources the process is. Because of the coarseness of the grading, students with no chance of gaining admission to either school because of their bad lottery numbers spent time writing essays and used precious choices on their list for the schools. Meanwhile, teachers spent time grading these essays (at least at Beacon High School), despite the grades not having any impact of these students’ admission chances.• Students are applying to schools for which they are no seats for their priority group. Consider the example of the New Explorations into Science, Technology and Math HighSchool (NEST+m) school, a popular school with thousands of applicants. NEST+m is a K-12 school with priority given to continuing students and a 66% DIA set-aside for low-income students. Historically 53% of offers are given to continu-ing students. However, the demographic data of continuing students shows few students qualifying for the low-income set-aside. Once continuing students, in the top priority group,are given offers, the only remaining seats left are reserved for students who qualify for the set-aside. Non-continuing students who do not qualify for the set-aside have little to no chance of gaining admission to the school. The survey results confirm that fewer than 6 such students received an offer.6 However, students and families are not made aware of this, so hundreds of ineligible students applied, wrote essays,and teachers spent hours grading these essays despite the students having little or no chance of receiving an offer. Hadthis information been available, students might have decided not to include the school as one of their 12 choices, and not to spend the time writing a series of school-specific essays for such low odds.As discussed in Section 2.2, a large number of students ended up not getting matched to any school on their list, especially in one Manhattan district. This was in large part due to pandemic-and diversity-driven changes in admission policy, which greatly reduced the odds of admissions to a number of schools for these students compared to previous years. (Previously, Manhattan students had geographic priority in some selected high-schools, and several high-schools selected students with high GPAs and test scores.) The DOE did not communicate well the impact of the decrease in odds tofamilies.In 2020, the DOE added waitlists to the school match following errors in the match the previous year [6, 33]. Students are automatically added to the waitlist of schools that are higher on their list than the schools to which they matched.The process that had been communicated to families during DOEZoom admission events, and noted on the DOE website stated that:“For waitlists, each applicant receives a new random number for each waitlist they are on.”It would be unfair for students with “bad"" lottery numbers to be penalized twice. The fairest way to handle the waitlists would be to reverse lottery numbers, but redrawing them is a reasonably fair alternative [13]. Students are given the opportunity to add themselves to wait lists of schools they did not list in the main round, but they will have lower priority than students who had listed the schools originally. This unfortunately creates new strategic incentives: a student with a bad main round lottery number may be lucky in the waitlist round and receive a good lottery number at a high-demand school that they wish to attend, but to have a realistic chance of being admitted from the waitlist, they have to list the school in the main round (otherwise their waitlist position will be after all students who have listed the school). Optimizing for waitlists is risky as it requires allocating one (or more) of the 12 choices in the main round for a potential shot at a good waitlist outcome. This will mechanically increase the chances of being unmatched for students who do not have a guaranteed placement. It also requires families to apply complex game theory reasoning to their school application decisions, and evaluate the tradeoffs between the risk of being unmatched and the opportunity for an additional chance in the lottery for their most preferred school(s). Finally, there is very little information as to the odds of admissions from waitlists; many schools seldom admit any students from their waitlists, and others made extensive use of them. However, there is no transparency on the number of students who were admitted from waitlists. Despite the published policy of redrawing lottery numbers, in July 2022 the DOE confirmed what many parents have suspected based on comparing their waitlist numbers: the lottery numbers had not been redrawn for a subset of schools. The reasons for this change in policy were not given. It is possible it was due to some implementation oversight. This change in published policy has two major drawbacks.• Unfairness. Students with bad original random numbers received consistently bad waitlist numbers, students with good original numbers were at the top of many waitlists. This Led to unfair situations where students with good placements in the main round were given multiple waitlist offers to popular schools, while students with no match in the main round had no hope to get an offer. This was an additional blow for students with bad application lottery numbers who had hoped to have better luck in the waitlist process. It also meant many families had wasted some of their choices on false hope.• Negative effect on diversity initiatives. Schools do not keep separate waitlists for students eligible for the low-income set-asides. The mechanics of the set-aside means that the admission lottery cutoffs for DIA-eligible students are higher than those of non-eligible students. Because the lottery numbers are not redrawn for the waitlists, there is now a perverse effect where students at the top of the list are all non-eligible. This means that schools that admit studentsfrom their waitlists are diluting the effect of their diversity initiatives and the percentage of low-income students.

37,SkewTowardsNonDisabled,constrainsAgent,Families,"To identify the cutoffs to gain admissions to various middle- and high-schools, I used a crowdsourcing survey where families were asked to enter their lottery number (only the first two characters to preserve anonymity), the school to which they matched, and the schools they ranked higher than their match. They were also asked to enter information on which priority group their students qualified for. The survey was done via Google Forms, answers were kept completely anonymous, and no identifying (or re-identifying)information was requested.

The survey data contains information from about a quarter of the schools.4.An interesting data point from Table 1 is the percentage of un-matched students in the dataset. In 2021 and 2022, 7% of students citywide were unmatched. The rate of unmatched survey partici-pants for 2022 is close to the actual citywide rate, but the rate of unmatched survey students for 2021 is much higher. This is likely due to a few reasons:(1) In 2021, families had to FOIL their lottery number to gain access to it. Those who did go through the process were likely to be the ones who were upset at their outcomes and were motivated to understand what happened. In later years,all applicants could see their lottery numbers in the applicant portal.(2) Survey respondents from 2021 were typically from higher-income districts where the rate of unmatched students was 4 It is possible that the proportion of schools to which the survey participants applied is higher, however, we only count schools for which they were considered, i.e., either the school to which they matched, or the schools that they ranked higher than their match higher than the city average (18% in District 2, 12% in District3, 9% in District 15 [11]).5The unmatched rate for the 2023 survey is much lower. Unfortu-nately, the actual unmatched rate is not available as of the writing of this article (May 2023). It is unclear whether the citywide un-matched rate declined, or if survey participants, a self-selected group, most of whom had access to past survey results and were able to tailor their choice list based on their lottery number and past cutoff information, modified their behavior in a way that minimizes their odds of being unmatched. More analysis on possible changes in behavior due to having access to lottery numbers is needed (seeSection 6) Full results and analysis were shared online [22], and made available to NYC families to plan their application. As the details of the odds of admissions at specific schools are not directly relevant to the reader, I will only highlight the main lessons learned from the analysis in this section.• The lottery number had an outsized impact on admissions, including admissions to “screened” schools that considered essays and auditions in their admission process. Several schools used both assessments and grades.Students were ranked on a composite score based on their school-specific assessments (typically essays), and grades. Many students with bad lottery numbers saw these schools as their best hope to get a desirable match, as they could compensate for bad luck in the lottery draw with a strong essay. The results show that essays were graded coarsely, or not at all, and the lottery number was used to break ties, being a major factor in admission for these schools. For instance, to gain admission to Beacon High School, one of the most popular high schools, students needed a perfect 400 assessment score AND a lottery number that started with 6' or lower (a 400 score with a ‘6f’ lottery number was not given an offer). Another school, Manhattan / Hunter Science High School assigned the maximum essay score of 400 to all students who submitted the essay, resulting in students needing a good lottery number (starting with ‘3’ or lower) to gain admission.• The process results in a large amount of wasted time and resources, both on the students’ side and the schoolside. The above results highlight how wasteful in terms of time and resources the process is. Because of the coarseness of the grading, students with no chance of gaining admission to either school because of their bad lottery numbers spent time writing essays and used precious choices on their list for the schools. Meanwhile, teachers spent time grading these essays (at least at Beacon High School), despite the grades not having any impact of these students’ admission chances.• Students are applying to schools for which they are no seats for their priority group. Consider the example of the New Explorations into Science, Technology and Math HighSchool (NEST+m) school, a popular school with thousands of applicants. NEST+m is a K-12 school with priority given to continuing students and a 66% DIA set-aside for low-income students. Historically 53% of offers are given to continu-ing students. However, the demographic data of continuing students shows few students qualifying for the low-income set-aside. Once continuing students, in the top priority group,are given offers, the only remaining seats left are reserved for students who qualify for the set-aside. Non-continuing students who do not qualify for the set-aside have little to no chance of gaining admission to the school. The survey results confirm that fewer than 6 such students received an offer.6 However, students and families are not made aware of this, so hundreds of ineligible students applied, wrote essays,and teachers spent hours grading these essays despite the students having little or no chance of receiving an offer. Hadthis information been available, students might have decided not to include the school as one of their 12 choices, and not to spend the time writing a series of school-specific essays for such low odds.As discussed in Section 2.2, a large number of students ended up not getting matched to any school on their list, especially in one Manhattan district. This was in large part due to pandemic-and diversity-driven changes in admission policy, which greatly reduced the odds of admissions to a number of schools for these students compared to previous years. (Previously, Manhattan students had geographic priority in some selected high-schools, and several high-schools selected students with high GPAs and test scores.) The DOE did not communicate well the impact of the decrease in odds tofamilies.In 2020, the DOE added waitlists to the school match following errors in the match the previous year [6, 33]. Students are automatically added to the waitlist of schools that are higher on their list than the schools to which they matched.The process that had been communicated to families during DOEZoom admission events, and noted on the DOE website stated that:“For waitlists, each applicant receives a new random number for each waitlist they are on.”It would be unfair for students with “bad"" lottery numbers to be penalized twice. The fairest way to handle the waitlists would be to reverse lottery numbers, but redrawing them is a reasonably fair alternative [13]. Students are given the opportunity to add themselves to wait lists of schools they did not list in the main round, but they will have lower priority than students who had listed the schools originally. This unfortunately creates new strategic incentives: a student with a bad main round lottery number may be lucky in the waitlist round and receive a good lottery number at a high-demand school that they wish to attend, but to have a realistic chance of being admitted from the waitlist, they have to list the school in the main round (otherwise their waitlist position will be after all students who have listed the school). Optimizing for waitlists is risky as it requires allocating one (or more) of the 12 choices in the main round for a potential shot at a good waitlist outcome. This will mechanically increase the chances of being unmatched for students who do not have a guaranteed placement. It also requires families to apply complex game theory reasoning to their school application decisions, and evaluate the tradeoffs between the risk of being unmatched and the opportunity for an additional chance in the lottery for their most preferred school(s). Finally, there is very little information as to the odds of admissions from waitlists; many schools seldom admit any students from their waitlists, and others made extensive use of them. However, there is no transparency on the number of students who were admitted from waitlists. Despite the published policy of redrawing lottery numbers, in July 2022 the DOE confirmed what many parents have suspected based on comparing their waitlist numbers: the lottery numbers had not been redrawn for a subset of schools. The reasons for this change in policy were not given. It is possible it was due to some implementation oversight. This change in published policy has two major drawbacks.• Unfairness. Students with bad original random numbers received consistently bad waitlist numbers, students with good original numbers were at the top of many waitlists. This Led to unfair situations where students with good placements in the main round were given multiple waitlist offers to popular schools, while students with no match in the main round had no hope to get an offer. This was an additional blow for students with bad application lottery numbers who had hoped to have better luck in the waitlist process. It also meant many families had wasted some of their choices on false hope.• Negative effect on diversity initiatives. Schools do not keep separate waitlists for students eligible for the low-income set-asides. The mechanics of the set-aside means that the admission lottery cutoffs for DIA-eligible students are higher than those of non-eligible students. Because the lottery numbers are not redrawn for the waitlists, there is now a perverse effect where students at the top of the list are all non-eligible. This means that schools that admit studentsfrom their waitlists are diluting the effect of their diversity initiatives and the percentage of low-income students.

39,LotteryNumber,influencesPrecept,Wastefulness,"To identify the cutoffs to gain admissions to various middle- and high-schools, I used a crowdsourcing survey where families were asked to enter their lottery number (only the first two characters to preserve anonymity), the school to which they matched, and the schools they ranked higher than their match. They were also asked to enter information on which priority group their students qualified for. The survey was done via Google Forms, answers were kept completely anonymous, and no identifying (or re-identifying)information was requested. The survey was approved by Rutgers Institutional Review Board. Participants were recruited through messages on social media parent groups.The survey result data was used to identify the “worst” lottery number that received an offer to the school, and the “best” that did not. The corresponding percentile in the theoretical distribution was used to get a lower and upper bound of the odds of matching to a given school. Note that these odds represent chances of matching to a given school or to a school ranked higher on the student list, as the matching algorithm will only consider a student for a school if they haven’t matched to a school they ranked higher.The full results of the surveys were published online [22], allow-ing families applying in later years to have a better idea of the odds of admissions at their preferred schools and to adjust their ranked list accordingly. For the 2021 admission season, the survey received 136 (107 with lottery numbers) answers from high-school applicants and 125 (70 with lottery numbers) answers from middle-school ap-plicants. Note that in 2021 the DOE did not provide families with their lottery number, accessing it required parents to file a FOILrequest. In 2022, the DOE started including the lottery number in the students’ admission portal, but it did so only a week before applications were due. For the 2022 admission season, the survey received 253 answers from high-school applicants and 102 answers from middle-school applicants.After a manual data cleaning step to remove obvious errors in data entry, the highest (worst) lottery number of all students who received an offer to a school was extracted: this identifies a lower bound for the school cutoff. To identify the higher bound,the process is similar but needs to consider only students who did not receive an offer to a school they ranked higher than the one to which they matched.Survey participants were asked whether they qualify for FRL(free and reduced lunch, the DOE measure of low-income status)diversity in admissions (DIA) set-asides, and whether their students had a student with disability (SWD) designation. They were given the choice to decline to answer these questions, in which case their answers were processed in the most conservative way to determine cutoffs: for instance, for a student whose FRL status is unknown,their acceptance to a school can only be used to increase the (less restrictive) DIA cutoff lower bound, while their rejection from a school can only be used to lower the (more restrictive) inDIAn cutoff upper-bound. Note that SWD are handled through a separate process, and different designations will have access to different programs. The data analysis does not differentiate among SWDstatuses.It is worth noting that families get no direct benefit from par-ticipating in the survey as information is collected after admission placements are communicated to families. Anecdotal information from parent groups’ discussions shows that participants are mo-tivated by wanting to understand the process better and helping future applicants. After the 2023 admission season, in which lottery numbers were made available to all applicants from the beginning,families requested that the survey be run again, as they had found the previous years’ results useful to create their choice lists. As of the writing of this article (May 2023), the high-school survey for the 2023 admission season has received 647 answers. The crowdsourcing survey’s goal is to gain a better understanding of the admission odds and to potentially identify issues with the process. It is not meant to be exhaustive, the recruitment of par-ticipants was done through online parent groups and mailing list and as a consequence skews toward families that speak English and are well-informed. Survey answers are not representative of the whole applicant population: respondents are clustered in some geo-graphical areas, skew higher income and higher-achieving than the DOE student population. For instance, in 2022, some high schools are using a coarse academic priority grouping to select students with a minimum GPA. All answers to the HS survey reported their student being placed in academic Group 1 for screened school ad-missions (63% of students citywide were placed in Group 1, from data received by CCHS, the Citywide Council on High Schools –selected parent body). This does not impact the correctness of thecutoff information derived from the surveys but does impact the completeness of the information. As such, the results are bound to be incomplete and to miss a large number of schools.Data, such as priority group eligibility, is self-reported by parents,and errors in data entry are possible. The data is sparse, data is missing for many schools, and it is skewed toward some schools and districts (where the survey was shared). In many cases, thecutoff could not be narrowed precisely, so the results only identified a range of lottery numbers where the cutoff falls.Table 1 reports on the statistics of the data generated by each year's survey. The overall school systems statistics are given in the last column but only include data from 2021 and 2022 [11] as the2023 data was not available as of the writing of this article. As noted above, the demographics of survey participants is skewed towards higher-income students and students who do not have disabilities, although the representation of these two categories improved from year to year. Approximately 436 high schools participate in the match (the exact number is not clear as some schools are often added or removed at the last minute; the count was generated from the most recent (2021) High School Directory data [24].

Hadthis information been available, students might have decided not to include the school as one of their 12 choices, and not to spend the time writing a series of school-specific essays for such low odds.As discussed in Section 2.2, a large number of students ended up not getting matched to any school on their list, especially in one Manhattan district. This was in large part due to pandemic-and diversity-driven changes in admission policy, which greatly reduced the odds of admissions to a number of schools for these students compared to previous years. (Previously, Manhattan students had geographic priority in some selected high-schools, and several high-schools selected students with high GPAs and test scores.) The DOE did not communicate well the impact of the decrease in odds tofamilies.In 2020, the DOE added waitlists to the school match following errors in the match the previous year [6, 33]. Students are automatically added to the waitlist of schools that are higher on their list than the schools to which they matched.The process that had been communicated to families during DOEZoom admission events, and noted on the DOE website stated that:“For waitlists, each applicant receives a new random number for each waitlist they are on.”It would be unfair for students with “bad"" lottery numbers to be penalized twice. The fairest way to handle the waitlists would be to reverse lottery numbers, but redrawing them is a reasonably fair alternative [13]. Students are given the opportunity to add themselves to wait lists of schools they did not list in the main round, but they will have lower priority than students who had listed the schools originally. This unfortunately creates new strategic incentives: a student with a bad main round lottery number may be lucky in the waitlist round and receive a good lottery number at a high-demand school that they wish to attend, but to have a realistic chance of being admitted from the waitlist, they have to list the school in the main round (otherwise their waitlist position will be after all students who have listed the school). Optimizing for waitlists is risky as it requires allocating one (or more) of the 12 choices in the main round for a potential shot at a good waitlist outcome. This will mechanically increase the chances of being unmatched for students who do not have a guaranteed placement. It also requires families to apply complex game theory reasoning to their school application decisions, and evaluate the tradeoffs between the risk of being unmatched and the opportunity for an additional chance in the lottery for their most preferred school(s). Finally, there is very little information as to the odds of admissions from waitlists; many schools seldom admit any students from their waitlists, and others made extensive use of them. However, there is no transparency on the number of students who were admitted from waitlists. Despite the published policy of redrawing lottery numbers, in July 2022 the DOE confirmed what many parents have suspected based on comparing their waitlist numbers: the lottery numbers had not been redrawn for a subset of schools. The reasons for this change in policy were not given. It is possible it was due to some implementation oversight. This change in published policy has two major drawbacks.• Unfairness. Students with bad original random numbers received consistently bad waitlist numbers, students with good original numbers were at the top of many waitlists. This Led to unfair situations where students with good placements in the main round were given multiple waitlist offers to popular schools, while students with no match in the main round had no hope to get an offer. This was an additional blow for students with bad application lottery numbers who had hoped to have better luck in the waitlist process. It also meant many families had wasted some of their choices on false hope.• Negative effect on diversity initiatives. Schools do not keep separate waitlists for students eligible for the low-income set-asides. The mechanics of the set-aside means that the admission lottery cutoffs for DIA-eligible students are higher than those of non-eligible students. Because the lottery numbers are not redrawn for the waitlists, there is now a perverse effect where students at the top of the list are all non-eligible. This means that schools that admit studentsfrom their waitlists are diluting the effect of their diversity initiatives and the percentage of low-income students. ",439-41,The DOE did not communicate well the impact of the decrease in odds to families.
41,GamingTheWaitlist,constrainsAgent,Students,"To identify the cutoffs to gain admissions to various middle- and high-schools, I used a crowdsourcing survey where families were asked to enter their lottery number (only the first two characters to preserve anonymity), the school to which they matched, and the schools they ranked higher than their match. They were also asked to enter information on which priority group their students qualified for. The survey was done via Google Forms, answers were kept completely anonymous, and no identifying (or re-identifying)information was requested. The survey was approved by Rutgers Institutional Review Board. Participants were recruited through messages on social media parent groups.The survey result data was used to identify the “worst” lottery number that received an offer to the school, and the “best” that did not. The corresponding percentile in the theoretical distribution was used to get a lower and upper bound of the odds of matching to a given school. Note that these odds represent chances of matching to a given school or to a school ranked higher on the student list, as the matching algorithm will only consider a student for a school if they haven’t matched to a school they ranked higher.The full results of the surveys were published online [22], allow-ing families applying in later years to have a better idea of the odds of admissions at their preferred schools and to adjust their ranked list accordingly. For the 2021 admission season, the survey received 136 (107 with lottery numbers) answers from high-school applicants and 125 (70 with lottery numbers) answers from middle-school ap-plicants. Note that in 2021 the DOE did not provide families with their lottery number, accessing it required parents to file a FOILrequest. In 2022, the DOE started including the lottery number in the students’ admission portal, but it did so only a week before applications were due. For the 2022 admission season, the survey received 253 answers from high-school applicants and 102 answers from middle-school applicants.After a manual data cleaning step to remove obvious errors in data entry, the highest (worst) lottery number of all students who received an offer to a school was extracted: this identifies a lower bound for the school cutoff. To identify the higher bound,the process is similar but needs to consider only students who did not receive an offer to a school they ranked higher than the one to which they matched.Survey participants were asked whether they qualify for FRL(free and reduced lunch, the DOE measure of low-income status)diversity in admissions (DIA) set-asides, and whether their students had a student with disability (SWD) designation. They were given the choice to decline to answer these questions, in which case their answers were processed in the most conservative way to determine cutoffs: for instance, for a student whose FRL status is unknown,their acceptance to a school can only be used to increase the (less restrictive) DIA cutoff lower bound, while their rejection from a school can only be used to lower the (more restrictive) inDIAn cutoff upper-bound. Note that SWD are handled through a separate process, and different designations will have access to different programs. The data analysis does not differentiate among SWDstatuses.It is worth noting that families get no direct benefit from par-ticipating in the survey as information is collected after admission placements are communicated to families. Anecdotal information from parent groups’ discussions shows that participants are mo-tivated by wanting to understand the process better and helping future applicants. After the 2023 admission season, in which lottery numbers were made available to all applicants from the beginning,families requested that the survey be run again, as they had found the previous years’ results useful to create their choice lists. As of the writing of this article (May 2023), the high-school survey for the 2023 admission season has received 647 answers. The crowdsourcing survey’s goal is to gain a better understanding of the admission odds and to potentially identify issues with the process. It is not meant to be exhaustive, the recruitment of par-ticipants was done through online parent groups and mailing list and as a consequence skews toward families that speak English and are well-informed. Survey answers are not representative of the whole applicant population: respondents are clustered in some geo-graphical areas, skew higher income and higher-achieving than the DOE student population. For instance, in 2022, some high schools are using a coarse academic priority grouping to select students with a minimum GPA. All answers to the HS survey reported their student being placed in academic Group 1 for screened school ad-missions (63% of students citywide were placed in Group 1, from data received by CCHS, the Citywide Council on High Schools –selected parent body). This does not impact the correctness of thecutoff information derived from the surveys but does impact the completeness of the information. As such, the results are bound to be incomplete and to miss a large number of schools.Data, such as priority group eligibility, is self-reported by parents,and errors in data entry are possible. The data is sparse, data is missing for many schools, and it is skewed toward some schools and districts (where the survey was shared). In many cases, thecutoff could not be narrowed precisely, so the results only identified a range of lottery numbers where the cutoff falls.Table 1 reports on the statistics of the data generated by each year's survey. The overall school systems statistics are given in the last column but only include data from 2021 and 2022 [11] as the2023 data was not available as of the writing of this article. As noted above, the demographics of survey participants is skewed towards higher-income students and students who do not have disabilities, although the representation of these two categories improved from year to year. Approximately 436 high schools participate in the match (the exact number is not clear as some schools are often added or removed at the last minute; the count was generated from the most recent (2021) High School Directory data [24]. Some Schools have several programs to which students can apply, the survey results differentiate among these programs [22]. The survey data contains information from about a quarter of the schools.4.An interesting data point from Table 1 is the percentage of un-matched students in the dataset. In 2021 and 2022, 7% of students citywide were unmatched. The rate of unmatched survey partici-pants for 2022 is close to the actual citywide rate, but the rate of unmatched survey students for 2021 is much higher. This is likely due to a few reasons:(1) In 2021, families had to FOIL their lottery number to gain access to it. Those who did go through the process were likely to be the ones who were upset at their outcomes and were motivated to understand what happened. In later years,all applicants could see their lottery numbers in the applicant portal.(2) Survey respondents from 2021 were typically from higher-income districts where the rate of unmatched students was 4 It is possible that the proportion of schools to which the survey participants applied is higher, however, we only count schools for which they were considered, i.e., either the school to which they matched, or the schools that they ranked higher than their match higher than the city average (18% in District 2, 12% in District3, 9% in District 15 [11]).5The unmatched rate for the 2023 survey is much lower. Unfortu-nately, the actual unmatched rate is not available as of the writing of this article (May 2023). It is unclear whether the citywide un-matched rate declined, or if survey participants, a self-selected group, most of whom had access to past survey results and were able to tailor their choice list based on their lottery number and past cutoff information, modified their behavior in a way that minimizes their odds of being unmatched. More analysis on possible changes in behavior due to having access to lottery numbers is needed (seeSection 6) Full results and analysis were shared online [22], and made available to NYC families to plan their application. As the details of the odds of admissions at specific schools are not directly relevant to the reader, I will only highlight the main lessons learned from the analysis in this section.• The lottery number had an outsized impact on admissions, including admissions to “screened” schools that considered essays and auditions in their admission process. Several schools used both assessments and grades.Students were ranked on a composite score based on their school-specific assessments (typically essays), and grades. Many students with bad lottery numbers saw these schools as their best hope to get a desirable match, as they could compensate for bad luck in the lottery draw with a strong essay. The results show that essays were graded coarsely, or not at all, and the lottery number was used to break ties, being a major factor in admission for these schools. For instance, to gain admission to Beacon High School, one of the most popular high schools, students needed a perfect 400 assessment score AND a lottery number that started with 6' or lower (a 400 score with a ‘6f’ lottery number was not given an offer). Another school, Manhattan / Hunter Science High School assigned the maximum essay score of 400 to all students who submitted the essay, resulting in students needing a good lottery number (starting with ‘3’ or lower) to gain admission.• The process results in a large amount of wasted time and resources, both on the students’ side and the schoolside. The above results highlight how wasteful in terms of time and resources the process is. Because of the coarseness of the grading, students with no chance of gaining admission to either school because of their bad lottery numbers spent time writing essays and used precious choices on their list for the schools. Meanwhile, teachers spent time grading these essays (at least at Beacon High School), despite the grades not having any impact of these students’ admission chances.• Students are applying to schools for which they are no seats for their priority group. Consider the example of the New Explorations into Science, Technology and Math HighSchool (NEST+m) school, a popular school with thousands of applicants. NEST+m is a K-12 school with priority given to continuing students and a 66% DIA set-aside for low-income students. Historically 53% of offers are given to continu-ing students. However, the demographic data of continuing students shows few students qualifying for the low-income set-aside. Once continuing students, in the top priority group,are given offers, the only remaining seats left are reserved for students who qualify for the set-aside. Non-continuing students who do not qualify for the set-aside have little to no chance of gaining admission to the school. The survey results confirm that fewer than 6 such students received an offer.6 However, students and families are not made aware of this, so hundreds of ineligible students applied, wrote essays,and teachers spent hours grading these essays despite the students having little or no chance of receiving an offer. Hadthis information been available, students might have decided not to include the school as one of their 12 choices, and not to spend the time writing a series of school-specific essays for such low odds.As discussed in Section 2.2, a large number of students ended up not getting matched to any school on their list, especially in one Manhattan district.

Participants were recruited through messages on social media parent groups.The survey result data was used to identify the “worst” lottery number that received an offer to the school, and the “best” that did not. The corresponding percentile in the theoretical distribution was used to get a lower and upper bound of the odds of matching to a given school. Note that these odds represent chances of matching to a given school or to a school ranked higher on the student list, as the matching algorithm will only consider a student for a school if they haven’t matched to a school they ranked higher.The full results of the surveys were published online [22], allow-ing families applying in later years to have a better idea of the odds of admissions at their preferred schools and to adjust their ranked list accordingly. For the 2021 admission season, the survey received 136 (107 with lottery numbers) answers from high-school applicants and 125 (70 with lottery numbers) answers from middle-school ap-plicants. Note that in 2021 the DOE did not provide families with their lottery number, accessing it required parents to file a FOILrequest. In 2022, the DOE started including the lottery number in the students’ admission portal, but it did so only a week before applications were due. For the 2022 admission season, the survey received 253 answers from high-school applicants and 102 answers from middle-school applicants.After a manual data cleaning step to remove obvious errors in data entry, the highest (worst) lottery number of all students who received an offer to a school was extracted: this identifies a lower bound for the school cutoff. To identify the higher bound,the process is similar but needs to consider only students who did not receive an offer to a school they ranked higher than the one to which they matched.Survey participants were asked whether they qualify for FRL(free and reduced lunch, the DOE measure of low-income status)diversity in admissions (DIA) set-asides, and whether their students had a student with disability (SWD) designation. They were given the choice to decline to answer these questions, in which case their answers were processed in the most conservative way to determine cutoffs: for instance, for a student whose FRL status is unknown,their acceptance to a school can only be used to increase the (less restrictive) DIA cutoff lower bound, while their rejection from a school can only be used to lower the (more restrictive) inDIAn cutoff upper-bound. Note that SWD are handled through a separate process, and different designations will have access to different programs. The data analysis does not differentiate among SWDstatuses.It is worth noting that families get no direct benefit from par-ticipating in the survey as information is collected after admission placements are communicated to families. Anecdotal information from parent groups’ discussions shows that participants are mo-tivated by wanting to understand the process better and helping future applicants. After the 2023 admission season, in which lottery numbers were made available to all applicants from the beginning,families requested that the survey be run again, as they had found the previous years’ results useful to create their choice lists. As of the writing of this article (May 2023), the high-school survey for the 2023 admission season has received 647 answers. The crowdsourcing survey’s goal is to gain a better understanding of the admission odds and to potentially identify issues with the process. It is not meant to be exhaustive, the recruitment of par-ticipants was done through online parent groups and mailing list and as a consequence skews toward families that speak English and are well-informed. Survey answers are not representative of the whole applicant population: respondents are clustered in some geo-graphical areas, skew higher income and higher-achieving than the DOE student population. For instance, in 2022, some high schools are using a coarse academic priority grouping to select students with a minimum GPA. All answers to the HS survey reported their student being placed in academic Group 1 for screened school ad-missions (63% of students citywide were placed in Group 1, from data received by CCHS, the Citywide Council on High Schools –selected parent body). This does not impact the correctness of thecutoff information derived from the surveys but does impact the completeness of the information. As such, the results are bound to be incomplete and to miss a large number of schools.Data, such as priority group eligibility, is self-reported by parents,and errors in data entry are possible. The data is sparse, data is missing for many schools, and it is skewed toward some schools and districts (where the survey was shared). In many cases, thecutoff could not be narrowed precisely, so the results only identified a range of lottery numbers where the cutoff falls.Table 1 reports on the statistics of the data generated by each year's survey. The overall school systems statistics are given in the last column but only include data from 2021 and 2022 [11] as the2023 data was not available as of the writing of this article. As noted above, the demographics of survey participants is skewed towards higher-income students and students who do not have disabilities, although the representation of these two categories improved from year to year. Approximately 436 high schools participate in the match (the exact number is not clear as some schools are often added or removed at the last minute; the count was generated from the most recent (2021) High School Directory data [24]. Some Schools have several programs to which students can apply, the survey results differentiate among these programs [22]. The survey data contains information from about a quarter of the schools.4.An interesting data point from Table 1 is the percentage of un-matched students in the dataset. In 2021 and 2022, 7% of students citywide were unmatched. The rate of unmatched survey partici-pants for 2022 is close to the actual citywide rate, but the rate of unmatched survey students for 2021 is much higher. This is likely due to a few reasons:(1) In 2021, families had to FOIL their lottery number to gain access to it. Those who did go through the process were likely to be the ones who were upset at their outcomes and were motivated to understand what happened. In later years,all applicants could see their lottery numbers in the applicant portal.(2) Survey respondents from 2021 were typically from higher-income districts where the rate of unmatched students was 4 It is possible that the proportion of schools to which the survey participants applied is higher, however, we only count schools for which they were considered, i.e., either the school to which they matched, or the schools that they ranked higher than their match higher than the city average (18% in District 2, 12% in District3, 9% in District 15 [11]).5The unmatched rate for the 2023 survey is much lower. Unfortu-nately, the actual unmatched rate is not available as of the writing of this article (May 2023). It is unclear whether the citywide un-matched rate declined, or if survey participants, a self-selected group, most of whom had access to past survey results and were able to tailor their choice list based on their lottery number and past cutoff information, modified their behavior in a way that minimizes their odds of being unmatched. More analysis on possible changes in behavior due to having access to lottery numbers is needed (seeSection 6) Full results and analysis were shared online [22], and made available to NYC families to plan their application. As the details of the odds of admissions at specific schools are not directly relevant to the reader, I will only highlight the main lessons learned from the analysis in this section.• The lottery number had an outsized impact on admissions, including admissions to “screened” schools that considered essays and auditions in their admission process. Several schools used both assessments and grades.Students were ranked on a composite score based on their school-specific assessments (typically essays), and grades. Many students with bad lottery numbers saw these schools as their best hope to get a desirable match, as they could compensate for bad luck in the lottery draw with a strong essay. The results show that essays were graded coarsely, or not at all, and the lottery number was used to break ties, being a major factor in admission for these schools. For instance, to gain admission to Beacon High School, one of the most popular high schools, students needed a perfect 400 assessment score AND a lottery number that started with 6' or lower (a 400 score with a ‘6f’ lottery number was not given an offer). Another school, Manhattan / Hunter Science High School assigned the maximum essay score of 400 to all students who submitted the essay, resulting in students needing a good lottery number (starting with ‘3’ or lower) to gain admission.• The process results in a large amount of wasted time and resources, both on the students’ side and the schoolside. The above results highlight how wasteful in terms of time and resources the process is. Because of the coarseness of the grading, students with no chance of gaining admission to either school because of their bad lottery numbers spent time writing essays and used precious choices on their list for the schools. Meanwhile, teachers spent time grading these essays (at least at Beacon High School), despite the grades not having any impact of these students’ admission chances.• Students are applying to schools for which they are no seats for their priority group. Consider the example of the New Explorations into Science, Technology and Math HighSchool (NEST+m) school, a popular school with thousands of applicants. NEST+m is a K-12 school with priority given to continuing students and a 66% DIA set-aside for low-income students. Historically 53% of offers are given to continu-ing students. However, the demographic data of continuing students shows few students qualifying for the low-income set-aside. Once continuing students, in the top priority group,are given offers, the only remaining seats left are reserved for students who qualify for the set-aside. Non-continuing students who do not qualify for the set-aside have little to no chance of gaining admission to the school. The survey results confirm that fewer than 6 such students received an offer.6 However, students and families are not made aware of this, so hundreds of ineligible students applied, wrote essays,and teachers spent hours grading these essays despite the students having little or no chance of receiving an offer. Hadthis information been available, students might have decided not to include the school as one of their 12 choices, and not to spend the time writing a series of school-specific essays for such low odds.As discussed in Section 2.2, a large number of students ended up not getting matched to any school on their list, especially in one Manhattan district. This was in large part due to pandemic-and diversity-driven changes in admission policy, which greatly reduced the odds of admissions to a number of schools for these students compared to previous years. (Previously, Manhattan students had geographic priority in some selected high-schools, and several high-schools selected students with high GPAs and test scores.) The DOE did not communicate well the impact of the decrease in odds tofamilies.In 2020, the DOE added waitlists to the school match following errors in the match the previous year [6, 33]. Students are automatically added to the waitlist of schools that are higher on their list than the schools to which they matched.The process that had been communicated to families during DOEZoom admission events, and noted on the DOE website stated that:“For waitlists, each applicant receives a new random number for each waitlist they are on.”It would be unfair for students with “bad"" lottery numbers to be penalized twice. The fairest way to handle the waitlists would be to reverse lottery numbers, but redrawing them is a reasonably fair alternative [13]. Students are given the opportunity to add themselves to wait lists of schools they did not list in the main round, but they will have lower priority than students who had listed the schools originally. This unfortunately creates new strategic incentives: a student with a bad main round lottery number may be lucky in the waitlist round and receive a good lottery number at a high-demand school that they wish to attend, but to have a realistic chance of being admitted from the waitlist, they have to list the school in the main round (otherwise their waitlist position will be after all students who have listed the school). Optimizing for waitlists is risky as it requires allocating one (or more) of the 12 choices in the main round for a potential shot at a good waitlist outcome. This will mechanically increase the chances of being unmatched for students who do not have a guaranteed placement. It also requires families to apply complex game theory reasoning to their school application decisions, and evaluate the tradeoffs between the risk of being unmatched and the opportunity for an additional chance in the lottery for their most preferred school(s). Finally, there is very little information as to the odds of admissions from waitlists; many schools seldom admit any students from their waitlists, and others made extensive use of them. However, there is no transparency on the number of students who were admitted from waitlists. Despite the published policy of redrawing lottery numbers, in July 2022 the DOE confirmed what many parents have suspected based on comparing their waitlist numbers: the lottery numbers had not been redrawn for a subset of schools. The reasons for this change in policy were not given. It is possible it was due to some implementation oversight. This change in published policy has two major drawbacks.• Unfairness. Students with bad original random numbers received consistently bad waitlist numbers, students with good original numbers were at the top of many waitlists. This Led to unfair situations where students with good placements in the main round were given multiple waitlist offers to popular schools, while students with no match in the main round had no hope to get an offer. This was an additional blow for students with bad application lottery numbers who had hoped to have better luck in the waitlist process. It also meant many families had wasted some of their choices on false hope.• Negative effect on diversity initiatives. Schools do not keep separate waitlists for students eligible for the low-income set-asides. The mechanics of the set-aside means that the admission lottery cutoffs for DIA-eligible students are higher than those of non-eligible students. Because the lottery numbers are not redrawn for the waitlists, there is now a perverse effect where students at the top of the list are all non-eligible. This means that schools that admit studentsfrom their waitlists are diluting the effect of their diversity initiatives and the percentage of low-income students. ",439-41,schools that admit students from their waitlists are diluting the effect of their diversity initiatives and the percentage of low-income students.
