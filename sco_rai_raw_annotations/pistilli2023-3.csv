9,ModelCards,Artifact,"An example of overlap between regulatory and technical compliance through specifications of technical documentation can be found in the primary role of the model card as a governance tool in upcoming AI regulations, such as the EU AI Act. In the case of the EU AI Act, the European Commission has taken a risk-based approach distinguishing between different legal regimes for different AI application scenarios. Whereas practices such as social scoring are forbidden under article 5 [16], practices such as using AI applications in educational settings or critical infrastructure (e.g., electricity central management) are considered high-risk systems. The latter are allowed to be distributed and commercialized under a large set of regulatory compliance require-ments involving data governance (article 10, [16]), ""transparency and documentation"" (article 11, [16]), and the development of risk management systems of the AI application at sight coupled with technical specifications (e.g., article 13 and Annex IV [16]). A considerable amount of the information required in the afore-mentioned articles may be found in the technical artifact that isa model card. At the time of writing this paper, the EU AI Actis being discussed at the European Parliament and will finally be negotiated in the trilogue phase between the European Commis-sion, the Council of the EU, and the European Parliament. However, documentation-related requirements are likely not being critically modified. Therefore, we expect the documentation format promoted by model cards to be implemented for regulatory compliance purposes, especially for provisions such as article 11, 13 and AnnexIV. Consequently, whereas the model card was originally conceived as a documentation tool, it can also become a regulatory compliance instrument. This nexus between these two governance instruments impacts a third instrument, licenses. The latter, informed by the technical capabilities and limitations of the model (technical compliance), aware of regulatory requirements present in AI laws (legal compliance), and acknowledging a set of values framed under the ethical charter (ethical compliance), are going to transpose these different governance dimensions into a set of contractual terms enabling users to use ML artifacts according to a set of use restric-tions reflecting the values, regulatory requirements, and technical details applied to the ML artifact at sight. Henceforth, the aforementioned mechanisms have the potential to be well articulated with the organic approach that the AI community has taken to AI governance, due to growing socio-ethical concerns and a lack of specific regulation. For instance, both license and documentation tools can well fit the purposes of regulations such as the AI Act. Thus, tools originating from the AI community could be instrumentalized in the short run as regulatory compliance instruments. ",351,the primary role of the model card,

26,ModelCards,influencesPrecept,Regulation,"An example of overlap between regulatory and technical compliance through specifications of technical documentation can be found in the primary role of the model card as a governance tool in upcoming AI regulations, such as the EU AI Act. In the case of the EU AI Act, the European Commission has taken a risk-based approach distinguishing between different legal regimes for different AI application scenarios. Whereas practices such as social scoring are forbidden under article 5 [16], practices such as using AI applications in educational settings or critical infrastructure (e.g., electricity central management) are considered high-risk systems. The latter are allowed to be distributed and commercialized under a large set of regulatory compliance require-ments involving data governance (article 10, [16]), ""transparency and documentation"" (article 11, [16]), and the development of risk management systems of the AI application at sight coupled with technical specifications (e.g., article 13 and Annex IV [16]). A considerable amount of the information required in the afore-mentioned articles may be found in the technical artifact that isa model card. At the time of writing this paper, the EU AI Actis being discussed at the European Parliament and will finally be negotiated in the trilogue phase between the European Commis-sion, the Council of the EU, and the European Parliament. However, documentation-related requirements are likely not being critically modified. Therefore, we expect the documentation format promoted by model cards to be implemented for regulatory compliance purposes, especially for provisions such as article 11, 13 and AnnexIV. Consequently, whereas the model card was originally conceived as a documentation tool, it can also become a regulatory compliance instrument. This nexus between these two governance instruments impacts a third instrument, licenses. The latter, informed by the technical capabilities and limitations of the model (technical compliance), aware of regulatory requirements present in AI laws (legal compliance), and acknowledging a set of values framed under the ethical charter (ethical compliance), are going to transpose these different governance dimensions into a set of contractual terms enabling users to use ML artifacts according to a set of use restric-tions reflecting the values, regulatory requirements, and technical details applied to the ML artifact at sight. Henceforth, the aforementioned mechanisms have the potential to be well articulated with the organic approach that the AI community has taken to AI governance, due to growing socio-ethical concerns and a lack of specific regulation. For instance, both license and documentation tools can well fit the purposes of regulations such as the AI Act. Thus, tools originating from the AI community could be instrumentalized in the short run as regulatory compliance instruments.
