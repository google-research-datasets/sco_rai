9,MultipleTargets,Perceived_Problem,"Prediction models have been widely adopted as the basis for decision-making in domains as diverse as employment, education, lending,and health. Yet, few real world problems readily present themselves as precisely formulated prediction tasks. In particular, there are often many reasonable target variable options. Prior work has argued that this is an important and sometimes underappreciated choice, and has also shown that target choice can have a significant impact on the fairness of the resulting model. However, the existing literature does not offer a formal framework for characterizing the extent to which target choice matters in a particular task. Our work fills this gap by drawing connections between the problem of tar-get choice and recent work on predictive multiplicity. Specifically, we introduce a conceptual and computational framework for assessing how the choice of target affects individuals‚Äô outcomes and selection rate disparities across groups. We call this multi-target multiplicity. Along the way, we refine the study of single-target multiplicity by introducing notions of multiplicity that respect resource constraints‚Äîa feature of many real-world tasks that isn't captured by existing notions of predictive multiplicity. We apply our methods on a healthcare dataset, and show that the level of multiplicity that stems from target variable choice can be greater than that stemming from nearly-optimal models of a single target [...] We demonstrate our framework on a dataset released by Obermeyeret al., which is unique in several ways. The original paper examines patient data for all primary care patients at a large academic hospital. However, due to the sensitivity of the data, the authors were unable to release the dataset in its original form. Instead, they created a publicly available semi-synthetic version of the dataset that is designed to closely mirror the original dataset.4The released dataset contains several related but different outcomes for patients in a given year including total healthcare costs,avoidable healthcare costs (emergency visits and hospitalizations),and number of active chronic illnesses. It also contains a rich set of features about each patient, including demographics (age, sex, race)and information about the patient‚Äôs health and healthcare costs in the previous year. Specifically, there are indicators for individual chronic illnesses that a patient had in the previous year, costs claimed by the patients‚Äô insurer in the previous year, biomarkers for medical tests from the previous year, and medications taken in the previous year.In the original paper, Obermeyer et al. examine a proprietary scoring system used by the hospital to identify high-risk patients.The risk scores are generated by a model designed to predict health-care costs in the current year based on patient demographics and healthcare information available from the previous year. In par-ticular, patients who are assigned risk scores that fall in the 97th percentile or above (i.e., the top 3% of assigned scores) are auto-matically identified for inclusion in the hospital‚Äôs ‚Äúhigh-risk care management‚Äù program.The authors examine the assigned risk scores in detail and show that they contain a significant racial bias. Specifically, they find that Black patients at a given risk score have worse health outcomes,on average, than their White counterparts. The authors trace this bias back to the choice of predicting healthcare costs as the target variable. Due to differences in access to healthcare, White patients tend to have higher healthcare costs, on average, than Black patients of similar health. This difference is then reflected in the developed risk score, leading to the observed racial bias. Obermeyer et al. thengo on to show that there are different target variable choices that exhibit less of a racial bias‚Äîspecifically using either avoidable costs or active chronic illnesses as a target instead of total costs. We present a re-examination of this healthcare dataset to further explore the ways in which flexibility in target variable choice can be used to mitigate fairness concerns. Obermeyer et al. consider using one of each of the three different target variables, which in our framework corresponds to an index model with binary ùõºweights. For example, the cost model can be thought of as ÀÜùë¶ùêº ùëÄ =1 ¬∑ ÀÜùë¶ (costs) + 0 ¬∑ ÀÜùë¶ (avoidable costs) + 0 ¬∑ ÀÜùë¶ (active illnesses) . However, these are just three extremes among the possible set of index models that can be formed with a continuous ùõº to create a weighted average of the three available target variables.Our analysis explores whether exercising these extra degrees of freedom can lead to more equitable outcomes. To address this,we replicate and extend the analysis in Table 2 of the original paper, using the released dataset.5 Specifically, we train separate models to predict each of the three target variables (healthcare costs, avoidable costs, and active chronic illnesses) and use the fitted models to rank a held-out set of patients.6 We identify the top 3% of highest-risk patients according to each of the models and look at the concentration of outcomes and the racial composi-tion of the identified patients. For instance, when considering total costs, we compute what percent of all costs (across all patients)are covered by just the highest-risk patients. When considering active chronic illnesses, we instead compute the fraction of all ill-nesses (across all patients) covered by this set. We then extend these results by running the multi-target fairness mixed-integer program-ming (MIP), GroupSelectRateTopKMultiMIP, to search for an index model that maximizes the fraction of Black patients con-centrated among the highest-risk set. Appendix D outlines more details of this process.The results are displayed in Fig. 1 and show several key observa-tions. First, we see that, as expected, the model trained to predict a given individual outcome has the largest concentration of that outcome in the high-risk patient set. Notice that the transparent bars on the far left panel of Fig. 1A show that the model trained to predict total cost is the one that has the highest concentration of total costs in the high-risk patient set. Conversely, on the far right panel we see that modeling active chronic conditions produces the highest concentration of current illnesses in the high-risk set. Sec-ond, despite these differences we see comparatively small variation in outcome concentration across different target variable choices,with less than a 5 percentage point difference across models in the first three panels. But, we do see a substantial difference in the racial composition of the high-risk set, as indicated in Fig. 1B‚Äîmore than 10 percentage point difference. The index model, in comparison, is shown in the solid bars ofFig. 1 for ùõº = (0.05, 0.0, 0.95). By comparing the solid bars to the transparent ones, we see that the index model does a reasonable job of capturing each of the individual targets that it is comprised of, but also produces a high-risk set with a high concentration of Black patients, as per the objective of the multi-target group selection formulation (10). In effect, this represents a ‚Äúbest of both worlds‚Äù solution: we are able to fit separate models that are useful for predicting the three outcomes that may be of interest on their own (i.e., for budgeting purposes), but we also arrive at a way of ranking patients that results in a more equitable allocation of scarce resource via the index model. In the example above, we found it was possible to learn an index model that combined individual target variables from the healthcare dataset to improve group selection rates.",303-6,"In particular, there are often many reasonable target variable options.",

The index model, in comparison, is shown in the solid bars ofFig. 1 for ùõº = (0.05, 0.0, 0.95). By comparing the solid bars to the transparent ones, we see that the index model does a reasonable job of capturing each of the individual targets that it is comprised of, but also produces a high-risk set with a high concentration of Black patients, as per the objective of the multi-target group selection formulation (10). In effect, this represents a ‚Äúbest of both worlds‚Äù solution: we are able to fit separate models that are useful for predicting the three outcomes that may be of interest on their own (i.e., for budgeting purposes), but we also arrive at a way of ranking patients that results in a more equitable allocation of scarce resource via the index model.

Yet, few real world problems readily present themselves as precisely formulated prediction tasks. In particular, there are often many reasonable target variable options. Prior work has argued that this is an important and sometimes underappreciated choice, and has also shown that target choice can have a significant impact on the fairness of the resulting model. However, the existing literature does not offer a formal framework for characterizing the extent to which target choice matters in a particular task. Our work fills this gap by drawing connections between the problem of tar-get choice and recent work on predictive multiplicity. Specifically, we introduce a conceptual and computational framework for assessing how the choice of target affects individuals‚Äô outcomes and selection rate disparities across groups. We call this multi-target multiplicity. Along the way, we refine the study of single-target multiplicity by introducing notions of multiplicity that respect resource constraints‚Äîa feature of many real-world tasks that isn't captured by existing notions of predictive multiplicity. We apply our methods on a healthcare dataset, and show that the level of multiplicity that stems from target variable choice can be greater than that stemming from nearly-optimal models of a single target [...] We demonstrate our framework on a dataset released by Obermeyeret al., which is unique in several ways. The original paper examines patient data for all primary care patients at a large academic hospital. However, due to the sensitivity of the data, the authors were unable to release the dataset in its original form. Instead, they created a publicly available semi-synthetic version of the dataset that is designed to closely mirror the original dataset.4The released dataset contains several related but different outcomes for patients in a given year including total healthcare costs,avoidable healthcare costs (emergency visits and hospitalizations),and number of active chronic illnesses. It also contains a rich set of features about each patient, including demographics (age, sex, race)and information about the patient‚Äôs health and healthcare costs in the previous year. Specifically, there are indicators for individual chronic illnesses that a patient had in the previous year, costs claimed by the patients‚Äô insurer in the previous year, biomarkers for medical tests from the previous year, and medications taken in the previous year.In the original paper, Obermeyer et al. examine a proprietary scoring system used by the hospital to identify high-risk patients.The risk scores are generated by a model designed to predict health-care costs in the current year based on patient demographics and healthcare information available from the previous year. In par-ticular, patients who are assigned risk scores that fall in the 97th percentile or above (i.e., the top 3% of assigned scores) are auto-matically identified for inclusion in the hospital‚Äôs ‚Äúhigh-risk care management‚Äù program.The authors examine the assigned risk scores in detail and show that they contain a significant racial bias. Specifically, they find that Black patients at a given risk score have worse health outcomes,on average, than their White counterparts. The authors trace this bias back to the choice of predicting healthcare costs as the target variable. Due to differences in access to healthcare, White patients tend to have higher healthcare costs, on average, than Black patients of similar health. This difference is then reflected in the developed risk score, leading to the observed racial bias. Obermeyer et al. thengo on to show that there are different target variable choices that exhibit less of a racial bias‚Äîspecifically using either avoidable costs or active chronic illnesses as a target instead of total costs. We present a re-examination of this healthcare dataset to further explore the ways in which flexibility in target variable choice can be used to mitigate fairness concerns. Obermeyer et al. consider using one of each of the three different target variables, which in our framework corresponds to an index model with binary ùõºweights. For example, the cost model can be thought of as ÀÜùë¶ùêº ùëÄ =1 ¬∑ ÀÜùë¶ (costs) + 0 ¬∑ ÀÜùë¶ (avoidable costs) + 0 ¬∑ ÀÜùë¶ (active illnesses) . However, these are just three extremes among the possible set of index models that can be formed with a continuous ùõº to create a weighted average of the three available target variables.Our analysis explores whether exercising these extra degrees of freedom can lead to more equitable outcomes. To address this,we replicate and extend the analysis in Table 2 of the original paper, using the released dataset.5 Specifically, we train separate models to predict each of the three target variables (healthcare costs, avoidable costs, and active chronic illnesses) and use the fitted models to rank a held-out set of patients.6 We identify the top 3% of highest-risk patients according to each of the models and look at the concentration of outcomes and the racial composi-tion of the identified patients. For instance, when considering total costs, we compute what percent of all costs (across all patients)are covered by just the highest-risk patients. When considering active chronic illnesses, we instead compute the fraction of all ill-nesses (across all patients) covered by this set. We then extend these results by running the multi-target fairness mixed-integer program-ming (MIP), GroupSelectRateTopKMultiMIP, to search for an index model that maximizes the fraction of Black patients con-centrated among the highest-risk set.

To address this,we replicate and extend the analysis in Table 2 of the original paper, using the released dataset.5 Specifically, we train separate models to predict each of the three target variables (healthcare costs, avoidable costs, and active chronic illnesses) and use the fitted models to rank a held-out set of patients.6 We identify the top 3% of highest-risk patients according to each of the models and look at the concentration of outcomes and the racial composi-tion of the identified patients. For instance, when considering total costs, we compute what percent of all costs (across all patients)are covered by just the highest-risk patients. When considering active chronic illnesses, we instead compute the fraction of all ill-nesses (across all patients) covered by this set. We then extend these results by running the multi-target fairness mixed-integer program-ming (MIP), GroupSelectRateTopKMultiMIP, to search for an index model that maximizes the fraction of Black patients con-centrated among the highest-risk set. Appendix D outlines more details of this process.The results are displayed in Fig. 1 and show several key observa-tions. First, we see that, as expected, the model trained to predict a given individual outcome has the largest concentration of that outcome in the high-risk patient set. Notice that the transparent bars on the far left panel of Fig. 1A show that the model trained to predict total cost is the one that has the highest concentration of total costs in the high-risk patient set. Conversely, on the far right panel we see that modeling active chronic conditions produces the highest concentration of current illnesses in the high-risk set. Sec-ond, despite these differences we see comparatively small variation in outcome concentration across different target variable choices,with less than a 5 percentage point difference across models in the first three panels. But, we do see a substantial difference in the racial composition of the high-risk set, as indicated in Fig. 1B‚Äîmore than 10 percentage point difference. The index model, in comparison, is shown in the solid bars ofFig. 1 for ùõº = (0.05, 0.0, 0.95). By comparing the solid bars to the transparent ones, we see that the index model does a reasonable job of capturing each of the individual targets that it is comprised of, but also produces a high-risk set with a high concentration of Black patients, as per the objective of the multi-target group selection formulation (10). In effect, this represents a ‚Äúbest of both worlds‚Äù solution: we are able to fit separate models that are useful for predicting the three outcomes that may be of interest on their own (i.e., for budgeting purposes), but we also arrive at a way of ranking patients that results in a more equitable allocation of scarce resource via the index model. In the example above, we found it was possible to learn an index model that combined individual target variables from the healthcare dataset to improve group selection rates.",303-6,"a rich set of features about each patient, including demographics (age, sex, race)and information about the patient‚Äôs health and healthcare costs in the previous year.",
19,HighRiskConcentration,Artifact,"Prediction models have been widely adopted as the basis for decision-making in domains as diverse as employment, education, lending,and health. Yet, few real world problems readily present themselves as precisely formulated prediction tasks. In particular, there are often many reasonable target variable options. Prior work has argued that this is an important and sometimes underappreciated choice, and has also shown that target choice can have a significant impact on the fairness of the resulting model. However, the existing literature does not offer a formal framework for characterizing the extent to which target choice matters in a particular task. Our work fills this gap by drawing connections between the problem of tar-get choice and recent work on predictive multiplicity. Specifically, we introduce a conceptual and computational framework for assessing how the choice of target affects individuals‚Äô outcomes and selection rate disparities across groups. We call this multi-target multiplicity. Along the way, we refine the study of single-target multiplicity by introducing notions of multiplicity that respect resource constraints‚Äîa feature of many real-world tasks that isn't captured by existing notions of predictive multiplicity. We apply our methods on a healthcare dataset, and show that the level of multiplicity that stems from target variable choice can be greater than that stemming from nearly-optimal models of a single target [...] We demonstrate our framework on a dataset released by Obermeyeret al., which is unique in several ways. The original paper examines patient data for all primary care patients at a large academic hospital. However, due to the sensitivity of the data, the authors were unable to release the dataset in its original form. Instead, they created a publicly available semi-synthetic version of the dataset that is designed to closely mirror the original dataset.4The released dataset contains several related but different outcomes for patients in a given year including total healthcare costs,avoidable healthcare costs (emergency visits and hospitalizations),and number of active chronic illnesses. It also contains a rich set of features about each patient, including demographics (age, sex, race)and information about the patient‚Äôs health and healthcare costs in the previous year. Specifically, there are indicators for individual chronic illnesses that a patient had in the previous year, costs claimed by the patients‚Äô insurer in the previous year, biomarkers for medical tests from the previous year, and medications taken in the previous year.In the original paper, Obermeyer et al. examine a proprietary scoring system used by the hospital to identify high-risk patients.The risk scores are generated by a model designed to predict health-care costs in the current year based on patient demographics and healthcare information available from the previous year. In par-ticular, patients who are assigned risk scores that fall in the 97th percentile or above (i.e., the top 3% of assigned scores) are auto-matically identified for inclusion in the hospital‚Äôs ‚Äúhigh-risk care management‚Äù program.The authors examine the assigned risk scores in detail and show that they contain a significant racial bias. Specifically, they find that Black patients at a given risk score have worse health outcomes,on average, than their White counterparts. The authors trace this bias back to the choice of predicting healthcare costs as the target variable. Due to differences in access to healthcare, White patients tend to have higher healthcare costs, on average, than Black patients of similar health. This difference is then reflected in the developed risk score, leading to the observed racial bias. Obermeyer et al. thengo on to show that there are different target variable choices that exhibit less of a racial bias‚Äîspecifically using either avoidable costs or active chronic illnesses as a target instead of total costs. We present a re-examination of this healthcare dataset to further explore the ways in which flexibility in target variable choice can be used to mitigate fairness concerns. Obermeyer et al. consider using one of each of the three different target variables, which in our framework corresponds to an index model with binary ùõºweights.

Specifically, there are indicators for individual chronic illnesses that a patient had in the previous year, costs claimed by the patients‚Äô insurer in the previous year, biomarkers for medical tests from the previous year, and medications taken in the previous year.In the original paper, Obermeyer et al. examine a proprietary scoring system used by the hospital to identify high-risk patients.The risk scores are generated by a model designed to predict health-care costs in the current year based on patient demographics and healthcare information available from the previous year. In par-ticular, patients who are assigned risk scores that fall in the 97th percentile or above (i.e., the top 3% of assigned scores) are auto-matically identified for inclusion in the hospital‚Äôs ‚Äúhigh-risk care management‚Äù program.The authors examine the assigned risk scores in detail and show that they contain a significant racial bias. Specifically, they find that Black patients at a given risk score have worse health outcomes,on average, than their White counterparts. The authors trace this bias back to the choice of predicting healthcare costs as the target variable. Due to differences in access to healthcare, White patients tend to have higher healthcare costs, on average, than Black patients of similar health. This difference is then reflected in the developed risk score, leading to the observed racial bias. Obermeyer et al. thengo on to show that there are different target variable choices that exhibit less of a racial bias‚Äîspecifically using either avoidable costs or active chronic illnesses as a target instead of total costs. We present a re-examination of this healthcare dataset to further explore the ways in which flexibility in target variable choice can be used to mitigate fairness concerns. Obermeyer et al. consider using one of each of the three different target variables, which in our framework corresponds to an index model with binary ùõºweights. For example, the cost model can be thought of as ÀÜùë¶ùêº ùëÄ =1 ¬∑ ÀÜùë¶ (costs) + 0 ¬∑ ÀÜùë¶ (avoidable costs) + 0 ¬∑ ÀÜùë¶ (active illnesses) . However, these are just three extremes among the possible set of index models that can be formed with a continuous ùõº to create a weighted average of the three available target variables.Our analysis explores whether exercising these extra degrees of freedom can lead to more equitable outcomes. To address this,we replicate and extend the analysis in Table 2 of the original paper, using the released dataset.5 Specifically, we train separate models to predict each of the three target variables (healthcare costs, avoidable costs, and active chronic illnesses) and use the fitted models to rank a held-out set of patients.6 We identify the top 3% of highest-risk patients according to each of the models and look at the concentration of outcomes and the racial composi-tion of the identified patients. For instance, when considering total costs, we compute what percent of all costs (across all patients)are covered by just the highest-risk patients. When considering active chronic illnesses, we instead compute the fraction of all ill-nesses (across all patients) covered by this set. We then extend these results by running the multi-target fairness mixed-integer program-ming (MIP), GroupSelectRateTopKMultiMIP, to search for an index model that maximizes the fraction of Black patients con-centrated among the highest-risk set. Appendix D outlines more details of this process.The results are displayed in Fig. 1 and show several key observa-tions. First, we see that, as expected, the model trained to predict a given individual outcome has the largest concentration of that outcome in the high-risk patient set. Notice that the transparent bars on the far left panel of Fig. 1A show that the model trained to predict total cost is the one that has the highest concentration of total costs in the high-risk patient set. Conversely, on the far right panel we see that modeling active chronic conditions produces the highest concentration of current illnesses in the high-risk set. Sec-ond, despite these differences we see comparatively small variation in outcome concentration across different target variable choices,with less than a 5 percentage point difference across models in the first three panels. But, we do see a substantial difference in the racial composition of the high-risk set, as indicated in Fig. 1B‚Äîmore than 10 percentage point difference. The index model, in comparison, is shown in the solid bars ofFig. 1 for ùõº = (0.05, 0.0, 0.95). By comparing the solid bars to the transparent ones, we see that the index model does a reasonable job of capturing each of the individual targets that it is comprised of, but also produces a high-risk set with a high concentration of Black patients, as per the objective of the multi-target group selection formulation (10). In effect, this represents a ‚Äúbest of both worlds‚Äù solution: we are able to fit separate models that are useful for predicting the three outcomes that may be of interest on their own (i.e., for budgeting purposes), but we also arrive at a way of ranking patients that results in a more equitable allocation of scarce resource via the index model. In the example above, we found it was possible to learn an index model that combined individual target variables from the healthcare dataset to improve group selection rates.",303-6,"The released dataset contains several related but different outcomes for patients in a given year including total healthcare costs,avoidable healthcare costs (emergency visits and hospitalizations),and number of active chronic illnesses"

Yet, few real world problems readily present themselves as precisely formulated prediction tasks. In particular, there are often many reasonable target variable options. Prior work has argued that this is an important and sometimes underappreciated choice, and has also shown that target choice can have a significant impact on the fairness of the resulting model. However, the existing literature does not offer a formal framework for characterizing the extent to which target choice matters in a particular task. Our work fills this gap by drawing connections between the problem of tar-get choice and recent work on predictive multiplicity. Specifically, we introduce a conceptual and computational framework for assessing how the choice of target affects individuals‚Äô outcomes and selection rate disparities across groups. We call this multi-target multiplicity. Along the way, we refine the study of single-target multiplicity by introducing notions of multiplicity that respect resource constraints‚Äîa feature of many real-world tasks that isn't captured by existing notions of predictive multiplicity. We apply our methods on a healthcare dataset, and show that the level of multiplicity that stems from target variable choice can be greater than that stemming from nearly-optimal models of a single target [...] We demonstrate our framework on a dataset released by Obermeyeret al., which is unique in several ways. The original paper examines patient data for all primary care patients at a large academic hospital. However, due to the sensitivity of the data, the authors were unable to release the dataset in its original form. Instead, they created a publicly available semi-synthetic version of the dataset that is designed to closely mirror the original dataset.4The released dataset contains several related but different outcomes for patients in a given year including total healthcare costs,avoidable healthcare costs (emergency visits and hospitalizations),and number of active chronic illnesses. It also contains a rich set of features about each patient, including demographics (age, sex, race)and information about the patient‚Äôs health and healthcare costs in the previous year. Specifically, there are indicators for individual chronic illnesses that a patient had in the previous year, costs claimed by the patients‚Äô insurer in the previous year, biomarkers for medical tests from the previous year, and medications taken in the previous year.In the original paper, Obermeyer et al. examine a proprietary scoring system used by the hospital to identify high-risk patients.The risk scores are generated by a model designed to predict health-care costs in the current year based on patient demographics and healthcare information available from the previous year. In par-ticular, patients who are assigned risk scores that fall in the 97th percentile or above (i.e., the top 3% of assigned scores) are auto-matically identified for inclusion in the hospital‚Äôs ‚Äúhigh-risk care management‚Äù program.The authors examine the assigned risk scores in detail and show that they contain a significant racial bias. Specifically, they find that Black patients at a given risk score have worse health outcomes,on average, than their White counterparts. The authors trace this bias back to the choice of predicting healthcare costs as the target variable. Due to differences in access to healthcare, White patients tend to have higher healthcare costs, on average, than Black patients of similar health. This difference is then reflected in the developed risk score, leading to the observed racial bias. Obermeyer et al. thengo on to show that there are different target variable choices that exhibit less of a racial bias‚Äîspecifically using either avoidable costs or active chronic illnesses as a target instead of total costs. We present a re-examination of this healthcare dataset to further explore the ways in which flexibility in target variable choice can be used to mitigate fairness concerns. Obermeyer et al. consider using one of each of the three different target variables, which in our framework corresponds to an index model with binary ùõºweights. For example, the cost model can be thought of as ÀÜùë¶ùêº ùëÄ =1 ¬∑ ÀÜùë¶ (costs) + 0 ¬∑ ÀÜùë¶ (avoidable costs) + 0 ¬∑ ÀÜùë¶ (active illnesses) . However, these are just three extremes among the possible set of index models that can be formed with a continuous ùõº to create a weighted average of the three available target variables.Our analysis explores whether exercising these extra degrees of freedom can lead to more equitable outcomes. To address this,we replicate and extend the analysis in Table 2 of the original paper, using the released dataset.5 Specifically, we train separate models to predict each of the three target variables (healthcare costs, avoidable costs, and active chronic illnesses) and use the fitted models to rank a held-out set of patients.6 We identify the top 3% of highest-risk patients according to each of the models and look at the concentration of outcomes and the racial composi-tion of the identified patients. For instance, when considering total costs, we compute what percent of all costs (across all patients)are covered by just the highest-risk patients. When considering active chronic illnesses, we instead compute the fraction of all ill-nesses (across all patients) covered by this set. We then extend these results by running the multi-target fairness mixed-integer program-ming (MIP), GroupSelectRateTopKMultiMIP, to search for an index model that maximizes the fraction of Black patients con-centrated among the highest-risk set. Appendix D outlines more details of this process.The results are displayed in Fig. 1 and show several key observa-tions. First, we see that, as expected, the model trained to predict a given individual outcome has the largest concentration of that outcome in the high-risk patient set. Notice that the transparent bars on the far left panel of Fig. 1A show that the model trained to predict total cost is the one that has the highest concentration of total costs in the high-risk patient set. Conversely, on the far right panel we see that modeling active chronic conditions produces the highest concentration of current illnesses in the high-risk set. Sec-ond, despite these differences we see comparatively small variation in outcome concentration across different target variable choices,with less than a 5 percentage point difference across models in the first three panels. But, we do see a substantial difference in the racial composition of the high-risk set, as indicated in Fig. 1B‚Äîmore than 10 percentage point difference. The index model, in comparison, is shown in the solid bars ofFig. 1 for ùõº = (0.05, 0.0, 0.95). By comparing the solid bars to the transparent ones, we see that the index model does a reasonable job of capturing each of the individual targets that it is comprised of, but also produces a high-risk set with a high concentration of Black patients, as per the objective of the multi-target group selection formulation (10). In effect, this represents a ‚Äúbest of both worlds‚Äù solution: we are able to fit separate models that are useful for predicting the three outcomes that may be of interest on their own (i.e., for budgeting purposes), but we also arrive at a way of ranking patients that results in a more equitable allocation of scarce resource via the index model. In the example above, we found it was possible to learn an index model that combined individual target variables from the healthcare dataset to improve group selection rates.",303-6,the index model does a reasonable job of capturing each of the individual targets that it is comprised of
