9,AIDesign,Artifact,"In this section we bring together points by the artists and other participants concerning the ways artistic strategies could complementor contribute to AI design (RQ3).By its very nature, art provides a diverse range of opportunities for real world applications that optimize creative work flows enhance audience experiences; these are valuable opportunities for user-centered research and evaluation that ML designers in industry and academia can often struggle to access. Participant 6 thought that artworks allow a uniquely exploratory approach, moving beyond explaining the technical “function of something” towards showing “the degrees of freedom in how it might operate” – pointing, in other words, to alternate possibilities within the realm of actual affordances and constraints. As such, participants argued the art can act as a sandpit for uncovering issues before engineers and designers find them. For instance, Anna pointed out that GANs,which she works with, have few other real world applications at the time of the workshop, but could be soon adopted by the medical community. She also reported that as an artist she is contributing findings that are novel to science. She found that her attempts to reduce bias in a model did not work as well as expected: I spent all of the time being very conscious about bias and making sure that I had a super-balanced dataset. But what I found, even though when I did this, it wouldn't give me a totally kind of representative kind of output. Anna pointed out that this is a problem that has not yet been well covered in the literature on GANs, or more widely among the community – “I’m finding things that aren’t in the academic paper,that aren’t being talked about on Twitter.” Caroline described how artworks – like her critical design chatbot – can suggest alternative solutions that do not yet exist, and so call into question the designs we casually use day to day. The practices of the artists were seen to suggest ethical and in-clusive approaches to designing AI that may not be found in typicalR&D and lab settings more driven by commercial imperatives. For Instance, Caroline’s Feminist Dataset, which used participatory design and incorporated questions about the gendered dimensions of data at each step, slowed down the process of building with ML and forestalled adopting, uncritically, pre-made datasets – an approach that could help designers interrogate standard procedures. Participant 4 pointed out that artists do not need to make techni-cal possibilities or pitfalls more visible to practitioners, but rather the ethical and political stakes of such choices. She cautioned that she still encounters large portions of the engineering and design practitioner community who believe social, political and moral choices around AI happen “after their work is done, in circles that they do not see themselves as being a part of, policy circles, regula-tory circles.” Instead, for the AI research and practitioner community, art can contribute by...making visible the ways in which the members of those communities, when they design, develop, train,build, tune AI systems, are making social, political and moral choices, consciously or unconsciously. And making the social, moral and political agency of practitioners themselves more visible. Artists can therefore expose the political dimensions of the choices made in commercial and research contexts. Participants felt that art does not need to have an explicitly com-mercial or civic function, and for this reason, it can leave room for serendipity and the unexpected. An artwork can offer, as one par-ticipant put it, a “kind of poetry” in ways “that weren’t necessarily explicitly coded into these models, and weren’t intended by the sciences.” Indeed, Jake stressed that art should not be purely educational or it will be unengaging; it is necessary to delight audiences at the same time: If I was going purely on explainability and demystifying, then it would not be engaging for 99 per cent of people who want to engage with artwork, it’s going to be a very cold, technical thing.",938,AI design,

For instance, Anna pointed out that GANs,which she works with, have few other real world applications at the time of the workshop, but could be soon adopted by the medical community. She also reported that as an artist she is contributing findings that are novel to science. She found that her attempts to reduce bias in a model did not work as well as expected: I spent all of the time being very conscious about bias and making sure that I had a super-balanced dataset. But what I found, even though when I did this, it wouldn't give me a totally kind of representative kind of output. Anna pointed out that this is a problem that has not yet been well covered in the literature on GANs, or more widely among the community – “I’m finding things that aren’t in the academic paper,that aren’t being talked about on Twitter.” Caroline described how artworks – like her critical design chatbot – can suggest alternative solutions that do not yet exist, and so call into question the designs we casually use day to day. The practices of the artists were seen to suggest ethical and in-clusive approaches to designing AI that may not be found in typicalR&D and lab settings more driven by commercial imperatives. For Instance, Caroline’s Feminist Dataset, which used participatory design and incorporated questions about the gendered dimensions of data at each step, slowed down the process of building with ML and forestalled adopting, uncritically, pre-made datasets – an approach that could help designers interrogate standard procedures. Participant 4 pointed out that artists do not need to make techni-cal possibilities or pitfalls more visible to practitioners, but rather the ethical and political stakes of such choices. She cautioned that she still encounters large portions of the engineering and design practitioner community who believe social, political and moral choices around AI happen “after their work is done, in circles that they do not see themselves as being a part of, policy circles, regula-tory circles.” Instead, for the AI research and practitioner community, art can contribute by...making visible the ways in which the members of those communities, when they design, develop, train,build, tune AI systems, are making social, political and moral choices, consciously or unconsciously.
